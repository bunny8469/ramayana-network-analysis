                "Ascetic Valmiki enquired of Narada, preeminent among the sages ever engaged in the practice of religious austerities or study of the Vedas and best among the eloquent. Who in this world lives today endowed with excellent qualities, prowess, righteousness, gratitude, truthfulness and firmness in his vows? Who is that one gifted with good conduct, given to the wellbeing of all living creatures, learned in the lore (knowledge of all things that is known), capable of doing things which others can not do and singularly handsome? Who (among men) is selfrestrained? Who has conquered anger? Who is endowed with brilliance and free from envy? Who is that when excited to wrath even the devatas, are afraid of (let alone foes)? O Maharshi, I intend to hear about such a man whom you are able to place? Indeed great is my curiosity\". Invited by Valmiki to take his seat Narada, knower of the three worlds heard him and said with delight, \"Listen to me!\". And thus spoke. \"O sage rare indeed are men endowed with the many qualities you have described. I  ascertained one. Listen carefully.

Thereafter, having seen the preparations for installation of Rama, queen Kaikeyi who had been promised earlier with boons by Dasaratha demanded of him the exile of Rama and enthronement of Bharata. Dasaratha, true to his word and restrained by the bond of duty, sent his beloved  son Rama to the forest. Mighty Sri Rama inorder to please Kaikeyi and obey the word of command of his father, went to the forest and help the king to keep his promise to Kaikeyi. Lakshmana  beloved brother to Rama is drawn towards him. Endowed with modesty he is an enhancer of the joy of his mother Sumitra. Displaying his fraternal love, he followed  Rama who was departing to the forest.

Endowed with all virtues she is the foremost woman. The citizens and Dasaratha followed Rama for a long distance. Rama of righteous nature having approached Guha, king of nishadas, at Shrungiberapura sent back charioteer Sumantra and Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana crossed river Ganga. The citizens and Dasaratha followed Rama for a long distance. Rama of righteous nature having approached Guha, king of nishadas, at Shrungiberapura sent back charioteer Sumantra and Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana crossed river Ganga. Moving from one forest to another and crossing deep and wide rivers with plenty of waters, reached the Chitrakuta mountain by the command of sage Bharadwaja.

They raised a hut made of leaves in the forest located in Chitrakuta mountain. and dwelt  there happily resembling devas and gandharvas. When Rama had set out to Chitrakuta, king Dasaratha, stricken by the grief over the separation from his son and mourning over him departed to heavens. After Dasaratha had passed away, mighty Bharata did not desire to rule the kingdom  against the orders by Vasishta and other brahmins. The brave Bharata, who had conquered envy and hatred went to the forest in order to worship Rama's feet. Bharata reached Rama, so pleasing venerable, truthful and chivalrous, worshipped him with reverence and implored. Bharata addressing Rama said, 'You are knower of righteousness. You alone should  be the king (meaning that when the elder brother is alive, the younger brother is prohibited from ruling the kingdom)'. Although a source of universal delight, although exceedingly generous and of cheerful countenance, highly renowned and capable Rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father. Having handed over his sandals to Bharata as symbol of authority for ruling the kingdom, Rama persuaded him again and again to return to the capital. Disaaponted in his mission to take Rama back, Bharata worshipped the sandals of Rama and ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, awaiting his return. When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows  one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination (so that there would not be breach of his promise). When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows  one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination (so that there would not be breach of his promise). Having entered the dense forest Dandaka, Rama slew the demon Viradha and saw the sages Sarabhanga, Sutikshna and Agastya with his brother. As directed by sage Agastya, Rama received with extreme delight a bow, a sword and quivers with inexhaustible arrows, given by Indra to Agastya (to be passed on to Rama). While Rama was dwelling in the forest (in the hermitage of sage Sarabhanga), all the ascetics along with others (sages) inhabiting the forest approached Rama requesting for the destruction of the asuras and rakshasas seizing upon their lives. Rama promised those ascetics, who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them. Rama promised those ascetics, who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them. During his stay there a demon called Surpanakha living in Janasthana (resting place for the army of Ravana in Dandakaranya) and capable of assuming any form at will was rendered deformed by Lakshmana. Thereafter Rama killed in the fight all the rakshasas, Khara, Trisira, and Dushana with their followers in a battle who were instigated by  Surpanakha's words. During his stay in that forest Rama killed fourteen thousand rakshasas who were inhabitants of Janasthana. Having heard the slaughter of fellow rakshasa, Ravana became violent with anger and sought the help of a rakshasa named Maricha. Maricha repeatedly dissuaded him saying, 'O Ravana It  is not proper for you to enter into hostility with the  mighty and powerful Rama'. Disregarding his words Ravana incited by fate left for the hermitage of Rama along with Maricha. He with the help of deceitful Maricha drew the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) far away from their hermitage abducted Sita the wife of Rama and  slaughtered vulture Jatayu, Having seen and heard from the eagle Jatayu struck down by Ravana that Sita had been abducted Rama bewailed, choked with tears his senses dulled by distress. Then he performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture Jatayu. Wandering in search of Sita, he beheld a rakshasa named Kabandha who was dreadful, in deformed in appearance. Then he performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture Jatayu. Wandering in search of Sita, he beheld a rakshasa named Kabandha who was dreadful, in deformed in appearance. Mightyarmed Rama, having killed Kabandha, consigned his body to flames. While leaving for heavens he informed him saying, 'O Raghava, there is a female ascetic in Sabara community, performing religious duties and proficient in practising austerities. You may visit her'. Rama son of Dasaratha, destroyer of enemies and possessing great splendour approached Sabari who duly worshipped him On the bank of Pampa he met a monkey named Hanuman on whose advice he made friendship with Sugriva. Mighty  Rama related to Sugriva all that had happened right from the beginning, more importantly Sita's abduction and also to Hanuman. Hearing everything that story from Rama, Sugriva was very pleased and made a pact with Rama in the presence of Agni as witness. Thereafter Sugriva, king of monkeys filled with sorrow narrated to Rama out of friendship the entire account of his hostilities (with Vali). Then Rama vowed to slay Vali. The monkey (Sugriva) described about Vali's prowess to Rama. Doubtful of the prowess Sugriva of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed him the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain. Doubtful of the prowess Sugriva of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed him the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain. The strongarmed Rama, who was endowed with great strength looked at the skeleton and smiled within himself for a while. He kicked off the skeleton with the great toe of his foot completely to a full distance of ten yojanas (eighty miles). Again inorder to create confidence (in Sugriva), he released a single mighty shaft which penetrated seven palmyra trees, a mountain and the Rasatala. Pleased with Rama's action and convinced of his prowess he left thereafter with Rama he left for Kishkindha which was like a cave. On entering the city of Kishkindha, Sugriva the best of monkeys of reddish yellow hue roared with a great voice. There upon Vali, the lord of monkeys came out (of the cave). After convincing his wife Tara, who was dissuading from this, Vali entered into a combat with Sugriva. There, Rama killed Vali with a single shaft. After he killed Vali in the combat in compliance with the words of Sugriva, Rama installed Sugriva as  king. The best of monkeys (Sugriva) gathered his monkey forces and despatched them in various directions in search of Janaka's daughter (Sita). At the suggestion of the vulture, Sampathi mighty Hanuman leapt over the saltocean extending over a hundred yojanas. Hanuman arrived at the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and found Sita in the Ashoka garden meditating on Rama. Hanuman delivered Rama's ring to Sita as a token of recognition, related the whole story and consoled her. He then crushed the arch (of the outer gate of the garden) before leaving. After killing five commanders, seven sons of the counsellors, stamping out valiant Akshayakumara, the son of Ravana, Hanuman got himself captured (to be taken as captive). The heroic Hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to him through a boon by Brahma. He allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas with the ropes for the sake of achieving his other objective of seeing Ravana. Thereafter, he burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama.

Thereafter, he burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama. Reaching Rama the great Hanuman gifted with boundless intellect circumambulated him and infact informed him that he had seen Sita. Thereafter, Rama reached the shore of the ocean together with Sugriva and saw the ocean agitated with shafts burning like the Sun. Samudra, lord of rivers, (afraid of Rama's anger) and having appeared in his own form, and on his advice got a bridge built with the help of Nala. Rama entered the city of Lanka by means of that bridge, killed Ravana in the battle and recovered Sita. Thereafter he felt greatly embarassed (for accepting his wife who had stayed in an others. Rama spoke harsh words about Sita in the assembly. Sita, incapable of enduring such words, entered fire. With the of testimony of the firegod, Rama was exceedingly pleased to know that Sita was sinless. All the gods adored him. All the animate and inanimate beings, gods and sages in the three worlds were very pleased at this noble deed of the great Rama. After coronating the rakshasa chief Vibhishana in the city of Lanka, Rama free from distress, exceedingly rejoiced after having accomplished his objective. Having obtained a boon from the devatas (who had come to see him) Rama, revived all monkeys (fallen in the battle) and set out for Ayodhya accompanied by friends in the  pushpaka (aerial car). Rama who was a delight of all whose strength lies in truth went to the hermitage of Bharadwaja (as promised) and  despatched Hanuman to Bharata as his messenger. Again accompanied by Sugriva and recalling earlier incidents and after both of them discussed with each other, Rama departed to Nandigrama riding that pushpaka chariot. At Nandigrama sinless Rama arrived, met his brothers. They shed their  matted locks. With  Sita  restored  he regained his kingdom. The entire world rejoiced with happiness with their desire fulfilled they were content.  All people were following the path of righteousness. There was no fear of sufferings or agonies, diseases or famine. During the period of Rama's rule, no where  would men witness the death of their sons or women widowed. They would ever remain chaste and devoted to their husbands. There (in the kingdom of Rama) was no fear of fire, water, wind, disease, hunger and also theft. All the cities and villages were affluent with wealth and food grains. People lived happily as though they lived in Kritayuga. Highly renowned Rama, having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas  bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins, will return to Brahmaloka. Highly renowned Rama, having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas  bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins, will return to Brahmaloka. Rama will establish hundredfold royal dynasties and employ the four castes to do their respective duties, in this world. Rama, reigning the kingdom for eleven thousand years, will attain Brahmaloka. This story of Rama is sacred and holy. It destroys sins and is equal to the Vedas. Whosoever reads it will be freed from all sins. This story of Ramayana enhances longevity of those who read it and recite it. They will be worshipped in heavens after their death along with their sons and grandsons, servants and relations. A brahmin becomes proficient in the eighteen branches of learning a kshatriya gets lordship over landed possessions a vaisya gets the fruits of his business and sudra also attains greatness  by reading Ramayana\".

                "On hearing the words of Narada the distinguished and righteous sage Valmiki, proficient in composing slokas worshipped him along with his disciples. The divine sage Narada after having been worshipped by Valmiki in a befitting manner sought his leave and went to heaven. After Narada had gone to devaloka, sage Valmiki reached the bank of river Tamasa which is not very far from the Ganges for morning ablutions. The eminent sage Valmiki reached the bank of Tamasa and seen a descent into the river with pellucid waters, spoke to the disciple standing by the side. \"O Bharadwaja, behold the beautiful and pleasant waters of this river. This holy spot  is as clear and pure as the mind of a virtuous man. O dear one Put down the pitcher on the ground. Give me my garment. I shall take a dip in Tamasa, the holiest of places\". Asked thus by the nobleminded master Valmiki, Bharadwaja, ever obedient to his spiritual master, gave the sage the bark garment. Valmiki who had his senses under his command received the barkgarment from the hands of his disciple and wandered about in that extensive forest, looking all around. Sage Valmiki espied a pair of melodious kraunchas. Flying about in each other's in separable company there in its vicinity. A sinful and cruelhearted hunter struck down the male bird of the pair in his very  presence. The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail. The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail. Then, having seen the bird struck down by the fowler, the pious sage Valmiki was filled with compassion. Having heard the wailing of the female bird, the sage (Valmiki) moved to pity at this irreligious act uttered the following words. \"O fowler, since you have killed one of the pair of infatuated kraunchas you will be permanently deprived of your position\". Brooding over his utterances, he reflected, 'What is this that I uttered in reaction to the grief of this bird?' Very wise and learned, he (Valmiki), preeminent among sages, pondered over it (for a while) and spoke these words to his disciple. \"Occasioned by the griefstricken (state of the bird) and composed in rhymed lines each of equal number of syllables tuned to the accompaniment of stringed instruments, let it be known as a sloka and not by any other name\". His disciple, delighted by the excellent verse composed by the sage, committed it to memory which left his spiritual preceptor pleased. After having performed his ablution at that holy spot according to the prescribed ritual, the sage (Valmiki) returned (to his hermitage), pondering over the matter. Then saint Bharadwaja, his disciple humble and learned in scriptures, followed him with a pitcher full (of water). Valmiki who knows dharma entered the hermitage along with his disciple and sat in meditation and composed other stories. At that moment, the effulgent, fourfaced Brahma, creator and lord of the world, himself, desirous of seeing him (Valmiki), the best among sages, arrived. Greatly surprised to see him, Valmiki, purified by austerities and disciplined in speech, immediately got up and with folded palms stood before him. Bowing with reverence as enjoined by tradition and having enquired of his well being, Valmiki worshipped the immutable Brahma by falling at his feet and welcoming him with a seat and water to wash his feet with. Lord Brahma sat down on a highly worshipful seat and showed a seat for the  ascetic Valmiki to be seated. Having been ordered by Brahma, he also sat down on a seat. Although seated in the presence of the lord of the worlds, he was absorbed in the thought of events (leading to the death of the krauncha ). The hunter killed the sweetvoiced krauncha without any cause. That sinfulminded one with hostile feeling of capturing it, had perpetrated this cruel act, he thought. Griefstricken, Valmiki having become introspective and lamenting the plight of the female krauncha  again and again, recited this sloka. Thereafter lord Brahma smilingly addressed Valmiki, the preeminent among sages, saying, \"You have indeed composed a sloka.There is no doubt about it\". \"OBrahmarshi, at my will, this speech had originated from you. Most excellent ascetic, compose the history of Rama in its entirety (in this metre). Narrate the history of Rama who is renowned for righteousness, virtues, wisdom and steadfastness in the manner you have heard it from sage Narada. The incidents pertaining to sagacious Rama together with Lakshmana, Sita, Bharata, etc. and the rakshasas  their deeds, thoughts, unknown or known to everybody and even not known to you, will be revealed to you by my grace. The incidents pertaining to sagacious Rama together with Lakshmana, Sita, Bharata, etc. and the rakshasas  their deeds, thoughts, unknown or known to everybody and even not known to you, will be revealed to you by my grace. Not even a single word of yours in this epic will ever prove untruthful. Compose this sacred, delightful story of Rama, set in the form of slokas.  As long as the mountains and rivers exist on this earth, the story of Ramayana will prevail among the people. So long as the story of the Ramayana composed by you is remembered in this world, you will live in the upper world, the nether world and Brahmaloka\". Having spoken these words, lord Brahma vanished. At this he and his disciples were astonished. Thereafter, the disciples of Valmiki chanted this sloka again and again in delight. They were greatly astonished and spoke about it often.  This sloka of four lines, each consisting of equal number of syllables, was recited by the maharshi. Constant recitation (by others) elicited admiration (from the listeners). A thought occurred to Valmiki, who is capable of putting thoughts into action \"I shall  compose the epic named Ramayana entirely in this metre\". The renowned and sagacious sage composed a kavya with hundreds of charming verses, each containing equal number of syllables and excellent meaningful words set in metre, conferring glory on celebrated Rama. This story of Rama and the killing of Ravana composed by the sage consists of compound words, melodious sandhis and lines composed in lucid, melodious and meaningful  phrases. Listen to it.      : Thus ends the second sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the entire story of Rama from the intellecual Narada, the righteous (Valmiki) sought to know clearly more about the history of Rama endowed  with wisdom. Having performed achamana, Valmiki seated on kusha grass with folded palms, searched for the course of past events in the history of Rama by his power of penance.

On a particular occasion both the great princes who were dignified and endowed with good features, chanted this great epic in the presence of honoured ascetics who assembled at one place.  All the sages having heard the chanting (of that glorious kavya), experienced great astonishment. Overcome with tears of joy in their eyes, they praised them, exclaiming \"Excellent, Excellent\". All the sages steeped in dharma, pleased with them, praised the admirable Kusa and Lava as they sang. How melodious is this chanting, especially the verses Though it (the events) had happened long ago, it is described as if it is happening at the present moment, exclaimed the audience.  They both chanted in perfect unison in theme and passion, with their charming melodious voice endowed with the rich notes of music (sadja and other). Praised in this manner by the great sages commendable for their austerities, they chanted even with greater charm and sweetness. Pleased with the singing, one of the sages seated in the assembly presented them a pitcher. Another sage of renown got so delighted that he gave them garments. This wonderful epic chronologically composed and completed by the sage (Valmiki),  is the supreme source for poetry. The two singers, proficient in all kinds of notes recited the epic in the streets and on the principal roads. It was pleasing to hear for all. It gave long life and prosperity to the listeners. People admired them. Once Rama happened to see them. The two singers, proficient in all kinds of notes recited the epic in the streets and on the principal roads. It was pleasing to hear for all. It gave long life and prosperity to the listeners. People admired them. Once Rama happened to see them. Thereafter, Rama, the destroyer of enemies, having invited the two brothers Kusa and Lava who deserved honour. He brought them to his royal palace and extended respectful hospitality. Rama, the tormentor of enemies, surrounded by his ministers and brothers occupied the splendid golden throne. Then selfpossessed Rama, having seen those very handsome brothers (Kusa and Lava), addressed Lakshmana, Satrughna and Bharata, saying: \"Listen to this story sung by both of them, portraying excellent sense and words\". Having said this, Rama urged the singers with the lustre of devatas to commence. Both of them, with good and ample voice, chanted the kavya in a distinctly meaningful way. Tuning their stringed instruments, they sang melodiously and engagingly. The chanting of the kavya in the assembly of men comforted the sense of hearing. The listeners rejoiced in their mind, heart and the whole being. Addressing the assembly of men Rama said \"Both Kusa and Lava, even though ascetics, are endowed with the attributes of royalty. Eventhough they are singers, they are ascetics. This is even conducive to my wellbeing. Listen to the meaningful story with concentration\". Encouraged by the words of Rama, the two brothers chanted according to marga mode of singing (classical style). Even Rama who was in the assembly desirous of peace, concentrated his mind on that chanting.      : Thus ends the fourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Formerly, this entire earth belonged to  those victorious kings starting from Prajapati (Manu). Among them a king named Sagara got the ocean dug and his sixty thousand sons surrounded him whenever he went (to battle). It was from the family of mighty monarchs with Ikshvaku as its founder and the kings born in that race, the celebrated epic known as the 'Ramayanam' arose. I shall propagate this Ramayanam, incorporating the merits of dharma, artha and kama, and complete in all respects. It deserves to be heard right from the start without prejudice. On the banks of river Sarayu, a great and prosperous country named Kosala, abundant in foodgrains and wealth and inhabited by contended people, was situated. In the country called Kosala was the famous capital city of Ayodhya built by the lord of men, Manu . With welllaid out thoroughfares, the beautiful and prosperous city of Ayodhya extended for twelve yojanas in length and three yojanas in breadth. It looked splendid with its welllaid out and broad highway strewn with flowers and regularly sprinkled with water. King Dasartha, augmenting the prosperity of the great kingdom, lived in the city of Ayodhya like Indra in heaven. The city where all kinds of artificers lived had arched outer gateways, wellarranged local markets and all kinds of instruments and weapons. With matchless splendour, it abounded in eulogists and genealogists. It contained stately edifices decorated with flags and hundreds of sataghnis (missiles). The city with suburban towns on all sides had several female dancers and actors.It was filled with gardens and mangogroves. And girdled by sal trees. It was enclosed by strong fortifications and a deep moat. No enemy can ever enter and occupy that city. It abounded with several elephants and horses, cattle, camels and mules. It was embellished with a host of tributary kings who used to pay tributes and with  merchants from different countries. Like Indra's Amaravati, it was adorned by mountains and mansions with precious stones. With groups of men and women and adorned with sevenstoried palaces, it looked wonderful like a board where the game of ashtapada, is played. It was rich in all kinds of gems. Its dwellings were constructed on levelled ground with no space left unutilised. It was abundantly stocked with fine-grained rice and water which tasted sweet like sugarcane juice. The city echoed with the sounds of trumpets, mrudangas, vinas and panavas. There was no city on earth superior to Ayodhya. Like an aerial car acquired by the siddhas in heaven through their austerities, the palaces were perfectly constructed in rows and inhabited by the noblest of men.  The city was inhabited by thousands of warriors known as maharathas. They were skilled archers and sharphanded. They would not pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound. With sharp arrows or with the strength of their arms, they would kill roaring and inebriated lions, tigers, boars etc. in the forest. It was in that city (of Ayodhya) that king Dasaratha lived.

The people living in that excellent city were happy, virtuous, wellread (in the Vedas and the sastras) and content with the possessions of their own. They were free from avarice. And always spoke the truth. In that best of cities, there was not even a single householder who had not adequate wealth or who had not achieved dharma, artha and kama or who did not possess the wealth of foodgrains, cattle and horses. The lustful, the miserly, the unscholarly and atheists were not to be seen anywhere in the city of Ayodhya. All men and women (in the city) were of righteous conduct, fully selfcontrolled and prosperous with good conduct and behaviour. They were pure like maharshis. In the city, there was none without earornaments, without coronet, without wearing garlands and none unclean. And none without the anointment of fragrants on the body. (In the city of Ayodhya) there was no one who did not eat food to full satisfaction and was not charitable. None was found without wearing ornaments on the hands and bracelets on the upper arms and around the neck. Also no one could be seen who had not restrained his passions and emotions. In the city of Ayodhya there was none who did not kindle the sacrificial fire. There was none who did not perform a sacrifice. There were no thieves or meanminded persons or persons of improper descent of mixed castes. The brahmins were always interested in the performance of their duties. They had control over their senses. They were charitable and studious. They were selfcontrolled  while accepting charity and maintaining marital relations. That time there was no atheist, no liar and none ignorant of the sastras. There was no one who was jealous, incompetent or illiterate. There was no brahmin who was not well versed in the Vedangas or who did not perform religious vows. There was not even one  who would not donate in thousands. There was no one distracted or depressed. In Ayodhya, there was no man or woman who was not endowed with wealth or beauty.

It abounded with warriors, like a cave with lions. They were almost like flaming fire, the most determined among experts and accomplished in learning (the science of arms). The city was full of excellent horses born in the regions of Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu and Sindhu, similar to that of Indra's horse (called Ucchaisrava).

They never inflicted any punishment even on those who were not their wellwishers, if they did not commit any offence. They were heroic. They possessed steady perseverance. They followed the state policy and always protected the virtuous people living in the state. While ensuring that they did not cause pain to brahmanas and kshatriyas (in thought, word and deed), they filled the treasury. They inflicted stringent punishments on a man after examining his strength and weakness. While the ministers of chaste conduct administered the kingdom with unanimous decisions, there was no one who was a liar, either in the city or in the kingdom. In that kingdom no one was wicked or enamoured of others' wives. Serenity prevailed over the entire kingdom including the city of excellence. They all were welldressed in fine clothes. They possessed good character with an eye on justice and vigilant about the king's welfare. They imbibed virtues from the elderlies. They were renowned in prowess.

                "Such a majestic, righteous, and magnaninous king had no son to perpetuate the race even though he performed austerities for one. While reflecting over the matter, a thought struck the magnanimous king: 'Why not invoke gods by performing a horsesacrifice for a son'.

Thereupon Sumantra of swift movement immediateiy brought together Suyajna, Vamadeva,Jabali, Kasyapa and priest Vasistha along with other brahmins who had mastery over the Vedas. Virtuous king Dasaratha paid homage to them (the ministers) and uttered these gracious, righteous and meaningful words. There is no happiness for one who has no son. This is the cause of my intense suffering. Therefore, I have made up my mind to perform a horsesacrifice. Therefore, I intend to perform a horsesacrifice in accordance with the scriptures. How  can I fulfil my desire in this regard? You may deliberate and find a solution\". The brahmins along with Vasishta in the forefront extolled the king's decision, exclaiming, 'Well, Well'. Highly pleased, they all said to king Dasaratha, \"Requisite articles be collected for the sacrifice and the  horse be released.\" 'O king, the wish that arose in your mind is just and right. You will definitely obtain sons as desired by you.' On hearing the words of the brahmins, the king was pleased and said to his ministers with eyes excited with delight. \"Let the  articles required (for performing the sacrifice) be procured in accordance with the words of my spiritual preceptors and the horse be released under the protection of able men. On the northern bank of  Sarayu, a sacrificial pavillion be prepared according to the  methods ordained in the 'Kalpa'. Auspicious rites be performed in accordance with the ordinance for its uninterrupted completion. If obstructions and omissions do not occur in the conduct of this best of sacrifices, it will be possible for every king to get the results.

Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner this sacifice is completed in accordance with the scriptures. And in this, you are experts\". Having heard these words of this Indra on earth (king Dasaratha) all the ministers with due respect replied: \"May it be as ordered\". Bowing to this best of kings (Dasaratha), all the brahmins who were experts in austerities left all the knowledgeable brahmins as they camewith his permission. After sending away the brahmins, the king said to his ministers: \"Let this sacrifice be performed as enjoined by scriptures and as directed by the officiating priests\". Having thus ordered his ministers sitting nearby, sent this highly brilliant, this preeminent among kings them away and entered the inner apartment.

Kasyapa has a famous son named Vibhandaka. It was prophesied that he would have a son named Rsyasringa. Grown up in the forest and always moving with his father, that sage knows none other than his father. O eminent king, sage Rsyasringa celebrated in the three worlds who practises a twofold brahmacharya life (life of celebacy) described by brahmins (as vratitva and prajapatya). Worshipping the firegod and attending on his renowned father, he will spend a long time living in this manner (practising vratitva mode of brahmacharya). At this time a powerful king Romapada, mighty and celebrated would be living in the country of Anga. Because of violation of code of conduct by the king, a terrible, dreadful drought frightening all living beings will set in the kingdom. With drought prevailing, the griefstricken king, would summon all those grown old with learning and tell them. Those brahmins versed in the Vedas, said, to 'O king bring here Rsyasringa, son of the sage Vibhandaka by all means'. \"O monarch, on having brought Rsyasringa here, honour him, and offer him your daughter Santa with due reverence. On hearing their words, the king in a thoughtful mood said, 'How can the mighty sage be brought here'? Thereafter the confident king, having decided, in consultation with his ministers to bring him (Rsyasringa), sent the priest with the counsellors on this mission. On hearing the king's words, distressed and frightened by rishi's power, they   appealed to the king, faces bent down, 'We will not go'. After thinking  about the means to be employed to bring the rishi to the court, they told him they would bring the sage if they are not to blame (in case anything untoward happens). Thus with the help of courtesans of the king of Anga, when the son of the sage (Rsyasringa) was brought rains followed. The king offered his daughter Santa (in marriage to the sage). 'Risyasringa, your soninlaw, would help you to obtain sons'. Thus said Sanathkumara which I have related to you. Thereupon Dasaratha, pleased, (with him), said to Sumantra, \"Describe in detail the  means by which Rsyasringa was brought (to the court of Romapada)\".      : Thus ends the ninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus prompted by king Dasaratha, Sumantra said,  \"I shall relate to you the manner in which Rsyasringa was brought to the court. Listen to me along with your ministers\". The priest accompanied by ministers said to Romapada, \"We have thought over a plan which will never fail.\" \"Rsyasringa, residing in the forest, is engrossed in the study of the Vedas. He is not acquainted with women and sensual pleasures. By means of  such things that can cause sensual pleasures and overpower the minds of men, we shall be able to bring him to the town. Let it be decided quickly (said the ministers) Beautiful and welladorned courtesans, may be sent there. They will allure him by various means and honourably bring him here. The king, having listened to these words, conveyed his approval saying, 'Let it be done that way'. The priests and ministers acted accordingly. Having heard this, beautiful courtesans entered the great forest and remaining at a  place not far from the hermitage made efforts to steal a sight of this son of a sage (Rsyasringa), this forest dweller, this controller of the senses. He (Rsyasringa) was always content and never stirred out of his father's hermitage. Absorbed in penance he had never seen  a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth. He (Rsyasringa) was always content and never stirred out of his father's hermitage. Absorbed in penance he had never seen  a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth. One day this son of Vibhandaka (Rsyasringa) accidentally came to the place where he saw the beautiful women. Those wonderfully attired women singing with sweet voices approached the son of the sage (Rsyasringa) and said: 'O brahman Who are you? How are you subsisting? We wish to know why you are roaming alone in this dreadful forest? Could you tell us.' He had never seen such charming women in the forest. He developed affection towards them and a desire arose in him to speak about his father. 'My father is Vibhandaka. I am his own son. My name is Rsyasringa. I am known the world over by this name associated with my karma'. 'O auspiciouslooking women, our hermitage is nearby. I will extend to you due hospitality'. After listening to the words of the sage's son (Rsyasringa), all the beautiful women with a desire to see the hermitage  accompanied him. Thereafter the son of ascetic respectfully received the the strangers saying, \"(Accept) our offerings, here is water for washing feet and  here are roots and fruits\". The anxious courtesans received the offerings and afraid of the ascetic's return, made up their minds to withdraw immediately. 'O brahmin, these are excellent fruits. May prosperity be to you. Accept them and eat them without delay.' Then, all the courtesans embracing him with joy, offered plentiful sweetmeats and various items of food. The lustrous (Rsyasringa) who had never tasted any food other than what was offered by the permanent forestdwellers mistook them for fruits. The ladies apprehensive of (the arrival of) his father took leave of him on the pretext of  observance of (evening) rites. When they all departed, Kasyapa's son, the brahmin roamed (Rsyasringa) with a restless mind  charged with sorrow. On the following day, the sage armed with the power of penance, came to the place where he had seen those enticing, welladorned courtesans. All of them were rejoiced on seeing the brahmin approaching them, came nearer to him and said: 'O handsome one, come to our hermitage. A special, sumptuous hospitality will be extended to you', they said. Having heard their words pleasing to the mind, he agreed to go with them. And the women took him away. As the illustrious sage was being brought (to Anga) the god of rain (Parjanya) suddenly inundated the earth which looked cherful (with rain). The king (Romapada) went out to welcome the ascetic, the brahmin who brought along with him rains to his country. He humbly bowed down his head and prostrated before him. He gave that Indra among the brahmins offerings righteously with unstinted devotion and asked for his favour that he should not incur the wrath of the sage (his father Vibhandaka for having brought him to Anga). The king entered the inner apartment, duly offered him his daughter Shanta in marriage and experienced peace and satisfaction. Thus he (Rsyasringa) lived there, with all his desires fulfilled\" (said Sumantra).      : Thus ends the tenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"Great king, I shall tell you the way Sanatkumara, great among the celestials further narrated the story. Listen to my words which may prove useful to you (said Sumantra)\". That king (Dasaratha) will develop friendship with the king of Anga. A highly virtuous daughter named Santa will be born to  king of Anga. The famous king Dasaratha will approach the son of the king of Anga known as Romapada. O righteous king I am issueless. Let Rsyasringa, husband of Santa be ordered to perform the a sacrificial ceremony so that I shall be blessed with I son for the perpetuaion of my race. On hearing his words and deeply thinking over the matter, the prudent Romapada  agreed to send, Santa's husband (Rsyasringa), capable of blessing him with a son. The king relieved of his suffering, was highly delighted. He would take the brahmin with him and  perform the sacrificial ritual.

Having heard the charioteer's words and having obtained the consent of Vasishta, he    along with his queens and courtiers departed to the place where the brahmin (Rsyasringa) resided. Crossing forests and rivers slowly, the king reached the place where that foremost of ascetics lived. He reached the spot and saw the son of the ascetic, the best of brahmins glowing like fire seated next to Romapada. Then the king (Romapada), delighted at heart out of friendship with the king (Dasaratha), offered special hospitality with respectful salutations in accordance with propriety. Romapada explained his friendship and relationship with him (Dasaratha). Rsyasringa of great intellect in return felicitated Dasaratha. In this manner, the great among men, the king wellhonoured by Romapada, spent seven or eight days there.And then spoke this to Romapada: O lord of people, O king, It has been decided to commence an important sacrificial rite. You may send your daughter Santa along with her husband to my city. Having agreed to the departure of the sage Romapada said, 'Be pleased to go (to Ayodhya) together with your wife'. The son of the sage assented to the king's command saying 'So be it'. And permitted by him, departed along with wife (for Ayodhya). Dasaratha and Romapada, pleased with this, wished each other with folded palms and hugged each other with love. Then king Dasaratha, took leave of  his friend and set out. He despatched swiftfooted messengers to the citizens with the command. \"Let the entire city be welldecorated, perfumed, sprinkled with water and cleaned with flags hoisted.\" The people of the city having heard the king's arrival were overjoyed. They did everything as by the king. Then the king entered that welldecorated city amidst blares of conches and the beating of drums, with the best of the brahmins (Rsyasringa) in the forefront. The citizens were delighted to behold that brahmin entering the city duly honoured by the king who was equivalent to Indra in valiance He (king Dasaratha) took him in to the inner apartment and extended welcome. He thought that he has as enjoined by the sastras accomplished his objective by bringing him (Rsyasringa). All the royal ladies, experienced immense delight when they saw the largeeyed Shanta arriving  along with her husband in that manner. Honoured and worshipped by royal ladies, especially by king Dasaratha, Santa dwelt there for some time comfortably with the sage.      : Thus ends the eleventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After a long time, at the advent of charming spring a desire arose in the mind of the king (Dasaratha) to perform the sacrifice. Then bowing his head in respect to that brahmin who was effulgent like a celestial  and having won his grace he chose him to conduct a sacrifice for a son for (the continuity of) his dynasty. The wellhonoured brahmin agreed, saying, \"Be it so, let the requisite materials be procured and the sacificial horse, released\". Thereafter the king said to Sumantra, \"Summon immediately, Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali and Kasyapa, family priest Vasishta and other foremost and learned brahmins who are the official priests wellversed in the Vedas\". Thereafter the king said to Sumantra, \"Summon immediately, Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali and Kasyapa, family priest Vasishta and other foremost and learned brahmins who are the official priests wellversed in the Vedas\". Then Sumantra, a man of smart movement went immediately and brought all those brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas. After paying respect to them (learned brahmins), virtuous king Dasaratha graciously uttered these words charged with dharma and artha. \"There is no happiness for me. I am overwhelmed with grief as I have no son. Therefore, I intend to perform a horsesacrifice. I wish to perform the yaga acording to scriptural procedures. And I will have my desire fulfilled by the grace of the sage (Rsyasringa)\". When they heard these words from the king's month, those brahmins heades by Vasishta extolled the king's decision exclaiming, \"wellsaid\": The priests led by Rsyasringa replied to the king, saying, \"Let the sacrificial articles be procured and your sacrificial horse released.\" \"Since this righteous thought for begetting children has entered your mind, you shall surely get four sons of immense prowess\". Pleased to hear the brahmins' words, the king happily addressed his ministers with auspicious words: \"In accordance with the instructions by my spiritual preceptors let the articles (required for performing the sacrifice) be procured and the horse  released under the protection of warriors accompanied by the chief priest\". Let a sacrificial pavillion be constructed on the northern bank of Sarayu according to prescribed methods ordained in the 'kalpa' and other scriptures for the uninterrupted completion of the sacrifice. If in this best of sacrifices aswamedha, obstructions and omissions do not occur it will be possible for the king to get the results. The learned brahmarakshasas always look out for flaws in the sacrifice so that they can strike into it. If the sacrifice is damaged, the doer of the sacrifice will be immediately destroyed. Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner by which this sacifice is completed in accordance with the prescriptions in scriptures and you are experts in doing so\". Honouring the words of the king, all the ministers did as ordered. Admiring the great king, the knower of righteousness, the brahmins permitted by him  returned to their places as they had some. When the great brahmins  departed, the glorious king (Dasaratha) sent away his ministers and entered his palace.      :2 Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After completion of one year when spring returned, the valiant king (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion to worship celestial beings for begetting sons. After offering humble salutations and worshipping sage Vasishta in accordance with prescribed ordinance for begetting children, he obediently said: \"O foremost among ascetics O brahman, may the sacrifice be performed according to  tradition in such a manner that the sacrifice is performed unhindered. You are an affectionate friend and most reverential spiritual guide to me. The burden of performing the sacrifice which has since commenced shall be borne by you\". The great among brahmins answered him saying \"I shall do everything as proposed by you\". Thereafter Vasishta summoned those brahmins who are experienced in the sacrificerelated activities venerable and righteous architects skilled workers brick makers, carpenters, diggers, artisans, account keepers, dancers and actors, men versed in scriptures and honest, wellinformed people and addressed them saying, \"In accordance with the king's command let the work of the sacrificial ceremony be inauguarated. Let thousands of bricks be brought. Let temporary residential buildings be erected with all the comforts to accommodate royal guests.\" Thereafter Vasishta summoned those brahmins who are experienced in the sacrificerelated activities venerable and righteous architects skilled workers brick makers, carpenters, diggers, artisans, account keepers, dancers and actors, men versed in scriptures and honest, wellinformed people and addressed them saying, \"In accordance with the king's command let the work of the sacrificial ceremony be inauguarated.

Let thousands of bricks be brought. Let temporary residential buildings be erected with all the comforts to accommodate royal guests.\" In the same manner let widely spread residential accommodation be furnished with many items of food and all kinds of entertainment be provided for people from other lands. In the same way people coming from rural areas also should be duly, not casualy treated with respect. People from all castes should be welltreated with respect. There should be no insult to any one through lust on greed on anger. The people deeply immersed in performing sacrificerelated activities and sculptors be specially honoured according to their nature of work. All of them should be satisfied with money and food. Every thing should be wellmanaged. In whatever manner you do, not even the smallest things be left out. Carry out the work with love and affection in your hearts\". Then all of them approached Vasishta and said, \"everything has been wellarranged in accordance with your instruction. There is no deficiency. Everything will be done as instructed by you without leaving out anything.\" Then all of them approached Vasishta and said, \"everything has been wellarranged in accordance with your instruction. There is no deficiency. Everything will be done as instructed by you without leaving out anything.\" Then Vasishta, having summoned Sumantra said to him \"Invite all the righteous kings on earth\". \"Extend an honourable invitation to brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants and sudras in their thousands residing in all countries. You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since he is an old ally, I am telling you in advance. You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since he is an old ally, I am telling you in advance. Similarly, you may personally escort king of Kasi who is always affectionate and sweettongued. He is a friend to our king who is a lion among rulers. Likewise bring here the aged and very righteous king of Kekaya along with his sons. He is fatherinlaw to this lion among kings (Dasaratha). Bring with honour king of Anga, Romapada, famous and prosperous. He is an intimate friend of the king (Dasaratha). Bring kings from the countries of the eastern and southern regions, from Sindhu, Sauvera and Saurashtra Bring all other kings of this earth, who are friendly with us. Along with their retinues, families and relatives\". Having heard the words of Vasishta, Sumantra speedily despatched virtuous and auspicious emissaries to bring the kings. In accordance with the ascetic's order, righteous Sumantra himself quickly set out to escort Janaka and other kings. All the workers reported to the wise sage, Vasishta about the tasks completed for the sacrifice. Then, well pleased, the best among brahmins (Vasishta) said to them all \"Nobody should be offered any thing with disregard. Anything given with contempt undoubtedly  results in the destruction of the donor.\" Meanwhile kings from several countries to travelling nights and days arrived bringing with them various kinds of (precious) gifts. Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said \"O best among men, beacuse of your command, kings from various countries have arrived. I have extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station.\" Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said \"O best among men, beacuse of your command, kings from various countries have arrived. I have extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station.\" \"O king, persons with composed minds have made preparations for the yaga. Now be pleased to leave for sacrificial altar nearby to perform yaga. O foremost of kings, you ought to see the sacrificial ground full of sources of entertainment arranged everywhere, as though improvised by imagination\". In response to the words of Vasishta and Rsyasringa, the Lord of the earth (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion on a favourable day presided over by an auspicious star. At that moment the best of brahmins led by Vasishta and headed by Rsyasringa, entered the sacrificial enclosure and began the sacrifice in accordance with traditions and scriptural stipulations.      : Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After completion of one year when the sacrificial horse had returned, the sacrifice by the king (Dasaratha) commenced on the northern bank of river Sarayu. The best of brahmins led by Rsyasringa performed the rituals of aswamedha organised by the exceedingly magnanimous king. The chief priests, masters of the Vedas, conducted the rituals in consonance with traditions and scriptures. They officiated in conformity with duties laid down in the Vedas and according to law. Brahmins performed pravargya and upasada and other ceremonies as per the scriptures and traditions. Thereafter the eminent ascetics, rejoicing in their hearts performed the worship (of celestial beings) and conducted the prescribed rituals starting with morning ablutions etc. Havis was duly offered to Indra daily. The juice was extracted in the morning by pressing the soma plant. Midday ablutions were performed. All in proper sequence. Those exceedingly noble and eminent brahmins performed third pressing of the soma, in conformity with the sastras. There were no omissions in the offerings nor any lappes in the performance. Everything was done through recitation of mantras and in a wholesome way. During the days (of sacrifice) none felt tired or hungry. There was no brahmin who was not learned or had less than a hundred followers (or disciples). During that period brahmanas as well as those who have masters, (the sudras), ascetics and monks had enough to eat. The aged, the sick, women and also children ate there and knew no limit to their enjoyment. \"Give food, give, various kinds of clothes\" echoed the organisers. And they (in charge of distribution) did. There, could be seen day after day heaps of nicely cooked food, looking like mountains. Men and women who had come from various countries to that sacrifice were entertained with food and drink by the magnanimous (king). Brahmins having tasted the delicious food cooked in prescribed manner, praised saying \"Ah We are fully satisfied. Prosperity to you\". Such were the words heard by king Dasaratha. While brahmins were being served with food by welldressed men, some others wearing pendents studded with shining jewels assisted them. In the interval between ceremonies, eloquent and sagacious brahmins were engaged in various disputations, desirous of victory. Every day in that sacrifice brahmins, skilful in rituals, persuaded (by sage Vasishta), performed all their duties as per tradition. Here (in this sacrificial pavillion), there was none who was not versed in six Vedangas, not true to vows, not learned in many sastras nor adept in discussions (on sastras). When the time came to erect sacrificial posts, six posts, each made of bilva, khadira, parni, sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood, with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected. When the time came to erect sacrificial posts, six posts each made of bilva and khadira wood and many made of parni wood along, one of sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood, with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected. All these posts were prepared by knowers of sastras and by those wellversed in the performance of sacrifices. They were decorated with gold to add elegance to the sacrifice. These twentyone sacrificial posts, each measuring twentyone 'aratni' height, were welldecorated wrapped in a piece of cloth. All those posts, strong with eight sides and finely finished surfaces, wellcarved  by sculptors were duly erected. Decorated with flowers and sandal paste and covered with cloths, stood the  bright sacrificial posts shining like seven sages in the sky. The sacrificial fireplace was constructed with bricks with standard measurement by brahmins who were experts in the art of measuring land with a string or single strand. That sacrificial altar of the lion among kings, (Dasaratha), erected by welltrained brahmins was in the shape of the golden winged 'Garuda' it had three ranges and thrice as many fireplaces i.e eighteen in number. Animals, serpents and birds were kept ready after the sastras intended (for sacrifice) for those respective deities. When the time came to sacrifice the animals, the chief priests, in accordance with tradition, tied up the horse and all the aquatic animals to the sacrificial posts. Three hundred animals and the jewel of the horses (from the stables) belonging to king Dasaratha were bound to the sacrificial posts. Kausalya, with immense glee having gone round and worshipped that horse, severed it with three strokes of scimitar. Kausalya, in her devotion to duty and with a happy state of mind, passed one night near that horse. Hota, Adhvaryu and Udgata arranged Mahishi, Parivritti, Vavaata and another woman known as Palakali to touch (keep the company of) the sacrificial horse. The official priest, highly knowledgeable in scriptures and having restrained senses, removed the marrow from the horse and cooked it according to tradition. The king at appropriate time and in agreement with the scriptures inhaled the odour of the smoke (from the burnt marrow) and absolved himself of his sins. The sixteen officiating priests (brahmins) offered all the horse's limbs with prayers as per the customs. In other sacrifices oblations are offered with branches of a plaksha tree but in Aswamedha a branch of cane creeper is chosen instead. According to Kalpa sutra, aswamedha in conducted for three days. In the first day, chatushtoma is arranged. On the second day Ukthya and on the third day Atiraatra were performed. Many sacrifices fixed according to the scriptures were also performed. Jyotishtoma and Ayuryaga in Atiratra, Abhijit, Viswajit and Aptoryama ceremonies constituting the great sacrifice were performed in the prescribed manner. In order to promote his dynasty, king Dasaratha gave away eastern region to Hotar, western region to Adhvaryu, southern region to Brahma and northern region to Udgata. These offerings were made in accordance with theprescriptions by Brahma long all. In order to promote his dynasty, king Dasaratha gave away eastern region to Hotar, western region to Adhvaryu, southern region to Brahma and northern region to Udgata. These offerings were made in accordance with theprescriptions by Brahma long all. The king best among men and upholder of his dynasty, having concluded the sacrifice according to law, offered this entire earth as gift to priests. But all the priests said to the king purged of his sins, \"O Lord of men you alone are capable of protecting this earth\". \"O ruler of the earth We are constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas. We are not capable of ruling the earth and we cannot do anything with its possession. Give some other charity in lieu of that. O best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available. We have no use with this earth\". Lord of men, the king having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins. Lord of men, the king having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins. All the priests collectively offered that wealth to sage Rsyasringa and Vasishta endowed with prudence. Then those highly pleased brahmins, having distributed that wealth with equity, again said to the king. Thereafter, with earnestness king Dasaratha bestowed a crore of gold coins to brahmins who had come to see the sacrifice. Dasaratha then gave his excellent bracelet to a poor brahmin who solicited alms. When the brahmins were pleased, king Dasaratha who was fond of brahmins bowed to them with his eyes filled with delight. Brahmins uttered blessings upon the generous king when he prostrated before them according to procedure. Sacrifice destroys sins. It leads to heaven. It is incapable of being done by other monarchs. King Dasaratha was very much pleased after performing this great sacrifice. King Dasaratha then addressing Rsyasringa said \"O Adherent of vows you can help the continuity of my race\". Rsyasringa, the best of brahmins, addressing the king said, \"O King Let it be. Four sons perpetuating your race will be born to you\".      : Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rsyasringa, a highly  intellectual and knowledgeable one in the Vedas, pondered for a while, revived his memory  and said to the king. \"I shall perform putriyeshti to help you beget sons. This is to be done in accordance with tradition for fulfilment of desires through mantras as declared in a portion of the Vedas, 'atharva siras'\" . To help Dasaratha beget sons, brilliant Rsyasringa  commenced putriyeshti, a sacrifice for begetting children, by pouring oblations into sacrificial fire and chanting mantras in accordance with traditions. All the celestial deities etc., along with gandharvas according to tradition, gathered at the sacrifice to receive their share of offerings. All devatas assembled there as per tradition and thus addressed Lord Brahma the creator of the worlds: \"O lord a rakshasa by name Ravana who had obtained prowess through your grace is oppressing us. We are unable to punish him. Pleased with his penance, Lord, you had granted him a boon. By honour that boon and daily endure all his cruelty. The evilminded Ravana is inflicting pains on the three worlds. He hates the guardians of the earth and intends to assault Indra, lord of the celestials. Because of your boon he has become unassailable and puffed with pride deties sages, yakshas, gandharvas, demons and brahmins. The Sun does not scorch him  and the wind does not blow by him. Even the ocean with its incessantly moving waves becomes still in his presence. His dreamful appearance of that rakshasa strikes terror into us. O Lord do find some means to kill him\". After listening to the words of the devatas and reflecting over the matter, Brahma said,    \"Oh, the means of destruction of that wicked (rakshasa) has struck my mind\". When he asked gandharvas, yakshas, gods, demons or rakshasas should never be able to kill him, I said, \"So be it\". \"The rakshasa did not include man monkey and bear because of his disdain for men. As such he is fit to be destroyed by a man and not by any other means\". Having heard these pleasing words uttered by Brahma, all the devatas and maharshis were overwhelmed with joy. At this juncture Visnu the lord of the world, highly effulgent and bearing conch, discus and mace in his hands and in yellow apparel arrived. Lord Visnu stayed there with a composed mind after meeting Brahma Then thus spoke the devatas prostrated before Visnu and paying him homage with hymns. \"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and  generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of his three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame). \"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and  generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of his three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame). \"O Visnu assuring human form, kill Ravana in the battle. He has become a source of torment to the worlds and is invincible by gods. \"That stupid rakshasa, Ravana, with his haughty prowess, is terrorising the gods, gandharvas, siddhas and great rishis. It is reported that a cruel rakshasa with his haughty prowess has tortured rishis, gandharvas and apsaras sporting in Nandana groves. We siddhas, gandharvas and yakshas along with ascetics, have hence come here to devise ways of his death. We take refuge in you. O tormentor of enemies, O Visnu, you are the supreme, refuge for all of us. Resolve to be born in the world of men for the destruction of enemies of the gods (rakshasas)\". Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma. Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma. Lord Visnu, supreme soul having given boon to devatas in this manner, reflected as to the place where he should take birth as a man in this world of men. Thereafter, the Lord with eyes like the lotus petal was pleased to transform himself into four forms and to choose king Dasaratha as his father. Then along with gandharvas, groups of apsaras, rishis, rudras and devatas sang in praise of the 'Lord Slayer of Madhu', with hymns of celestial beauty. \"Therefore, uproot that mighty Ravana possessing frightful prowess, inflamed pride, limitless insolence causing agony to the three worlds, a source of vexation to ascetics and  a dreadful enemy of Indra. Kill Ravana, the cause of distress in the worlds, kill his forces and relatives. Them return to heaven  protected by Indra after freeing from distress, faults and sins\".      : Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Although Omniscient lord Narayana knew the means to be employed, when he was requested by the best of devatas he spoke to them softly: \"What strategies should be adopted in the matter of destruction of that evilminded Ravana who is a thorn to the sages?\". When the devatas were thus addressed by the imperishable Visnu, they replied him saying, \"You may assume the form of a human being and slay Ravana in the battle\". \"O destroyer of foes Lord Brahma was very pleased with Ravana's intense penance over a long time Pleased, with the rakshasa Brahma granted a boon to the effect that except from men, there was, for him, no fear of death from any other living beings. Ravana ignored men while seeking the boon. Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. He carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes his death is possible by men only.\" Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. He carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes his death is possible by men only.\" Having heard the words of devatas, selfpossessed Visnu chose king Dasaratha as his father. At that time, the brilliant king (Dasaratha), destroyer of enemies, who had no sons was performing a sacrifice for sons. After Visnu had decided (to incarnate) and he was worshipped by devatas and maharshis he disappeared bidding farewell to Brahma. During the sacrifice, there emerged from the sacrificial fire a mighty being with unmatched splendour, his prowess and strength. He wore a black and crimson garment. He had a red face. His voice was similar to the sounds of a drum. He had whiskers of soft and shining tawny hair resembling the mane of a lion He had fine hair on his head. He was endowed with auspicious signs and adorned with splendid divine ornaments. His height resembled a mountain peak. He walked with the strides of a ferocious tiger. Similar to the Sun in radiance, he looked like the crest of a blazing fire. This divine being held like his beloved wife both hands, a large vessel made of gold purified, in fire, covered with a silver lid and filled with payasam (a preparation of rice in milk and sugar).

With folded palms the king replied, \"O revered lord. Welcome to you. What can I do for you?\". Thereafter the one who came from Prajapati answered, \"O King you have obtained this payasam today in return for the worship offered to the devatas\". \"O Lion among kings, receive this payasam prepared by gods, conferring progeny, bestowing affluence and improving health. O King you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons. Give this to your  worthy consorts to consume it. They will bear you sons\". Dasaratha was pleased to receive respectfully the golden vessel filled with the payasam  prepared and bestowed by devatas. Overwhelmed with great joy, he, walked around that wonderful being of pleasant  countenance again and again and saluated him respectfully. Dasaratha who received the payasam prepared by devatas was highly pleased like a poor man who received wealth. Then that effulgent figure of wonderful form having given the bowl of payasam vanished from there. The inner apartment, brightened with rays of happiness, shone like the autumnal sky in the glow of the moon. He entered the inner apartment and addressing queen Kausalya said, \"Receive this payasam which has the power to give you sons\". Then Dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to Kausalya, half of the remaining half to Sumitra, half of the remaining portion (oneeighth of original) to Kaikeyi for the sake of a son. On further thinking, he gave the remaining oneeighth portion to Sumitra. In this manner the king divided and distributed the payasam among his wives separately. Then Dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to Kausalya, half of the remaining half to Sumitra, half of the remaining portion (oneeighth of original) to Kaikeyi for the sake of a son.

The virtuous wives of the king were exceedingly delighted and felt honoured after receiving the payasam . Then the excellent consorts of the king who glowed like fire and the Sun, having consumed the choicest payasam, became pregnant in a short time. The king now regained his composure of mind on seeing his pregnant wives. He looked delighted like Visnu worshipped by Indra, and hosts of siddhas and rishis.      : Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Visnu had decided to be born as the son of that great king (Dasaratha), the selfborn Lord (Brahma), addressed all devatas : Create strong and powerful beings capable of assuming forms at free will to extend support to Visnu who is  true to his word, heroic and benevolent.

Distinguished rishis, siddhas, vidhyadharas, uragas, charanas procreated (in the form of monkeys) heroic sons who became forestdwellers. Indra gave birth to Vali, chief of monkeys resembling Mahendra mountain and having a mighty body. Sun, great among those producing heat, begot Sugriva. Brihaspati begot the intelligent monkey Tara who  had none to surpass him among the monkey chiefs. Kubera begot glorious Gandhamadana and Viswakarma begot a great monkey Nala. Neela, the prosperous son of Agni the firegod who equalled him in glow surpassed other monkeys in energy, renown and prowess. Aswini devatas, endowed with wealth and beauty, procreated Mainda and Dwivida who were highly esteemed for their beauty. Varuna begot the monkey warrior Sushena and Parjanya, Sarabha of great strength. Vayu, the windgod, begot a son named Hanuman, mighty and graceful, having a body as hard as a diamond and speed equal to Garuda's. Thousands of warriors possessing immeasurable strength and courage and capable of assuming any form at will were created to kill Ravana. Endowed with bodies similar to the Meru and Mandara mountains and having  great strength, bears, monkeys, monkeys with cowtails quickly came into being. The sons of devatas retained characteristics like beauty, form and prowess of their procreator (gods). Some monkeys with acknowledged, valour were born to female monkeys with tails         Similarly some other monkeys were born to female bears and female kinnaras. The devatas, rishis, gandharvas, garudas, yakshas, kimpurushas, siddhas, vidyadharas, uragas and many others were immensely pleased. Thousands of gigantic monkeys wandering in forests were procreated from principal apsarasas  vidhyadaris, nagas, and  gandharvas.

They possessed enormous strength and power to freely wander in forests. They were like lions and tigers in pride and prowess. They all could strike with rocks, use nails and teeth and trees as weapons. They were skilled in the use of all kinds of weapons. They could shake mountains and uproot deeprooted trees. With their speed they could cause disturbance to Samudra, the lord of the rivers. They could cause cleavage to this earth with their feet, cross the mighty ocean with one leap and enter the sky and even seize the clouds. They could capture wild elephants sojourning in the forest and make the flying birds drop down screaming. A crore of monkeys capable of assuming any form at will, great monkeys and commanders of monkey forces were created. Those monkey commanders created heroic monkeys among the chief monkey clans who later proved the best among clanleaders. Thousands of monkeys dwelt on the plateaus on the top of mountains abounding in bears. Some others inhabited various hills and forests. All those leaders, Nala, Neela, Hanuman and others dwelt near those two brothers Sugriva, the offspring of Surya and Vali, the son of Indra. Endowed with the might of Garuda and wellversed in warfare, all of them  moving around tormented ferouious lions, tigers and mighty serpents . Mighty armed leader Vali endowed  with immense prowess  protected, with his strong arms all those bears, gopuchhas(cowtailed) and monkeys. Born in many forms  wih various characteristics (relating to the body and tribe), they pervaded this earth with its mountains, forests and seas. In order to assist Rama, this earth was filled with commanders of those who led the monkey forces resembling masses of clouds and mountains. They loan endowed with immense strength and fearful forms and countenances.      : Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Completed by the magnanimous king (Dasaratha). The aswamedha and putreshti sacrifices, the devatas received their share of havis and returned to their respective  abodes. Having completed the prescribed vows (in respect of aswamedha), king Dasaratha together with his queens returned to the city of Ayodhya accompanied by his attendants, army and chariots. Having been honoured by the king (Dasaratha) in a be fitting manner, the highly pleased lords of the earth (kings) made obeisance to the best of sages (Vasishta) and returned to their own countries. When the army of the kings left the city (Ayodhya) for their own, the armed forces shone bright and cheerfl. After the departure of the rulers, the exalted king Dasaratha preceded by the foremost of brahmins entered the city (of Ayodhya). Having been duly honoured by king Dasaratha, sage Rsyasringa with his wife Santa  accompanied by the wise king Romapada and his followers set out for his country. When they (guests) all departed in this manner, Dasaratha with his desire fulfilled, his thought centred on begetting sons lived happily. Six seasons (one year) passed after the completion of the sacrifice. In the twelfth month of Chaitra on the ninth day (of the bright fortnight), with Aditi as presiding deity when the star Punarvasu was in the ascendent and the five planets Sun, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus, were exalted in their own house in karkata lagna, when Brihaspati was in conjunction with the Moon, Kausalya gave birth to a son: a facet of Visnu, Lord of the entire universe who received obeisance from all the worlds and was adorned with all auspicious signs, the venerable one  to perpetuate the Ikshvaku race.

Kausalya glowed with the undiminished lustre of her son, just as Aditi with  her son Indra, the foremost among the gods and  the wielder of thunder. As an incarnation of the  fourth part of Visnu, imbued with all virtues, and armed with truth Bharata was born to Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Satrughna who were heroic, skilled in the use of all weapons and endowed with the facets of Visnu. Bharata endowed with pure intellect was born in meena lagna when pushya was in the ascendant. Lakshmana and Satrughna were born in karkata lagna with the star aslesha . Four worthy sons were successively born to the noble king (Dasaratha), endowed with all virtuous, resembling purvabhadra and uttarabhadra  stars in brightness. The gandharvas sang melodiously. Groups of apsaras danced. Celestial kettledrums were sounded. Flowers were showered from the sky. Men througed to Ayodhya to witness the festivities. The gandharvas sang melodiously.

The highways were crowded with men, thronged by actors and dancers. The voices of singers, performers on different instruments, eulogists and genealogists reverberated. The king distributed deserving gifts to priests, euologists and genealogists. He gave brahmins in charity thousands of cows and other valuables. After a lapse of eleven days, the naming ceremony was performed. Highly delighted preceptor Vasishta named Kausalya's son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, one son of Sumitra, Lakshmana and the other Satrughna.

Highly delighted preceptor Vasishta named Kausalya's son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, one son of Sumitra, Lakshmana and the other Satrughna. Brahmins as well as inhabitants of the city and rural areas were feasted. (Dasaratha) bestowed on brahmins unlimited and abundant jewels in charity. The rites at the time of birth and all other rites (associated with the newborn) were duly performed. Among them, Rama like the exalted flag, became dear to his father like Brahma he was highly respected by all living beings. All the sons (of Dasaratha) became wellversed in the Vedas. They were heroic, endowed with knowledge  and virtues and were devoted to the welfare of the people. Among them  the highly lustrous and truly mighty Rama was stainless (in character). He was auspicious to the entire world like the Moon. Accepted as skilled in mounting elephants, riding horses, driving chariots and also in archery, he was always emgaged in the service of his parents. Right from his very childhood Lakshmana, an enhancer of fortune, always remained very  attached to his eldest brother Rama, the delight of the world. Lakshmana,  possessed of fortune, was the dearest to his brother than his own body. As though he was his life without. Rama, the greatest among men would not sleep without Lakshmana's company. He would not partake even the choicest food minus to him. Whenever Raghava (Rama) went hunting into the forest, riding the horse, Lakshmana used to follow him holding bow and arrows (in his hand). In a similar manner Satrughna, younger brother of Lakshmana, became dearer than his own life to Bharata. Similarly, Bharata also was dear to Satrughna. With his very fortunate sons, Dasaratha was highly pleased like Brahma was with the gods. All his sons were enriched  with knowledge and endowed  with all virtues. They were modest, renowned, omniscient and farsighted. Dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like Brahma, Lord of the worlds. All his sons were enriched  with knowledge and endowed  with all virtues. They were modest, renowned, omniscient and farsighted. Dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like Brahma, Lord of the worlds. They (like) tigers among men, were fond of the study of the Vedas  and were always engaged in the service of their parents. They were also proficient in the science of archery. Then the virtuous king Dasaratha deliberated with his priests and kinsmen about the marriage of his sons. While the nobleminded king was thus deliberating in the midst of his counsellors,  there arrived the effulgent ascetic Viswamitra. Desirous of seeing the king (Dasaratha) he accosted the doorkeepers, saying \"Inform the king quickly about the arrival of Viswamitra, the son of Gadhi born in the line of Kusika\". On hearing those words (of Viswamitra) all of them prompted by fear because of left for the royal apartment with excited minds and hurried steps. Having reached the royal hall, they reported to the king (Dasaratha), descendant of the Ikshvakus about the arrival of sage Viswamitra. Having heard their words, Dasaratha in great joy went forth together with his preceptors to receive him like Indra receiving Brahma. Seeing Viswamitra, shining with the power of his penance fulfilled the king with a cheerful countenance made offerings with due respect. Viswamitra received the offerings as ordained in the scriptures and enquired from the king about the welfare and prosperity of his kingdom. The exceedingly virtuous sage Viswamitra enquired from the king about the treasury welfare of his subjects living in cities and villages, and the well being of his friends and relatives. Are the tributary kings submissive to you? Have you conquered your enemies? Are the rites for propitiating gods and the services to humanity  performed rightly? The foremost of ascetis, Viswamitra approached Vasishta and all other distinguised sages following the protocal and enquired about their welfare. All of them with gladdened hearts entered the royal palace and sat down, in accordance with their position after having been duly honoured by the king. Then the munificent king, very much (at Viswamitra's arrival) pleased offered him a happy hospitality and spoke: \"O great sage, welcome to you Your arrival, to me, is like nectar (to a human being), rains to the parched land, birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife, recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt. \"O great sage, welcome to you Your arrival, to me, is like nectar (to a human being), rains to the parched land, birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife, recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt. \"O Brahman! what is your desire and in what manner shall I fulfill it to your satisfaction? You are a role model for righteousness. How fortunate I am you have come! My birth is rendered fruitful. My life has accomplished its objective. \"O Brahman! what is your desire and in what manner shall I fulfill it to your satisfaction? You are a role model for righteousness. How fortunate I am you have come! My birth is rendered fruitful. My life has accomplished its objective. Earlier you were rajarshi, a warrior sage. By your austerities you have obtained the brilliance that lends radiance even to the Sun and the Moon you have gained the status of a brahmrshi. In several ways you are worthy of my worship. O Brahman your arrival has caused surprise to me. It has conferred great purity on me. O Lord by your very presence here, I feel I haved acquired the merits of a          pilgrimage. Be pleased to tell me the purpose of your visit. I desire to be given the privilege of doing service to achieve your object. O Viswamitra you need not hesitatate to tell me what ought to be performed. I shall accomplish that act in every possible special way. You are a god to me. O Brahmin I have attained this high foutune today. My great merit has been realised as a result of your arrival\". On hearing the words spoken in such an humble manner by the prudent king words pleasing  to the mind and to the ears, the great rishi of  celebrated virtues and fame, of sterling qualities experienced deep delight.      : Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard these wonderful words of Dasaratha, the lion among kings, the brilliant Viswamitra with hair on end replied: \"O Tiger among kings having been born on earth in an illustrious lineage and initiated by Vasishta, this way (of speaking) befits you. It cannot be any other way. O Tiger among kings I shall unfold the purpose conceived in my mind. Take a decision and be truthful to your promise. O best among men for the successful completion of a sacrifice I took up a selfimposed  religious observance. Two rakshasas, capable of assuming forms at will, are creating impediments to that sacrifice. When my sacrifice generally speaking, is nearing completion the powerful and welltrained Maricha and Subahu who are raining streams of blood and flesh upon the altar. The (solemn) vow for observance of religious rites being thus interrupted, I left that country as an exerted and discouraged man. O King my mind does not permit me to vent my wrath. The nature of sacrifice is such that I refrain from cursing them. O tiger among kings it is befitting of you to entrust your eldest son Rama to me who is valiant, young (having sidelocks of hair) and true to his prowess. Protected by me and by his own divine power, Rama is capable of destroying even those demons causing impediments to the sacrifice. I will confer upon him, without doubt, a lot of blessings for his wellbeing by which he will attain fame in all the three worlds. Both of them (Maricha and Subahu) will not be able to withstand Rama in any way. Rama, and Rama alone, is capable of destroying them. Proud of their strength, the two wicked demons have been noosed by Yama, the god of death. O tiger among kings they are no match for the magnanimous Rama. \"O king it is not proper for you to hesitate because of your paternal affection. You need to know that both the rakshasas will perish. This, I assure you. I know Rama who is a great soul, true to his prowess and also Vasishta of great lustre and these other sages who have been steadfast in asceticism also know. O king of kings, if you are seeking the benefits of righteousness, great everlasting fame in this world, it is fit and proper to give Rama to me. O Kakustha if your counsellors and all other sages headed by Vasishta give their consent, then only you may relieve Rama. You should spare your dear son, the lotuseyed Rama, impartial and detached, for ten nights. O (Dasaratha), descendant of Raghu act in such a manner that the time for my sacrifice is not delayed. Do not indulge in grief. Prosperity to you\" After speaking these words charged with dharma and artha the great sage resplendent Viswamitra fell silent. Having listened to those auspicious words of Viswamitra, the king among kings, (Dasaratha) experienced intense grief out of fear. He became despondent. The great king felt shaken off his throne after listening to the words of the sage (Viswamitra) which broke his heart and terribly upset his mind.       : Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing Viswamitra, words the tiger among kings (Dasaratha) lost his senses for a moment  and  on regaining his consciousness spoke this way. \"My lotuseyed son Rama is less than sixteen. I do not think  he has ability to fight with the rakshasas in a battle. Here is the whole akshauhini (army) of which I am the lord and sustainer. Accompanied  by the  akshauhini I shall engage those rakshsasas in the battle. These servants of mine are warriors, valiant, powerful and courageous, skilled in the use of weapons and fit to engage multitude of rakshasas in battle. It is not proper to take Rama with you. Wielding bow in hand I will protect the sacrifice. As long as my life sustains, I will engage the rakshasas in the battle. . I shall go there, protect the sacrifice and see that it is conducted without obstacles. It is not proper to take Rama with you. Rama is still a child, he is not learned in the science of warfare,he does not know the  strength and weakness of enemies. He has not acquired  as yet the strength of using  weapons and is not proficient in warfare. You know certainly those rakshasas are deceitful in battle. And hence he is not qualified to oppose them in the battle succesfully. Separated from Rama, I do not like to live even for a moment. O tiger among ascetics, it is not proper to take Rama with you. O sage of great vows, O brahman if at all you intend to take Rama with you, take me  also along with my army. O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since I was born.  Rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take him with you. My love for Rama among all my four sons is supreme.It is not proper for you to take Rama, the eldest son whose prime qualification  is his virtue. O best of sages, how powerful are those rakshsas? Whose  sons are they? Who are they and how huge is their body? Who are protecting them? O brahman, how to rebuff those deceitful warriors either through Rama or through my army or through me? O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess\". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said: O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess\". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said: Ravana, king of rakshasas, is the brother of Kubera and son of ascetic Visravana. He is said to possess great prowess. Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by him to cause obstacles\". Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by him to cause obstacles\". Informed in this manner by sage Viswamitra, king Dasaratha addressed the sage,  saying, \"I am not competent enough to stand before those evilminded rakshasas in the batlle\". \"You are the knower of righteousness. Extend your favour to my little son and also to me for I am so who is unfortunate. You are verily my spiritual preceptor and god. Gods, danavas, gandharvas, yakshas, birds and great serpents cannot withstand Ravana in battle. What are men to him? (They are no match to him). That rakshasa pulls out warriors' prowess in the battle. O foremost of ascetics Either with forces or with my sons it is not possible for me to engage him or his forces in battle. O brahman although my son resembles the celestials he is not experienced in warfare. On no account shall I spare him. Further the sons of Sunda and Upasunda by name Maricha and Subahu are causing obstacles to your sacrifice. They resemble the god of death, Yama. I shall never part with my son. Maricha and Subahu not only possess prowess but also are experienced in warfare. Together with my group of friends I can combat with one of the two\". Having heard the statements of the king the son of Kusika, Viswamitra who was like Indra among the ascetics was seized by great anger. As though fire in the form of  maharshi blazed like the sacrificial fire into which oblations of clarified butter have been poured.  i ph E nE Ehb M ity rmadra vmkya iky bak viassarga Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Out of affection towards his son, his (king Dasaratha's) plea to Viswamitra was full of contradiction. And on hearing the king, enraged Viswamitra replied: O king, if this act of yours is appropriate to you, I will go back (to the places) where from I came. O scion of the race of kakutstha, you have proved false to your promise. Live happily with your relatives\". At the sight of the wise sage Viswamitra seized of wrath, the entire earth shook and  devatas were gripped in fear. Great Vasishta, an adherent of ascetic practices and steadfast (to duty), seeing that the entire world frightened addressed the king, saying: \"Born in the line of Ikshvaku, you are a veritable the second god of righteousness, firm adherent of vows auspicious and virtuous. It is not right on your part to abandon your promise. O Dasaratha you are reputed in the three worlds as righteousminded. Do your own duty. Do not follow an unjust act which is unworthy of respect. O Dasaratha, a promise made and not kept amounts to destruction of merits earned through previous pieties. Therefore send Rama (with him). Trained or not in the use of arms, as long as Rama is protected by Viswamitra, just as nectar is protected by the flaming firegod rakshasas will not be able to compete with him. This (Viswamitra) is an embodiment of righteousness and unsurpassed among the powerful. None can excel him in intellect in this world. He is the supreme refuge in austerity. This Viswamitra knows the use of various kinds of weapons which no one knows among the animate and the inanimate in the three worlds. Nor will any one even know in future. No gods nor sages nor asuras in rakshasas nor kinnaras nor mighty serpents nor gandharvas nor the best of yakshas (will be able to know) All these weapons were given to Viswamitra by Bhrisasva's highly virtuous sons while he was ruling the kingdom. Grandsons (daughter's sons) of Prajapati, they (these weapons) are in diverse forms, highly energetic and full of glory they bring victory. Jaya and Suprabha of slender waists are the two daughters of Daksha. They gave  birth to one hundred effulgent sons known as astras and shastras. Formerly Jaya, for the destruction of the army of asuras gave birth to fifty sons by virtue of a boon. They  possess immeasurable power of changing forms at will. Suprabha gave birth to another fifty sons named Samharas who are unassailable,  invincible and more powerful. Viswamitra is well conversant with these weapons. Being virtuous, he is capable of creating new weapons also. Such is the prowess of Viswamitra who is a highly effulgent and highly renowned  sage. O King in sending Rama, you need not entertain any doubt. Son of Kusika, even though capable of repressing those rakhsasas by himself, it is for the welfare of your son that he is here requesting you to spare him\". Satisfied in his mind at the words of the sage (Vasishta), the full one among the Raghus' (Dasaratha) one with wide reputation, his frame shining gave his cheerful consent to the son of Kusika for Rama's departure.      : Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Vasishta having said thus, king Dasaratha, with cheerful countenance summoned Rama and Lakshmana. Rama was given farewell by his parents with recitation of mantras (for securing prosperity and averting evils). Priest Vasishta sanctified him with mantras Dasaratha kissed his son on the forehead and delivered him to the care of Viswamitra, with a heart full of cheer.

At the sight of the lotuseyed Rama accompanying Viswamitra, the wind blew pollenfree with a gentle touch. The departure of glorious Viswamitra was greeted with incessant showers of flowers, the beating of celestial drums and the blowing of conches. Viswamitra walked in the forefront. Behind him was Rama, bow in hand, while in the archer, Sumitra's son (Lakshmana) with side locks of hair followed. Rama and Lakshmana equipped with bows and quivers resembled three hooded serpents. Warriors of no less prowess, they illuminated the ten quarters and followed the high souled Viswamitra like twin Aswanikumaras  following the grandsire, Brahma. Then bows in hand, wellattired, their fingers encased in mongrel skin, for protection (against the bowstring) armed with scimitars, resplendent, young, handsome the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana shone unblemished.

After crossing a distance of over half a yojana on the southern bank of Sarayu, Viswamitra addressed Rama sweet in a gentle voice. \"O child, take this water (in your hands), let there be no delay. You will receive from me a collection of mantras and also bala and atibala. \"(If you receive these mantras), you will experience neither fatigue, nor fever nor will there be a change in your appearance. Whether you are asleep or agitated, rakshasas cannot harm you. O Rama, there is none in this world equal to the might of your hands nor does such a person exist in the three worlds. O sinless one, there is none in this world equal to you in good fortune, kindness, wisdom, in taking a decsion or giving a reply. With these two kinds of knowledge secured, there will be none equal to you, at present or in fututre. Bala and atibala are  mother to all kinds of knowledge . O Rama, best among men, scion in the line of Raghu, on your way you will not feel hunger or thirst if you recite bala and atibala. O Rama, born in the line Kakutstha and one who is righteous, these two radiant sciences are daughters of the grandsire Brahma. If you pursue these two sciences, you will get unequalled fame. You are a fit person to confer these two sciences. You possess all these qualities in great measure. There is no doubt that If these two sciences (mantras) are nourished with austerities they will assume multiple forms (and benefit you)\". Thereafter Rama, touched the water and was sanctified. With a cheerful face he received those two sciences from the maharshi who had perceived the supreme soul. . Rama, the highly heroic  after acquiring knowledge (of the two sciences) and having rendered all services to preceptor Viswamitra, appeared resplendent like the Sungod in autumn.

                "When the night turned into daybreak, the eminent ascetic Viswamitra, addressing the descendants of Kakutstha (Rama and Lakshmana) who were lying on a bed of leaves said: \"O beloved son of Kausalya, O Rama the day dawns. O best among men, awake, oblations to gods and other sacred rites are required to be performed\". On hearing the very affectionate call of Viswamitra both the brave princes had their bath and offered oblations to Sungod (standing in the water) and recited the holy name of the Lord. On performing the morning rites, the two highly powerful and and energetic princes stood before Viswamitra who was richly endowed with asceticism. They prostrated before him. And stood ready for their onward journey. Thereafter, having gone a little further both the heroic brothers looked at the confluence of holy  Sarayu with  divine Ganga divided into three branches. There they saw a sacred hermitage of anchorites of great vitality performing severe austerities for thousands of years. Exceedingly delighted to see the sacred hermitage, the two princes enquired from the illustrious sage Viswamitra: \"O worshipful one, whose sacred hermitage is this? Who lives here? Indeed, we are curious to know\". On having heard their words, the foremost of sages gently smiled and said, \"O Rama listen, who this hermitage belonged to in the past\". \"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned. The wicked Kama on his way with the maruts (god of wind) insulted Siva, the god of gods, while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort. On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at him (menacingly). \"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned.

On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at him (menacingly). \"O descendant of Raghu, burnt down by his fierce (third) eye, all the limbs of the body of that evilminded Kama were consumed. Having been completely burnt down by Lord Siva, Kama's body was destroyed. Mighty angry, Siva, reduced Kama to a 'disembodied being. O descendant of the Raghus, from that time onwards, he was known as 'Ananga' (one without form). The  beautiful place where he gave up his body is known as Angadesa. This holy hermitage belongs to Kama. These ascetics are his disciples. They are  always righteous and are free from sin. O auspiciouslooking Rama, we will stay here tonight at the confluence of both these sacred rivers (Sarayu and Ganga) and cross over Ganga tomorrow. O best of men, after morning ablutions offering oblations to the sacred fire, all of us sanctified will enter this pious hermitage\". As they were conversing thus, the ascetics, with their far reaching spiritual vision (beyond the veil of time) recognised them and were immensely pleased. After extending hospitality to the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) with respectful offerings, and water for washing feet they played the host to Rama and Lakshmana. Having received due hospitality, they delighted them (ascetics) with their talk. The rishis with composed minds recited their evening prayer as usual. The ascetics who resided there, faithful to their vows, took them in. There they staed happily  in Kama's hermitage. Foremost among the ascetics the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) delighted the charming  princes with enchanting tales.      : Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter the destroyers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana offering their morning oblations on that bright dawn arrived at the bank of the river (Ganga) with Viswamitra ahead of them. All the highminded ascetics and strict followers of vows secured an auspicious boat for them and addressed Viswamitra, saying: With the princes ahead of you, board the boat. Tread the safe path. Let there be no loss of time. \"Be it so\", said Viswamitra and paid respect to all those sages. And accompanied by them (Rama and Lakshmana), crossed the river flowing towards the sea. As they reached the midstream, Rama and his younger brother heard a sound greatly  augmented by the speed (of the river). Rama enquired of Viswamitra, the best of sages, \"What is this tumultuous sound  bursting out of the waters?\" At the words of Rama filled with curiosity, the righteous (Viswamitra) narrated the true nature of that sound. \"O tiger among men, Rama. Brahma created out of his mind a lake on mount Kailas and so that lake is called Manasa (Sarovara). This river which flows from Manasa Sarovara is, therefore, known as 'Sarayu'. It surrounds  Ayodhya. This sacred river flows from that lake of Brahma. When Ganga approaches this river (Sarayu), there is a clash of waters and this great noise is produced. Rama, offer respectful salutations here, with a calm mind\". Deeply religious (in nature) they both made obeisance to the two rivers and reached the southern bank and advanced with quick steps. He who was a descendent of Ikshvaku and son of the best of kings, (Dasaratha) having seen that untrodden and dreadful forest asked the foremost of the ascetics: \"What a wonder This inaccessible forest echoes with the (shrill) chirpings of crickets It is filled with ferocious beasts and birds producing fearful sounds. \"It resounds with the frightful shricks of various kinds of birds. Lions, tigers, boars and elephants prowl about. This forest jampacked with dhava, ashvakarna, kakubha, bilva, tinduka, patala and badari trees, how frightening this forest could be\" Viswamitra, the great sage radiating energy addressing Rama said, \"O child of kakusthsa dynasty I shall tell you whose dreadful forest this is. Listen\" O best among men, formerly these two large and prosperous cities called Malada and Karusha built by celestial architects existed. O Rama, in ancient times after killing Vritrasura, Indra was overpowered by the sin of slaying a brahmin and was affected by impurity and hunger. Devas and rishis endowed with the wealth of asceticism bathed Indra with the (consecrated) waters (brought from all rivers) from the pitchers and got him cleansed of impurities. With the hunger and the taint and impurity from the body of Mahendra removed at this place, the devas rejoiced. Cleansed of his impurities and his hunger gone, Indra once again became pure. Allpowerful Indra highly pleased gave an excellent boon to that region. Indra blessed the place saying, 'Having absorbed impurities of my body, let these places be extremely fertile and prosperous and let this be renowned throughout this world as Malada and Karusha'. Having seen the honour bestowed on that land by the wise Indra, the gods said to him, 'Well done, Well done'. O Destroyers of enemies these prosperous townships, Malada and Karusha looked cheerful with (bumper) crops and wealth for a long time. Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka, wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place. Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka, wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place. The arms (of Maricha) are round and strong. He is highly energetic. He has a large face and a huge body. In appearance, he is gigantic and possesses a dreadful form. That rakshasa always threatened the inhabitants. \"O Rama that wicked than Tataka carried on her depredations at regular intervals in these locations, Malada and Karusha. Tataka lives at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here obstructing the path. Since Tataka dwells in this forest, no one comes here (because of fears). \"By  the strength of your arms slay this one of wicked deeds. Comply with my orders and make this country safe (and habitable). O Rama none dare approach this country ravaged by such dreadful, intolerable yakshini. You have been told the manner in which this fierce forest is entirely ruined by that cruel yakshini. Tell now she has not left this place\".      : Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the excellent words of Viswamitra, a sage with unimaginable faculty. Rama, the tiger among men (Rama) replied in a, gentle voice: \"O best of ascetics, I have heard the yakshas possess little prowess. How can a woman who is by gender weak possess the strength of a thousand elephants? Viswamitra said, \"Listen, how she acquired the prowess and strength by virtue of a boon she received. \"In the past there was a powerful and great yaksha by name Suketu. He had no  children. So he performed an intense penance following virtuous practices. Rama the grandsire Brahma was highly gratified and granted to the king of yakshas, the gem of a daughter by name known asTataka. The illustrious grandsire Brahma granted her the strength of a thousand elephants, but did not bestow a son on the yaksha. As she grew up, glowing with youth and beauty she was given in marriage to Sunda, son of Jharjha. After some time that yakshini gave birth to an unassailable son by name Maricha. Because of a curse, he became a rakshasa (though born of yaksha parentage). O Rama when Sunda died Tataka along with her son wanted to attack Agastya, the best of sages. Roaring, she rushed with excitement to devour him. The venerable  rishi Agastya saw her approaching him and cursed Maricha to assume form of a demoness. Mighty angry, Agastya cursed Tataka saying, 'Abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi, a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance'. Mighty angry, Agastya cursed Tataka saying, 'Abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi, a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance'. Enraged at the curse, senseless, Tataka with anger, has been ravaging this sacred land when Agastya walked. O Rama for the welfare of cows and brahmins, slay this yakshini who is wicked, extremely cruel and possessing vile prowess. O son of Raghu's dynasty she is maligned by the curse, and so not a single man in the three worlds except you, is  competent to slay this yakshini. O best among men you need not hate killing a woman. You are a prince. You should serve the interest of the four orders of the society. Whether cruel or kind, sinful or wrong whatever contributes to the protection of the subjects, should be done by the righteous (king). This is the eternal law binding those who are appointed to bear the burden of a kingdom. O Kakutstha kill her. She knows no dharma. O Prince It is heard that in the past Indra slew Manthara, Virochana's daughter who intended to destroy the earth. 'O Rama! In olden times, Kavya, the mother of Sukracharya, the wife of sage Bhrigu, was destroyed by Vishnu determined to destroy Indra.' O Prince by these magnanimous persons and by great men several unrighteous women were killed for the common good\".      : Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After listening to the manly command of ascetic Viswamitra, Rama, of the lineage of Raghu, the son of the foremost of men and firm in determination, replied with folded palms: \"As I have to fulfill the command of my father and honour his words and the instruction of Kausika (Viswamitra), I shall execute it (kill Tataka) without hesitation. In Ayodhya in the presence of elders and spiritual masters (of Dasaratha's court), I have been ordered by my magnanimous father to act according to your instructions  and his words cannot be disobeyed. As per the words of my father and the command of Viswamitra, who has the knowledge of the Brahman,  I shall execute the welcome act of killing Tataka. For the welfare of cows and brahmins and also for the good of this country, I am ready to perform such acts as commanded by you of  boundless energy\". Rama, the destroyer of enemies having said so clinched the middle of the bow with his fist and filled the ten quarters with the resounding twanging of the bowstring. The dwellers of the Tataka forest were terrified by the sound (of the bow). Tataka, was might angry and amazed. Hearing that sound, the demoness thought for a while and senseless with anger  rushed in the direction where the sound had come from. Filled with wrath Rama saw Tataka, disfigured with a distorted face and gigantic in size. Turning to Lakshmana he said : \"O Lakshmana, behold, the sight of the dreadful hideous body of this yakshini will break timid hearts. See, she is unassailable because of the strength gained through black magic. I shall cut off her ears and the tip of her nose and make her turn away. By virtue of being a woman, she is protected. I am not inclined to slay her but take away her prowess and power of motion\". While Rama was still speaking, Tataka, incensed with fury rushed with her uplifted arms towards him roaring. Brahmarshi Viswamitra threatened her with hunkara (menacing sound), uttering, \"Auspices to the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) be aupicousness and success\" victorious. Tataka raising a cloud of frightening dust left the descendants of Raghu bewildered quite for a moment. Then invoking the power of magic, she showered extensive rain of boulders on both the descendants of Raghu. Rama was enraged at this. Rama retaliated that mighty rain of rocks with a volley of arrows. While she was advancing towards him, he cut off her hands. When she was tired and roaring in a nearby place with her hands chopped off, Lakshmana cut off her ears and the tip of her nose in indignation. Capable of assuming forms at will, that yakshini intending to delude the princes through her power of magic, vanished from the sight. She then assumed various forms and released a rain of rocks. And started moving about frightfully. On seeing them hit and thrown about by a rain of stones from all sides, the  auspicious son of Gadhi, (Viswamitra) spoke these words: \"O Rama she does not deserve any more compassion. This yakshini who is sinful, wicked and obstructor of sacrifice will regain her strength by her magical powers \". Kill her, for dusk is fast approaching. During evening the strength of rakshasas tends to increase and they become unassailable\". Addressed thus (by Viswamitra), Rama attacked her exhibiting his skill in targetting her by the sound and prevented with arrows the yakshini from showering  stones. . Prevented by a multitude of arrows, she with her magical powers, advanced towards Rama and Lakshmanaroaring. Her chest pierced with an arrow, she rushing menacingly towards them like a thunderbolt fell down dead. Having seen the slain yakshini of terrible appearance, Indra and other celestials worshipped Rama, exclaiming \"well done, well done \". Then exceedingly pleased the thousandeyed Indra and all other delighted celestials  said to Viswamitra: \"O ascetic Kausika, may prosperity be to you All devatas have been gratified by this act (of Rama) and have expressed their love for Rama. \"O Brahmarshi, you may offer to Rama, the sons of  Prajapati Brishasva who are the weapons bestowed with the power that comes from truth and ascetic energy\". \"O Brahmarshi following you with firmness of mind, Rama is worthy to receive the weapons. He who is a prince has to accomplish many such great tasks for the benefit of the celestials\". Having said these words, the celestials were pleased. They honoured Viswamitra and returned to their abodes from where they had come. And then dusk set in. Then, the best of ascetics Viswamitra rejoiced over the death of Tataka, kissed the forehead of Rama (fondly) and spoke these words: \"O auspiciouslooking Rama tonight we shall stay here. Tomorrow morning we proceed to my hermitage\". Having heard the words of Viswamitra, Rama rejoiced and rested happily that night in the Tataka forest . Freed from the curse from that day that forest looked charming and shone like Chitraratha Kubera's (garden). Rama having killed the daughter of yaksha was praised by multitudes of devatas and siddhas. He stayed in the same forest with the sage. At the first glimpse of dawn, he was awakened by the sage (Viswamitra).      :7 Thus ends the twentysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The night over, illustrious Viswamitra called Rama with a sweet smile. \"O prince of great renown, I am extremely pleased. May you prosper Out of great love and affection for you I shall make over all the weapons. With the help of these celestial weapons, you will vanquish even gods and demons, serpents together with gandharvas if they challenge you to a battle as enemies and take them as captives.

Viswamitra, the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned  east and happily, conferred on Rama collection of the unique mantras. The sage offered Rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire. While the sagacious ascetic Viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras (addressing their respective deities), all these weapons (with their mystic power) attended on Rama. The munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to Rama saying, \"Here we are, at you disposal \". Rama received the astras he felt with his hands and commanded them saying, \"Live in my mind\" (serve me whenever I remember you). Thereafter, the cheerful Rama, bowed to the mighty ascetic Viswamitra and commenced his journey.

                "After performing the purificatory rites, Rama received the weapons with a cheerful face. In the way Rama said to Viswamitra. \"O venerable one, having received these weaponsI have become unassailable even by the celestials.

'He is granting the seekers whatever, wherever and in whichever maner they, coming from here and there approach him for favour'. \"O Visnu perform this supreme, auspicious act assuming the form of a dwarf through, the power of illusion for the welfare of the devatas'. \"O Rama in the mean time revered Kasyapa resplendent like the god of fire radiating lustre with Aditi who had completed a thousand divine years of austerities pleased (with her penance) the conferer of boons, Lord Madhusudana\" (Visnu) (And she said to Visnu): \"O Rama in the mean time revered Kasyapa resplendent like the god of fire radiating lustre with Aditi who had completed a thousand divine years of austerities pleased (with her penance) the conferer of boons, Lord Madhusudana\" (Visnu) (And she said to Visnu): \"You are all ascetism, a mass of tapas, and an embodiment of tapas.

In this manner the highly lustrous Visnu, gave  possession of the three worlds to Mahendra. \"This asrama, which relieves fatigue, previously under the possession of Vamana, has come under my occoupation for my devotion to him. \"O tiger among men, wicked rakshasas who prowl about the asram and cause obstacles ought to be killed here only. \"O Rama, now let's go to the unparalleled Siddhashrama. O child this asrama is the same to you as it is to me (treat this as your own)\". While enetering the hermitage the great ascetic appeared resplendent (in the company of Rama and Lakshmana) like the moon in conjunction with Punarvasu star emerging out of  the mist. At the sight of Viswamitra all the ascetics, inmates of Siddhashrama, jumped out instantly and offered him their worship. They extended hospitality to both the princes in the same way they offered their worship to the sagacious Viswamitra. The two princes of the lineage of Raghu, destroyers of foes rested a while and then said to Viswamitra, a tiger amon sages: O foremost of ascetics Get initialed today. You will prosper and this asram will attain its fulfilment. Your words shall come true. Saying this, Viswamitra, the great saint effulgent and self trained engaged himself in the  initiation ceremony. The two princes spent the right comfortably and woke up at daybreak. They  performed morning in accordance with the prescribed rule, ablutions, said their prayers and paid their respects to Viswamitra seated at the kindled firesacrifice.      : Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus spoke the two princes to Viswamitra. They were conscious of place and time to speak and capable of conquering enemies. \"O adorable Brahmarshi, we want to know around what time the rakshasas will make their appearance so that the sacrifice can be protected. Let  not that moment pass\". The sages (of the asrama) were very pleased. They extolled the princes of Kakustha dynasty, who were eager to fight the rakshasas. \"O sons of Raghu's lineage protect the sacrifice for six nights from today. With the ceremoney initiated, the sage would  observe silence said the inmates\". At these words of the sages the illustrious princes got ready to protect the tapovana for six days and six nights without sleep. The two mighty, heroic archers (Rama and Lakshmana), destroyers of enemies attended upon the sacrifice in order to protect sage Viswamitra. Time passed. When the sixth day arrived Rama cautioned Lakshmana to be vigilant. While he was fracing up for a fight, the fire on the sacrificial altar with the officiating priests and spiritual guides suddenly brightened. The altar with Viswamitra and the officiating priests, kusa grass, ladles and square vessels, bundles of sticks and  flowers, (used in the sacrificfial fire) got brightened up. While the sacrifice was being performed in accordance with mantras, a great sound causing fear emerged from the sky. Like the clouds in the rainy season, the two rakshasas (Maricha and Subahu), covering the sky through their power of illusion, came running (to the sacrificial place). Maricha and Subahu of fearful appearance arrived with their followers and rained streams of blood (on the sacrificial altar). Flames rose on the sacrificial altar drenched by the stream of blood. Immediately Rama rushed forward and beheld them in the sky. Having seen them (Maricha and Subahu) suddenly advancing the lotuseyed Rama gazed at Lakshmana and said: \"O Lakshmana, behold, by manavaastra I shall chase, like clouds scattered by winds those wicked rakshasas who eat human flesh\". The inflamed Rama hurled the highly powerful and effulgent Manavaastra on the chest of Maricha. Smitten by that powerful Manavaastra, Maricha was thrown to a full distance of hundred yojanas into the surging high seas. Having seen Maricha beaten by the power of that coolarrowed astra, thrown to a distance, reeling and lying unconscious, Rama spoke to Lakshmana: \"O Lakshmana behold this Manavaastra associated with righteousness employing a cool arrow, which carries him away by making him unconscious and yet not taking his life. \"I shall slay these merciless, wicked, doers of sinful acts, destroyers of sacrifices and blood-thirsty rakshasas \". Then Rama took hold of the celestial, marvellous Agneya weapon and hurled it into the chest of Subahu. Struck, Subahuhe fell down on the ground. Illustrious and highly generous Rama killed the  remaining rakshasas  with the Vayavya weapon to the delight of the ascetics. Having killed the rakshasas, obstructors of sacrifices, Rama was worshipped by the hermits like Indra was honoured in the past when he was victorious. Thereafter, when the sacrifice was completed, maharshi Viswamitra beholding all the directions  bereft of evils, said to Rama:",
                "There, with their purpose fulfilled the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, full of joy in their hearts spent the night. As the night dawned, both the brothers performed the morning rites and approached Viswamitra and other rishis. Sweettongued, they visited with folded hands the best of ascetics Viswamitra who was shining like a flaming fire and addressed him  thus in sweet and generous words: \"O tiger among ascetics, we  two are at your  service. Command whatever you want and we shall execute\" it. Addressed, thus by both of them, Viswamitra ahead of all the sages, spoke to Rama. \"O foremost of men, Janaka, king of Mithila, is performing a great religious sacrifice. We shall go there. O tiger among men, come along with us. You ought to see there the wonderful  jewel of a bow. O best among men, this bow of immeasurable energy. dreadful and highly lustrous was bestowed on king Janaka by devatas in a sacrificial  assembly in the past. Neither devas, nor gandharvas, nor asuras nor human, are capable of stringing the bow by any means. Mighty princes and kings have failed to string it, in their attempt to know its strength. O best of men, O descendent of Kakustha, there you will see the bow that belongs to the magnanimous king of Mithila and the wonderful sacrifice at that place. O best among men, that excellent bow strong in the middle was offered by king of Mithila, Devarata as well as by all devatas as fruit of the sacrifice. O Rama, that bow is worshipped in the king's palace as principal deity with various kinds of perfumes, sandal paste, incense and fragrant agaru\". Having spoken thus, Viswamitra,  the best of ascetics commenced the onward journey along with the Kakutshas and rishis, taking leave of the deities of the forest. \"(O ascetics of the forest) May you be safe. My purpose has been achieved in this Siddhaashrama. From here I shall go to the Himavanta mountain situated on the northern bank of  Jahnavi\" (said Viswamitra). Thereafter, circumambulating the supreme Siddhasrama with reverence, they (Viswamitra and the princes) commenced their journey in the northern direction. As Viswamitra, the best of ascetics set out on his journey, expounders of the Vedas followed him, nearly in one hundred carriages. Birds and beasts living in Siddhaashrama also followed the illustrious maharshi Viswamitra over a long distance until he sent them back. The sages travelled a long distance and halted on the bank of  Sona at sunset. The sages who possessed great splendour bathed and offered oblations to fire at sunset and sat in front of  Viswamitra. Rama together with Lakshmana having offered respectful salutations to the sages, sat in front of the sagacious Viswamitra. Thereafter highly lustrous Rama, the best among men, filled with curiosity enquired of the great sage Viswamitra: \"O worshipful one, what could be the reason for this region shining with luxuriant groves?  I wish to hear from you. You can tell me all about this (region). May it be safe for you\" A sage of  excellent vows and rigid austerities, Viswamitra, urged by the words of Rama, described  in the midst of rishis the entire story relating to that region.      : Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "There was a great ascetic named Kusa, born to Brahma, as ascetic indefatigable in vows, knowldegeable in dharma and a respector of the virtuous. That great soul, Kusa, married the princess of Vidarbha  born in a noble family and a match for him. He begot four virtuous sons who resembled him. They were Kusamba, Kusanabha, Adhurtarajas and Vasu. Kusa addressed his four brilliant sons who were highly enthusiastic, pious, truthful and were wedded to duties of the warrior race: \"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes. \"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes. The brilliant Kushamba and the righteous Kushanabha constructed the cities of Kaushanbi and Mahodaya (as their capital) respectively. O Rama king Adhurtarajasa constructed Dharmaranya, the best of cities and king Vasu, the city of Girivrajam. O Rama this place where we are (called Vasumati) belongs to the magnanimous king Vasu. This is  surrounded by five great shining mountains. The delightful and renowned river Sumagadhi (known as Sona), flowing in the country of Magadha, looks beautiful like a garland amidst five great mountains. Rama, this Magadhi river, of great Vasu flows from the east surrounded by fertile crops fields like a garland. O scion of the Raghu family, the virtuous rajarshi Kusanabha begot one hundred beautiful daughters through a nymph named Ghritachi. Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight. Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight. With beautiful limbs of unparalleled beauty on earth, they shone in the pleasuregarden like stars in the midst of clouds. At the sight of the maidens embellished with all virtues and youth and beauty, the allpervading Windgod addressed them these words: I request you all to be my wives. You will leave this feeling of mortality and attain a long life. Youth is always unstable, especially in human beings. If you marry me, you will be ever youthful like devatas. At the works of the untiringly blowing Windgod the lunged maidens laughed and said: \"O best among devatas you move within all living beings, we feel your impact. Why do you insult us? \"O best among devatas we are daughters of Kusanabha, We are capable of pulling you down from your position. We are safeguarding our ascetic merit as virgins (we could curse you to save our ascetic merit)\" of Kusnabha. O wicked one, do not dishonour our father who always speaks the truth. He will choose the bridegrooms righteously. Do not invite death (father may be the cause of your death). Our father is our lord. Our father is god to us. Whomsoever our father offers us shall become our husband\". Having heard the words of those maidens, the most powerful and venerable Windgod became furious. He entered all the limbs of their bodies, twisted and distorted them. Their bodies disfigured and shattered by the Windgod, the maidens with tears flowing from their eyes entered the palace and fell down on the ground, agitated and overtaken by shame. The king saw his extremely beautiful beloved daughters distressed and shattered and spoke these words with bewilderment. \"O daughters What has happened? Who has dishonoured virtue? Say it at once. Who has made you hunchbacked? Standing roud me, why are you dumb?\" The king heaved a sigh and entered into a state of samadhi.      : Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the words of sagacious Kusanabha, his hundred daughters touched his feet  with their heads and  said: \"O king, the  allpervading Windgod, having taken recourse to foul means intended to outrage our modesty without and moral compunction. We have our father who is dear to us. Hence we do not have freedom to choose. You may ask our father if he is willing to give us (in marriage). As all of us were speaking thus, the sinful Windgod, disregarding our words repeatedly assaulted us. The deeply religious and highly powerful king, having heard those words of his one hundred exceptional daughters, replied: \"O daughters you have done a great act of forgiveness of which only the tolerant are capable. By taking a united stand, you have protected the honour of my dynasty. Whether for women or men forgiveness is an ornament. It is difficult even for gods. For you, daughters, to show it without any difference of opinion is especially hard. \"Forbearance is charity, forbearance is sacrifice, forbearance is truth, forbearance is glory and forbearance is virtue. O daughters, the universe is supported by forbearance\". \"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place. \"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place. At that time a great and virtuous ascetic named Chuli living in celebacy was performing austerities in pursuit of the knowledge of Brahman. When he was performing austerities, a nymph named Somada, daughter of Urmila, used to serve him. Prosperity to you Somada rendered her services with devotion and humility. There she lived a religious life. In the might time her spiritual guide was satisfied with her services. When her services came to a fruition with the passage of time, maharshi Chuli, spoke to her: 'I am pleased with you. What favour shall I do for you? May you be prosperous' Having perceived that the sage was satisfied, the gandharva who was skilled in speech said exceedingly delighted to the sage in a sweet voice. Bestowed with the great asceticism and brilliance of a brahmin, you look like Brahma. O righteous one, I desire a son endowed with the ascetic virtues of a brahmin. I am without a husband, my sire. I am not a wife to any one. Since I have taken refuge in you, you are competent to bestow on me a son with the power of your penance\". Pleased with her, brahmarshi Chuli gave her an excellent son to be wellknown as Brahmadatta born through the will of his mind. Then king Brahmadatta, son of Somada, lived in the city of Kampilya with great prosperity like Indra in heaven. O Rama, then the highly righteous king Kusanabha decided to give his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta\". The lord of the earth, highly powerful king Kusanabha invited Brahmadatta, and gave his hundred daughters in marriage to him with a heart highly pleased. O son of Raghu's dynasty that king Brahmadatta resembling Indra received the hands of those maidens' in due order. Thereafter, with the mere touch of his hand, the hundred daughters were cured of their hump back and freed from anguish. They assumed great beauty. King Kusanabha, having seen his daughters released from disfigurement caused by  the Windgod was immensely pleased. He experienced waves of delight. Then the king along with his queens performed the marriage of his daughters in the assembly of priests and sent them with Brahmadatta (to his kingdom). Somada the gandharvi was exeedingly delighted with her daughtersinlaw and praised her son for his right action.      : Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O son of Raghu's dynasty (Rama) Brahmadatta got married and left for his kingdom. Now a putreshti was performed by king Kusanabha in order to beget a son. Then, while putreshti was on Kusa the highly generous son of Brahma, said to king Kusanabha : \"O son, a highly virtuous son named Gadhi, similar to you will be born. Because of him you will obtain everlasting fame throughtout this world\". \"O Rama so saying to king Kusanabha, Kusa left through space for the eternal   Brahmaloka\". After some time, a supremely righteous son by name Gadhi was born to the sagacious Kusanabha. O son of Raghu's dynasty the highly virtuous Gadhi is my father. I am known as Kausika being born in the family of Kusa. O Raghava adherent of best religious practices, is my elder sister well known by name Satyavati. She was bestowed in marriage to Richika. Following her husband my highly generous sister reached heaven with her human body and down assuming the form of a sacred river, flowed Kausiki. Conferring the benefit of the other world and worldly pleasures on men my sister  Kausiki who is divine and beautiful having sacred waters took resort in Himavat mountain and started flowing from there. O son of the Raghus', from then onwards with affection towards my sister Kausiki, I am  living happily in the vicinity of Himavat mountains. Satyavati is sacred, firmly established in truth and righteousness. She is chaste holy and best among rivers. She is known as river Kausiki. Rama, for the sake of  observance of austerity I have come to Siddhaashrama leaving her behind. Having reached here, I have fulfilled my desire through your valour. O mightyarmed Rama since you asked me I narrated this, my origin, the history of my family and the history of this place. O son of the Kakusthas while telling my stories, midnight has passed by. Go to sleep now. Prosperity to you. Let there be no obstacles on our way. O son of the Raghus' the trees stand motionless, with the beasts and birds calm, all directions are pervaded with darkness. Evening has gradually disappeared. The sky is littered with stars and planets gleaming points of light as though they are the eyes of the skies. O Lord the Moon with his cool rays, dispelling the darkness of the earth and delighting the minds of all living beings in this world, is rising higher and higher. All nocturnal creatures groups of yakshas and rakshasas and dreadful eaters of human flesh are moving here and there\". Having spoken thus the highly lustrous, great ascetic rested. All sages praised him, saying, \"wellsaid wellsaid\" This is the family of the Kusas, venerable always devoted to dharma, foremost of men, great like Lord Brahma. \"Highly illustrious Viswamitra, you  are similar to Brahma. Among the rivers, Kausiki is the best, refurbishing the image of your dynasty\". In this way, adored by the best of ascetics, the auspicious son of Kusika, went to sleep like the lustrous Sun setting.

It is time for morning rituals. Arise, arise May the day bring good news Get ready for the onward journey\". On hearing his words Rama performed morning oblations and getting ready for the onward journey spoke: \"O knower of Brahman Clean waters of this river are adorned with sandbanks. This Sona is deep. Which way shall we cross this river? Having been addressed by Rama thus Viswamitra said, \"We shall take the way the ascetics have gone before\". With these words of the wise Viswamitra the ascetics moved forward surveying various forests. After travelling a long distance for half a day, they saw Jahnavi, the best among rivers  haunted or worshipped by ascetics. On seeing the river Ganga with swans and cranes floating on the surface of the  sacred waters, all the sages including the sons of the Raghus (Rama and Lakshmana) were delighted. The birds had made the bank of the river their home. They (Rama and Lakshmana) took a dip and offered traditional oblations to ancestors.

O Rama, tormentor of enemies, while Lord Siva was thus absorbed in sexual enjoyment, a hundred (celestial) years passed but no son was born to them. \"Then the devatas led by Brahma were exceedingly alarmed. 'Who will be able to bear the power of the offspring if it is born here and now', they reflected. All devatas approached Siva and paying their obeisance said, \"O God of the gods engaged in the welfare of all O Mahadeva accept our salutations Be king which you can be (if you will)\". \"O best among the gods, the worlds cannot contain your energy (the son born of your energy) You may engage yourself in penance in the company of Uma in conformity with the Vedas.

O best of devatas tell me\". Thus questioned, all the devatas replied to the bearer of the flag with bull as its symbol (Siva), saying, \"The earth will contain the disturbed vital fluid\". Thus replied by the devatas, the god of the gods released his vital fluid  on earth. It pervaded the entire earth including mountains and forests. Then, the devatas said to the firegod, \"Enter this energy (creative power) related to Rudra followed by the windgod\". That energy pervaded by fire was transformed into the White Mountain. It turned the forest of reeds (Saravana) (blazing) like the fire or the Sun. From that fire was born the glorious Kartikeya. Thereafter highly pleased with the event the devatas along with the saints worshipped Siva and goddess Uma with deep devotion. \"Rama thereafter Uma, daughter of the mountain (Himavan) with her eyes red with anger cursed all of them: \"From today onwards your wives will become childless\" cursed Uma.

He is engrossed in great penance along with Uma . \"O Knower of law and order O Grandsire verily you are our supreme refuge committed to the welfare of the worlds. Tell us what we should do in this matter (now that we cannot procreate a general on account of Uma's curse)\".

O god, possessed of mighty energy, release the vital fluid of Iswara in Ganga, daughter of the king of mountains. \"The Firegod gave his consent. The devatas approached Ganga and said, 'O goddess bear the energy of Siva (inyour world) since this cause is dear to the gods'. \"Hearing the words of the Firegod, Ganga assumed a divine form. Beholding her glory, the god of fire pervaded her from all sides.

Ganga addressing the Firegod standing ahead of all the devatas said 'O god of fire, I am incapable of holding your everincreasing splendour. The fiery fluid is burning me. My consciousness is overwhelmed'. Thereafter the Firegod who is the partaker of oblations offered to all deities said to Ganga 'Place this embryo on this slope of Mountain Himavan'. \"O glorious, sinless one, (Rama) hearing the words of the Firegod, Ganga then expelled that resplendent embryo from her streams. The embryo that emerged from Ganga reached the earth. It resembled the lustre of molten gold. It furned into gold auspicious, bright and pure. There copper and iron were produced from its acidity, zinc and lead from its residue. Various minerals were formed when that embryo reached the earth.

Thereafter Kumara was born (out of Ganga's womb). The gods together with Indra arranged six nymphs (stars) to act  as nurses to suckle Kumara as their own offspring. Those krittikas, having decided among themselves and having made an agreement with the gods saying 'This boy shall become a son to all of us' fed the newborn with their milk (breast milk). Thereafter, all the gods said, 'This son shall become renowned in the three worlds as Karttikeya, (son of krittikas). There is no doubt '.

                "Viswamitra, an offspring of Kusika having related the story (of Karthikeya) to the son of the Kakusthas (Rama) said again. \"In olden days there lived a brave and righteous king named Sagara who was ruler of Ayodhya. He was childless and desired to have children, O Rama the daughter of the king of Vidarbha by name Kesini was Sagara's eldest wife who was righteous and truthful. The daughter of Arishtanemi named Sumati was the second wife of Sagara and  none surpassed her in charm on earth. The king (Sagara) accompanied by his wives reached Himavat mountain and engaged  himself in severe austerities on a peak called Bhriguprasravana. When Sagara completed a hundred years in austerities, highly pleased by his performance, ascetic Bhrugu, the best among the truthful granted him a boon. O sinless one, you will get a very great progeny, O best among men you will acquire unparalleled fame in this world. O child, one wife will beget a son who will perpetuate your race and the other, sixty thousand sons, said Bhrugu. Thereafter, both the daughters of the king were exceedingly delighted. Having propitiated  that magnanimous asectic both of them with folded hands in supplication, said: O knower of Brahman which of us will beget one, and who many sons? O Brahmarshi we wish to hear. Let your words come true\". Hearing their words, highly virtuous Bhrugu made an excellent statement saying, 'In this matter, you may exercise your free will'. 'What would you wish? One son who perpetuates the race or many possessed of mighty strength endowed with fame and perseverance?' (asked Bhrugu). \"O Rama, delight of the descendants of Raghus, on hearing the words of the  ascetic in the presence of king Sagara, Kesini chose the boon to have a son who perpetuates the race. Then, Sumati (the other wife) sister of Suparna (Garuda) obtained the boon of sixty thousand sons endowed with fame and great perseverance. O son of the Raghus the king along with his wives, having circumambulated saint Bhrugu, bowed his head in reverence, saluted him with folded hands and returned to his capital. After lapse of some time, the eldest wife Kesini gave birth to a son wellknown by name Asamanjasa. O best among men, Sumati gave birth to a gourdlike foetus and when it burst open, sixty thousand sons emerged. Nurses placed all of them in pots filled with clarified butter and fostered them. They attained adolescence after a long time. Then, after a long time Sagara's sixty thousand sons attained beauty and youth. O best among men, delight of the Raghus (in the mean time) sagara's eldest son  Asamanjasa, used to seize hold of children and throw them into the waters of river Sarayu. And while they were drowning, he was laughing. Thus this son inclined towards evil and formenting the good citizens was banished (of the king) from the capital for his indulgence in malevolent acts. Asamanjasa's son was Anshuman. He was valiant, beloved and courteous to every one in the world. O best among men after a long time, a thought came to the mind of Sagara to definitely perform a sacrifice. O Rama having determined to perform a sacrifice, he (Sagara) versed in the Vedas, started the initiatory rites for the sacrifice in the company of high priests\".      : 2 Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

Prosperity to you\".

Himavan and Vindhya came close and began looking at one another. (because both are of extreme height and in between them there was no obstruction). \"O best of men, the sacrifice took place in the region in between these two  mountains. O tiger among men the region was appropriate for conducting sacrificial acts. \"O child, O son of the Kakutsthas, the great charioteer Anshuman (who can fight with eleven thousand charioteers), wielding a strong bow  followed the  sacrificial horse (in order to protect it) in compliance with Sagara's wish. On the concluding day of the fortnight (full moon day) while the sacrifice was being performed, Vasava (Indra) assuming the form of rakshasa, had stolen away Sagara's sacrificial horse. O son of the Kakutsthas, when the magnanimous king Sagara's sacrificial horse was stolen away, all the high priests addressing the performer of the sacrifice said: 'O Kakutstha on this auspicious (fullmoon) day the sacrificial horse has been stolen away suddenly and forcibly. Slay the thief and bring back the horse'. 'This flaw in sacrifice will be inauspicious for all of us. Hence O king do everything which will ensure flawlessness to this sacrifice'. Having heard the words of the officiating priests, the king (Sagara) addressed his sixty thousand sons in the sacrificial assembly, saying: 'O Best among men, O sons I do not the hand of rakshasas in this as this great sacrifice is consecrated by mantras (to prevent any interruption) and is presided over by eminent priests. 'Therefore my sons, go and search this entire earth surrounded by oceans. May you be safe'.

Possessed of great strength, they beheld also in the western quarter a  great elephant of the quarter named Saumanasa resembling a mountain. Having paid homage and enquiring as to his wellbeing, they arrived at the northern  region by digging the earth. O Rama in the northern region, they beheld an auspicious elephant named Bhadra, who was white like snow, was holding that quater. Then all sixty thousand sons having touched the elephant and circumambulated it, penetrated the earth. Subsequently, the sons of Sagara, having gone towards the celebrated northeastern region began to dig with wrath.

Exceedingly valiant Ashuman beheld the elephant of the quarter worshipped by daityas, danavas, rakshasas, pisachas, birds and serpents. Having circumambulated the elephant, he (Anshuman) enquired about his wellbeing, the where abouts of his uncles and also about the one who had stolen the sacrificial horse. Having listened to the words of Anshuman the elephant of the quarter replied, 'O Anshuman, son of Asamanjasa having fulfilled your objective, you will go back soon with the horse'. Having listened to the words of the elephant, Anshuman started enquring the well being of each of the guardians (elephants) of the quarters successively with due respect: All those elephants of the quarters were knowers of the essence of words and proficient in the right use of words.

Considering the waters fallen from the head of Siva sacred, devatas, rishis and gandharvas and those living on earth touched it (with reverence). Those cursed to fall from heaven to earth were absolved of their sins after bathing there (in the waters of Ganga).

Could you tell me? Great is my curiosity. May you prosper\" Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, hearing the words of Rama commenced to relate the history of the ancient city of Vishala. \"O Rama hear the auspicious legend of Indra. Listen, too, what had happened to this country. O Blessed Rama in kritayuga, the sons of Diti were very strong and those of Aditi were spirited and righteous. O Best among men a thought came to those illustrious ones, 'how can we be  free from old age, death and disease'? \"O Rama While the noble sons were reflecting over this matter an idea flashed across their minds to get nectar by churning the ocean of milk. Thereupon, having decided to churn (the ocean mind) those very powerful ones, made Vasuki, (the great snake), as a rope and Mandara mountain as the churning rod.And started churning it. After a thousand years, the hoods of the snake made as rope vomitted venom and started biting the rocks of the Mandara mountain with their teeth. Therefrom was produced halahala, virulent venom resembling fire.The entire universe  consisting of devatas, asuras and mortals was burnt down. The devatas sought refuge in the great god Rudra who causes happiness, the Lord of all living beings. 'Save us, Save us', the cried. Thereupon, Hari the Lord of celestial beings extolled by the devatas appeared bearing the conch and discus. Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra \"O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom.\" Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra \"O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom.\" Visnu, the highest among the devatas having the spoken, vanished. Siva who had heard Visnu's words and seen the fear of the gods received that  dreadful halahala treating it as nectar. Lord of the gods, venerable Siva went away to his abode leaving behind the devatas. O Descendant of Raghu then all the devatas and asuras resumed churning. 'O Sinless one after the mountain (Mandara) used as churning rod sank down to nether world (patala) the devatas along with the gandharvas invoked Visnu'. \"O mightyarmed Visnu you are the ultimate refuge for all living beings, specially for the devatas. Protect us, you (alone) are fit to lift up the Mandara mountain\". Having heard these words, the controller of the sense organs, Visnu, assumed the form of a tortoise reclined in the ocean supporting the mountain on its back. Visnu, the Supreme being, the soul of the universe standing amidst the devatas took hold of the peak of mountain with his hand and continued to churn the ocean. In this way thousand years rolled by. In the beginining came out Dhanvantari holding a staff and a water pot (carried by ascetics) and apsaras of high lustre. O Best among men excellent women emerged out of the essence produced by churning of waters. Therefore they are known as apsarasas. O Kakutstha there appeared sixty crore highly lustrous apsarasas. Their  attendants were countless in number. Neither devas nor danavas accept them in marriage. Unmarried, all of them have been regarded as belonging to all. O Joy of the Raghus (Rama) thereafter Varuna's daughter Varuni (goddess of wine) came out searching for a consort. O Rama while Diti's sons did not accept the unblemished Varuni, O heroic one, the sons of Aditi did. For that reason, sons of Diti were called asuras. Aditi's sons were known as suras. Devatas grew exceedingly glad for having Varuni. O Foremost among men (Rama) ucchaishravas, the best of horses (the celestial horse), kausthubham, the best jewel and also nectar came (from churning). O Rama the race of devatas and daityas suffered great destruction because of (their fight for) that nectar. Thereafter Aditi's sons, the devatas killed Diti's sons, the daityas. O Heroic Rama all the asuras along with the rakshasas joined on one side. A violent and a dreadful battle which threw the three worlds in to a great confusion, ensued. When everything was destroyed completely, the exceedingly powerful Visnu assuming the form of Mohini a charming woman (elusive form) with the power of illusion quickly stole away the nectar. Those who opposed the imperishable, supreme purusha, Visnu, in the battle were crushed by all powerful Visnu. In that great and terrible battle between daityas and devatas, Aditi's sons killed Diti's. Indra, having killed the sons of Diti was happy with the kingdom gained. He ruled the worlds in the company of rishis and celestial singers\".      : Thus ends the fortyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Rama! afflicted with great grief when her sons were killed, Diti said to her husband Kasyapa, son of Maricha: \"O adorable one, your highly powerful sons, (devatas) have killed mine through extensive austerities. I am desirous of obtaining a (mighty) son capable of killing Indra. I shall practise austerities. You ought to grant me a son who would be the supreme ruler of the world and capable of killing Indra. You can say yes (if you will)\". Then, Maricha's son, exceedingly bright Kasyapa on hearing the words of Diti who was deeply grieved replied: \"O one vested with the wealth of austerities be it so. Prosperity to you Remain chaste, you will deliver a son who will kill Indra in the battle. \"If you remain pure and clean, on completion of a thousand years you will give birth to a son through me who will be the lord of the three worlds\". Highly brilliant Kasyapa, having thus spoken, touched her gently with his palm, stroked her body and said, \"May good betide thee\". Having said this, Kasyapa went away to perform austerities. \"O foremost among men after Kasyapa had left, Diti exceedingly delighted (at the prospect of having sons) reached Kushaplavana, and practised intense mortifications. O foremost of men great treasure of virtues while she was practising austerities, the thousandeyed Indra  began to serve her. The thousandeyed Indra served her by providing fire, Kusha grass, sticks for burning, water, fruits, roots and all other things desired by her. Indra attended on Diti, stroking her limbs gently from time to time to help her regain their  suppleness and alleviate her fatigue. O son of the Raghus ten years before completion of a thousand years. Diti, highly pleased with the services rendered by Indra, addressed him\", saying: \"O best of the gods your illustrious father granted me a boon for a son I sought on completion of a thousand years (of penance). O the best of the brave ten years is yet to go (for completion of austerities). You will  have a brother. May you prosper O Child I'll create in him eagerness victory. Together with him you will gain victory over the three worlds. Relieved of sorrows, enjoy you'll with him\". After speaking thus to Indra, goddess Diti overpowered with sleep around midsday dropped off, her feet towards her head. Indra laughed. He rejoiced at the sight of her ominous posture of sleeping with her feet towards her head and her hair falling on her feet. O Rama with great courage Indra entered her womb and severed her embryo into  seven pieces. O Rama that embryo, being severed by Vajra having a hundred edges, cried at high pitch which awakened Diti\". Highly powerful Indra, even while saying to the crying embryo  \"Do not weep, Do not weep\" severed it. \"Do not kill\", \"Do not kill\", said Diti. Subsequently Indra, in deference to the words of his mother, emerged out of the womb. Armed with Vajra, Indra addressed Diti with folded palms, saying, \"O Devi you have slept,  with your head towards your feet and your hair falling on your feet\". \"I have seized the opportunity and severed into seven pieces the foetus who would have been a slayer of Indra. O Devi shoudn't you forgive me\"?      : Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Deeply distressed Diti, having come to know that the embryo had been severed into seven pieces, humbly spoke to the unassailable Indra. \"O Indra, Slayer of Balasura, because of my fault this embryo has been made into seven pieces and rendered useless. In this matter you have not committed any fault. This disaster to the embryo has happened contrary to expectations. Hence, I seek a favour from you. Let these seven pieces become seven guardians of marut regions (regions of the wind). O Son, all these seven are my sons of celestial beauty.They will become pesiding deities for Vata Skandha (divisions of wind) and let them be wellknown as maruts wandering in the universe. Among them, one will move about in Brahmaloka, another in Indraloka, and the third, well known as vayu will move around in the sky. O best of devatas by your command the other four sons will remain celestial, and will range about in four directions. The thousandeyed Indra, slayer of Bala, on hearing Diti's words, addressed her with folded palms, saying: \"Everything will, no doubt, happen the way you said. Your sons will wander about as celestial beings. Prosperity to you.\" \"O Rama mother and sons having arrived at this conclusion in the tapovana  ascended to heaven with their desire fulfilled. This is what we have heard.\" \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this is that country which was formerly inhabited by Indra. Here Indra  attended on Diti who achieved the fruit of her austerities. \"O Tiger among men (Rama) this highly virtuous and wellknown son named Vishala was born to Ikshvakus in Alambusa. Where, a city named Vishala was built. \"O Tiger among men (Rama) this highly virtuous and wellknown son named Vishala was born to Ikshvakus in Alambusa. Where, a city named Vishala was built.

By the grace of the Ikshvakus, all the kings of Vishala have been long lived and exalted, valiant and deeply religious. O Rama we shall spend the right happily here. O Best among men On the tomorrow we see Janaka\". Having heard of the arrival of Viswamitra the celebrated Sumati, most brilliant chief of kings proceeded (to receive him). Along with his spiritual preceptors and relatives he paid Viswamitra great respect, enquired his wellbeing and said: \"O Sage no one is more blessed than me since you have favoured me with your arrival in my country.\"      : Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Getting together they enquired one another's health. And then Sumati spoke to the great ascetic (Viswamitra). \"O Sage, wish you well Who are these two youths who seem to possess the  prowess of celestial beings. They walk with the gait of an elephant or a lion. They are courageous like tiger or a bull. Their large eyes are like lotuspetals. They are armed with scimitars, bows and quivers.

They adorn this land like Sun and moon in the sky holding excellent weapons. These heroes have trodden paths difficult to traverse. For what purpose have they come? I want to hear clearly\". On hearing his words, he (Viswamitra) related all about their stay at Siddhashrama and the slaying of rakshasas. After hearing Viswamitra, the king (Sumati) got exceedingly delighted and extended hospitality in accordance with tradition to the highly valiant sons of Dasaratha, the distinguished guests worthy of honour. The descendants of Raghu (Rama and Lakshmana) having received great honour from Sumati, stayed there one night and thereafter set out for Mithila. All the ascetics, having seen that auspicious city of Janaka worshipfully admired Mithila saying, 'Excellent, Excellent' At the sight of an old uninhabited, beautiful and desolate hermitage in a grove near Mithila, the descendant of the Raghus enquired of the foremost among the ascetics (Viswamitra): \"O Venerable one I wish to know why this auspicios looking hermitage was deserted by ascetics? To whom did this belong in the past.\" Eloquent and brilliant Viswamitra, replied to the descendant of the Raghus saying: \"O Descendant of the Raghus I shall tell all you about this hermitage cursed by the wrath of a great man. O Best among men this hermitage resembling a celestial retreat and wellhonoured even by devatas  once belonged to illustrious Gautama. O Highly renowned prince it was here in ancient times that Gautama in the company of Ahalya practised austerities for several years. The thousandeyed Indra, consort of Sachi, having found an opportunity (during the absence of the ascetic), assumed the guise of the ascetic (Gautama) and said to Ahalya: 'O most beautiful one those overtaken by passion would not await the completion of the menstrual period (favourable for copulation). O woman of fine waist I desire union with you.' O Delight of the Raghus the evilintentioned Ahalya, inclined towards the king of the celestials and  knowing him to be the thousandeyed Indra in the guise of the ascetic, consented for the union. O Foremost of men with her heart's desire fulfilled, Ahalya said: \"O Chief of the celestials I'm satisfied. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of cthe gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects.\" O Foremost of men with her heart's desire fulfilled, Ahalya said: \"O Chief of the celestials I'm satisfied. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of cthe gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects.\" Indra smilingly said to Ahalya, 'O One with lovely hips, I am  gratified. I shall go away the way I have come'. O Rama he (Indra) came out of the leafhut quickly after his union with her, apprehensive of Gautama. Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut. Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut. On seeing him, the face of the Lord of the gods (Indra) turned pale with fear. Having seen the wicked Indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic the gentle sage Gautama got enraged and said: \"O Wicked natured one assuming my form you have done a forbidden act. For that reason you shall be devoid of  scrotum. Cursed thus out of anger by eminent Gautama the  testicles of Indra immediately dropped down on the earth. Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: 'You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama'. Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: 'You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama'. 'When the son of Dasaratha, the unassailable Rama enters this dreadful forest, you will be cleansed (of this sin)'. 'O Wickednatured one by offering hospitality to Rama, without covetousness and passion, you will happily live with me by regaining your present form'. \"Highly powerful Gautama who had performed rigid austerities thus cursed the wicked Ahalya and left this hermitage, for the peaks of Himavat mountain served by siddhas and charanas. Here he performed austerities\"(said Viswamitra).      : Thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Deprived of testicles, Indra with a frightened face addressed hordes of rishis and charanas with agni in the forefront. 'I have accomplished the objective of the devatas by creating obstacles to Gautama's  austerities, evoking in consequence the wrath of the magnanimous sage'. 'By his (Gautama's) wrath I have been deprived of my testicles. She (Ahalya) has  been deserted by him. He has lost his ascetic energy through the pronouncement of this great curse'. 'For that reason, O rishis, charanas and great devatas it is your duty to restore my testicles for the benefit I have given you'. 'Hearing Indra, all the devatas accompanied by maruts. Lead by the Firegod devatas approached and said': 'This ram (which has received the share of your sacrificial offerings) has testicles. As Indra has been deprived of his own take these testicles immediately and graft them on to Indra'. Hearing the words of the Firegod the pitrudevatas assembled, uprooted the testicles of the ram and grafted them on to Indra. \"O Son of the Kakutsthas from then on the pitrudevatas have been accepting rams  without testicles as offerings in a sacrifice, with ram's testicles fitted on to Indra. O Son of the Raghus illustrious Gautama's power of ascetism was such that thenceforth Indra possessed the testicles of a ram. \"Most brilliant Rama therefore enter the hermitage of the pious (Gautama) and liberate  this fortunate Ahalya of divine appearance (from the curse).\" In response to the words of Viswamitra Rama and Lakshmana entered the  hermitage, Viswamitra in front. Rama beheld the highly fortunate Ahalya, shining brilliantly with the power of her asceticism. She could not be seen even by men, suras or asuras joined together. She looked  divine and illusory as if created with special efforts by Brahma. Though not clearly visible, she was shining bright like the light of the full Moon muffled by mists in the sky and like the inviolable light of the Sun reflected in the water.

By the words of Gautama, she became invisible to the three worlds till the appearance of Rama. With the expiry of the period of the curse, the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) speared and she became perceptible when Rama touched her feet.

On seeing Ahalya, her body purified by the power of penance at Gautama's command, the devatas worshipfully exclaimed, 'Excellent, Excellent' Brilliant Gautam, the great ascetic, along with Ahalya, worshipped Rama  according to tradition, with delight and continued with his austerities.

                "Rama accompanied by Lakshmana with Viswamitra ahead proceeded in northeasterly direction and reached the sacrificial ground. Rama with Lakshmana told the tiger among ascetics Viswamitra that the preparations or the sacrifice by the illustrious king Janaka were excellent. O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay. O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay. Great ascetic Viswamitra, hearing Rama's words, chose a nottoocrowded place near a watersource for encampment. When the king heard of the arrival of Viswamitra he went forward with Satananda, the blemishless family priest walking ahead in order to welcome him with humility. Eminent officiating priests speedily brought the offerings of worship and paid obeisance to Viswamitra with prayers. Viswamitra received illustrious king Janaka's worship and enquired about the welfare of the king and the conduct of the sacrifice. Viswamitra duly enquired the wellbeing of the sages and the spiritual teachers, priests in right order. And thereafter the rest joined them in great delight. The king then folded his hands in supplication to the foremost of ascetics, Viswamitra, saying \"O Venerable one please be seated along with the eminent ascetics.\" In response to Janaka's words, great sage Viswamitra occupied his seat. Thereafter the family priests, officiationg priests of the sacrifice, counsellors and also the king occupied their seats according to their rank. Thereafter the king looked on all sides and  saw all of them seated  according to their rank and addressed Viswamitra saying: \"Today my sacrifice has been rendered fruitful by the devatas. I have reaped the fruit of my sacrifice today by your venerable presence. O Preeminent among ascetics O brahmana you have come to my sacrificial mandap along with these ascetics Blessed am I Obliged am I. O Brahmarshi learned men say, only twelve days remain for completion of this acrifice. Thereafter O Viswamitra you should see devatas claiming their shares\". Having said this, the king (Janaka) with a cheerful countenance and saluting with folded palms again asked that tiger among ascetics (Viswamitra): \"O Sage (Viswamitra), be blessed.

The son of Gadhi said to Vasishta, \"O Preeminent among sages, be it so, O venerable one they will be done\". Vasishta who was highly brilliant the greatest among those who meditate (on Brahman) and free from sins was pleased. Thereafter he called the speckled cow (Kamadhenu): \"O Sabala, come on quick Listen to my words. I have decided to honour this royal saint and his army with excellent food. Make necessary arrangemets. O Kamadhenu quickly entertain them for my sake with the food of six kinds of tastes (varieties of rich dishes) as desired by each. O Sabala create at once all food items consisting of liquids and solids for drinking, tasting and siping.\"      : Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Destroyer of foes (Rama)\" addressed thus by Vasishta the wishfulfilling Sabala satisfied each one's  desires. Sugarcane, honey and fried grain, invigorating liquors in good containers, excellent drinks and varieties of food (were served). Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed). Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed). \"O Rama, Vasistha entertained everybody in Viswamitra's army to their full satisfaction. They were all wellfed and happy. King Viswamitra along with ladies, priests and brahmins including the royal sage were fully satisfied and delighted. Having received the hospitality along with his counsellors, ministers and attendants, Viswamitra, filled with great delight, said to Vasishta\": \"O Brahman you are worthy of worship. I was received with reverence and wellentertained by you. O Sage conversant with speech listen. \"I shall give you a hundred thousand cows in exchange for Sabala. O Respectable one this cow is a gem. A king (along) has a right on jewels, O Brahmin, for that reason, Sabala rightfully belongs to me. Therefore, give this cow\". Addressed the by Viswamitra venerable and righteous Vasishta who was of the earth  ascetic replied: \"O King I shall not exchange Sabala for a hundred thousand for even or a hundred crore cows or heaps of silver. O Suppressor of enemies Viswamitra it is not proper to separate this cow from me. The relationship between Sabala and me is permanent like the relationship between a  righteous man and his fame. For havyam (oblations to gods) and kavyam (oblations to ancestors), for fulfilling the necessities of life, maintenance of the sacred fire and offering oblations to all spirits of created beings, and for offerings made to the Firegod I depend on this cow. O Royal saint swaha and vashat and various branches of learning are all dependent on this cow. No doubt about it. This one is truly my whole possession, it always gives me contentment. O King for various reasons, I will not give Sabala to you\". To there words of Vasishta, Viswamitra who is skilful in conversation reacted with extreme excitement: \"I shall give fourteen thousand elephants with gold trappings around the neck and girth,  and with goads made of gold. I shall give you eight hundred chariots made of gold and decorated with small tinkling bells, each chariot yoked with four white horses. O Maharshi of auspicious vows I shall give you eleven thousand mighty horses of good breed born in good countries. I shall give one crore young cows of various colours. Give me Sabala. O Best of brahmins I shall offer you jewels or gold as much as you desire. I shall give you everything. Give this Sabala to me\". To these words of sagacious Viswamitra the adorable Vasishta replied: \"O King I shall not give Sabala.\" \"This is verily my jewel, my wealth my very life. This is allinall for me. O King verily this Sabala is useful for my darsa and purnamasa sacrifices, for appropriate gifts and various rites. O King this (cow) is undoubtedly the source of all my actions. Why these useless words? I will never give this wishfulfilling cow\".      : Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Rama when sage Vasishta did not consent to part with the wishfulfilling cow, Viswamitra dragged Sabala by force. O Rama when she was being taken away by the powerful king the distressed Sabala thus reflected choked with sorrow\": \"I am being carried away by attendants of the king in this greatly distressed and pitiable condition. Have I been abandoned by the magnanimous Vasishta? What harm have I done to the pious maharshi, a compassionate soul? Why does he  forsake me, his auspicious one, despite my innocence and devotion\"? \"O Destroyer of enemies thus thinking and repeatedly sighing, that cow shook off those attendants who were in hundreds and ran towards the feet of the illustrious Vasishta with the speed of the wind. Lowing and moaning, standing before Vasishta, roaring like thunder and of kettledrum, Sabala said: \"O Brahma's son O Venerable one you have abandoned me? For what reason the servants of the king are taking me away from you\"? Addressed thus, Bramharshi said to Sabala, like to  a sister whose heart is afflicted with sorrow: \"O Sabala I am not forsaking you. You have done me no harm. This highly powerful king is forcibly carrying you away from me. I am no match for his strength, especially he is a king. Being king, he is a warrior, powerful and lord of the earth. He has an entire akshauhini composed of horses, chariots, elephants and banners. Hence he is stonger\". To these words of  brahmarshi Vasishta armed with immeasurable power, Sabala, who knew the use of words, replied with humility: \"O Best of brahmins it is held that the strength of a kshatriya is no greater than a brahmin's. A brahmin possesses great strength his strength is divine. It is greater than that of a kshatriya. Your power is immeasurable. Even though highly valiant, Viswamitra is not greater than you in strength. Your power is unequalled. O Highly fortunate one I am possessed of your brahminic power. Command me. I will destroy the insolent and power of that wickedminded one. O Rama to this, glorious Vasishta replied: \"Create an army capable of crushing the enemy power. Hearing his words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama her lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while he looked on helplessly. Hearing his words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama her lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while he looked on helplessly. Thereafter the king (Viswamitra), having seen his army thus routed, flew into a fury. Wideeyed with anger, he sat in his chariot and destoyed the Paplavas with various kinds of weapons. Having seen hundreds of Paplavas crushed by Viswamitra, once again she created out of anger. Sakas mixed with Yavanas. Sakas mixed with Yavanas, resembling golden filaments possessing brilliance and supreme bravery, covered the earth. Sakas and Yavanas, armed with swords and lances, clad in yellow apparel, looking  like flaming fire destroyed the entire army. Thereafter, most brilliant Viswamitra released weapons. With these weapons, the Yavanas, Kambhojas and Paplavas were scattered\".      : Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, Vasishta having seen the forces tortured and overpowered by the weapons of Viswamitra said, \"O Kamadhenu create additional forces through your yogic power.\" \"From her lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from the udder Paplavas, weapons in  hand, from the vagina Yavanas, from the anus Sakas, from the roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born. \"From her lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from the udder Paplavas, weapons in  hand, from the vagina Yavanas, from the anus Sakas, from the roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born. O descendant of the Raghus, Viswamitra's army consisting of infantry, elephants, horses, chariots has been entirely destroyed by them instantly. Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced them to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth) Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced them to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth) Then one hundred sons of Viswamitra together with their horses, chariots and foot soldiers were reduced to ashes in a moment by the powerful Vasishta. Seeing his sons and army destroyed the illustrious Viswamitra was filled with shame and anxiety. Like the ocean without waves or the snake bereft of fangs or the Sun eclipsed by Rahu, suddenly (Viswamitra) looked cheerless and dull. Having lost his sons and the army, like a bird with wings clipped, wretched, with pride vanished and confidence shattered Viswamitra fell into despondency. Viswamitra, having entrusted one of his remaining sons to rule the kingdom in accordance with the kshatriya tradition reached the forest. Mighty ascetic Viswamitra, reached the slopes of the Himavat mountain inhabited by kinnaras and uragas (serpents) and performed  austerities in order to propitiate lord Mahadeva. After some time, lord of the gods, bestower of boons, Maheswara with the symbol of the bull on the banner  appeared before mighty Viswamitra. O King what are you performing the penance for? Tell me what you want? I am bestower of boons. Speak out you desire (said Lord Siva). Having heard this from the god, Viswamitra who performed the great austerities prostrated before Mahadeva and said these words. O Irreproachable one O Mahadeva if you are pleased with me, make me an expert in Dhanurveda, the science of archery with all it secrets, angas (branches), upangas (subdivisions) and Upanishads. O Irreproachable one whatever weapons are known to devatas, danavas, maharshis, gandharvas, yakshas, rakshasas, be revealed to me. O Lord of the gods by your favour let my desire be fulfilled. Lord Mahadeva having said: 'Be it so' vanished. Rajarshi Viswamitra endowed with supreme power became very haughty. Having obtained the weapons, his insolence was greatly accentuated. Like the sea during the full moon, with his increased power (blessed with the invincible strength of the weapons) Viswamitra thought the foremost of ascetics Vasishta was (already) slain. (It shows the height of the king's ignorance and arrogance). Thereafter king Viswamitra having proceeded towards the hermitage (of Vasishta) and released the weapons by the energy of which the entire forest of the ascetics was burnt down. On seeing the weapons discharged by the intelligent Viswamitra saints in hundreds fled in all directions. The disciples of Vasishta as well as animals and birds got terrified by the fear and fled in their thousands in all directions. The greatsoul Vasishta's hermitage became deserted and silent in an instant like a barren field. Even while Vasistha was repeatedly  assuring  the saints saying \"Do not fear, I will now destroy Viswamitra, son of Gadhi just as the Sun dispels the morning mist (they fled)\". The infuriated Vasishta who was highly brilliant, foremost among those who meditate said to Viswamitra: \"O Fool this hermitage has been developed over a long time. Why did you destroy it?  On account of your wickedness you will not live long.\" Exceedingly furious Vasishta quickly lifted up his staff which looked like the staff of Yama (the od of death), like smokeless fire at the time of destruction of the worlds.      : Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus said Vasishta. Mighty Viswamitra lifted up agneya astra (shaft of fire) and discharging it said, 'stay, stay'. Venerable Vasishta, in fury lifted the Brahmadanda which was like another rod of death. And spoke these words: \"O wicked kshatriya O son of Gadhi here I stand. Show me your strength and the pride of your arms. I will destroy them now. O mean kshatriya where does your energy of a kshatriya stand in comparison with the great energy of Brahma? Behold my Brahmabala (Brahman's energy)\". The Brahmadanda (released by Vasishta) put down the dreadful agneya astra released by Gadhi's son just like the force of fire is extinguished by water. The incensed son of Gadhi employed varuna, raudra, aindra, pasupata and aishika  weapons. \"O Descendent of Raghu Viswamitra employed weapons like manava, mohana, gandharva, swapana, jrimbhana, madana, santapana, vilapana, shoshana, darana, vajra weapons, Brahma, kala and varuna pasas, the favourite painaka, daita, shushka, ardra vajras, danda, paisacha, krauncha, weapons, dharmachakra, kalachakra, vishnuchakras, vayavya, mathana, hayasira weapons, kanakala, musala powers, vaidyadhara, kalatrishula, kapala, kankana weapons discharged against Vasishta the best of ascetics.

'O Brahman great ascetic Viswamitra was controlled by you. O Best of ascetics be pleased and let the worlds be delivered from distress'. At this, Vasishta the most brilliant ascetic became quiet. The humiliated Viswamitra heaved a sigh and spoke these words: Shame Where is the might of a kshatriya? The energy of a brahmin is the real  energy. The staff of Brahma has singly destroyed all my weapons\". \"Now I have realised the reason.

After some time, four sons, Havishyanda, Madhushyanda, Drudhanetra and Maharatha, who (later) wer wedded to truth and duty, were born.\" A thousand years passed. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahma, appeared. He spoke to Viswamitra, the great ascetic, these pleasant words: \"O Son of Kushika with your austerities you have won the worlds of the rajarshis. On account of your austerities, you are acknowledged a rajarshi\". Having said this the glorious (Brahma), supreme lord of the worlds, left for his abode in Brahmaloka, in heaven accompanied by the gods. On hearing this Viswamitra hanging down his face a little with shame and anger and grief said: \"I have performed intense austerities. Yet rishis and devatas have recognised me only as a rajarshi. I think my penance has yielded fruit. \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this celebrated intellectual having decided in his mind once again performed greater austerities. At this time there lived a celebrated king, renowned in the Ikshvakus race, named Trisanku, who was truthful and self restrained. \"O Son of the Raghus (Rama) a thought arose in his mind to enter heaven with his physical body by performing a sacrifice. Summoning Vasishta he (Trisahnku) communicated his intention, but the great Vasishta said it was not possible. Refused by Vasishta, the king went south in order to fulfil his purpose and approached Vasishta's sons. Most brilliant Trisanku approached the sons of Vasishta in the place where they  had been performing austerities for a long time. There he saw the famous, exceedingly effulgent sons of Vasishta one hundred in number practising penance. The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of his spiritual guide, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority. Bowing down his face in humility and with folded palms, he addressed all those distinguished sons of Vasishta saying: The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of his spiritual guide, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority.

You, brahmins are established in austerity. I bow to you. I beg all of you to direct me with composed minds to direct me in order to attain heaven in physical form'. O Ascetocs after having been rejected by Vasishta. I do not see any way other than the sons of my spiritual guide to help me achieve my purpose.

                "\"O Rama to these words of king Trisanku, the hundred sons of the sage angrily reacted: 'O Evilminded one having been refused by the Guru true to his word, how could you bypass him and approach us who are mere off shoots (of the main). For all the kings of the Ikshvakus race, their chief priest is their Guru. It is not possible to bypass the spiritual preceptor who is true to his word preceptor. When an adorable sage like Vasishta has already said, it is not possible, how can we help you conduct such a sacrifice? O Best one among men you are childish. Return to your capital. O Monarch the most venerable Vasishta is capable of conducting sacrifices performed by anybody in the three worlds. How can we dishonour him'? Having heard the confused words uttered by the sages in a state of anger, the king said again: \"O Men endowed with the wealth of asceticism I was rejected by my guru and now by his sons. I shall seek another way. Farewell to you\". Having seen his fierce intent, the saint's sons were infuriated. They cursed him saying, \"Be a Chandala\" With this the highsouled sons of Vasishta entered their hermitage. And one night after the king became a Chandala (a lowcaste man). The king was tranformed into a darkcomplexioned dirty man with dishevelled hair. His body was besmeared with ashes and on his robes lay wreath collected from the cemetery. He had on him dark (soiled) clothes, and ornaments made of iron. \"O Rama seeing him in the form of a chandala, all his counsellors, inhabitants of the city including his followers fled away. O Descendant of Kakustha wandering alone burning with distress night and day the king went to Viswamitra who was rich in asceticism. O Rama on seeing the king reduced to a useless a chandala, sage Viswamitra was touched with pity\". Exceedingly energetic and deeply pious, he looked at the king who was frightful in appearance and addressed him with compassion saying, \"welfare to you\". \"O Mighty prince what brings your here, for you are the heroic lord of Ayodhya? Whose curse turned you into a chandala\"? In response to his words the king,  who had fallen into the state of a chandala yet proficient in expression, spoke to one (Viswamitra) expert in speech, with folded hands. \"Rejected by my guru and his sons, what I achieved was disaster and what I could not was the fulfilment of my wish. O Gentle sage it is my intention to enter heaven with my physical body. I performed a hundred sacrifices but  did not reap its fruit. O Gentle sage I have never told a lie in spite of troubled circumstances, I shall never dabble in falsehood. I swear upon it by kshatriya morality . I have performed various sacirifices and ruled over my people guided by the law of righteousness. I have pleased eminent elders with my conduct and character. O Preeminent among sages I endeavour to do my duty. I intend to perform a sacrifice. My gurus do not appreciate this. I consider destiny to be allpowerful. The effort of a man goes in vain. Everything is controlled by destiny. It is the supreme resort. My merits have been destroyed by destiny. Deeply afflicted, I crave a favour from you. You are fit to grant it. Wish you well I will not take refuge in anybody. There is no other protector for me.

                "What the king said was proved by his chandala form which the son of Kushika (Viswamitra) heard and out of compassion spoke these sweet words: \"O Descendant of Ikshvakus, O child, welcome. I know you as highly righteous. O eminent among kings fear not. I offer you refuge. O king I shall invite pious maharshis to assist you in the sacrifice which you will be able to perform with great relief. With the present physical body disfigured by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, you shall go to heaven. O King since you have taken refuge in Viswamitra who is the protector of those who resort to him, I think heaven is already within your reach\". Most brilliant Viswamitra having thus spoken, ordered his deeply religious and highly learned sons to make preparations for the sacrifice. He summoned all his disciples, and said, \"Children bring here hosts of rishis along with their disciples and friends, officiating priests and persons wellversed in the Srutis. This is my order. If any one should speak with disrespect in response to my order, you may report the matter to me in full\". At his command the disciples set out in different directions. And as a result, expounders of the vedas began arriving from various countries. All the disciples on their return, communicated to the sage shining in splendour what the expounders of the vedas had said. Having heard your words, all brahmins except Mahodaya have arrived from all countries. O Preeminent among ascetics Here is what the hundred sons of Vasishta spoke in anger. When a kshatriya acts as a priest for the sacrifice, particularly for a chandala, how can gods and sages partake the offerings? Joining Viswamitra, (in chanting the mantras during the yaga) how will the great brahmins attain heaven after partaking the food offered by of Chandala? O Best among ascetics all the sons of Vasishta along with Mahodaya with their eyes reddened in anger spoke these harsh words\": On hearing the words (of the hundred sons of Vasishta uttered in anger) Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, spoke furiously with eyes reddened in anger. \"I am blameless. I have practised rigorous penance. These wicked ones who have abused (a sage like me) will be reduced to ashes. Caught by the noose of death this day, they shall be brought  to the abode of Yama  and for seven hundred births, feed on corpses. Reborn as the merciless race of mushtikas, feeding on the flesh of dogs, hideous and deformed, they shall wander in these worlds. The wicked Mahodaya, who blamed a sage like me so faultless shall be reborn in the race of the nishadas vulnerable to abuse by all. As a consequence of my anger that Mahodaya, devoid of mercy and  taking pleasure in depriving others of their life, will pursue a wretched life for a long time\". The most powerful sage Viswamitra of fierce asceticism fell silent after after uttering this curse in the assembly of rishis.      : Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The most brilliant Viswamitra, having destroyed the sons of Vasishta including Mahodaya by his ascetic power, said this in the midst of saints: \"This religious and generous king born in the Ikshvaku race, wellknown as Trisanku sought my refuge to gain heaven with his physical body, Join me in the performance of this sacrifice in a manner by which he (Trisanku) attains  heaven with his physical body\". Agreeing to these words of Viswamitra all the rishis, knowers of spiritual order and endowed with righteousness assembled there said: \"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever he says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. He will curse us if angered. \"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever he says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. He will curse us if angered. Hence let the sacrifice be performed in such a manner that the descendant of the Ikshvakus would attain heaven with his physical body through the spiritual power of Viswamitra. All of you commence the sacrifice\". The maharshis having resolved performed their respective activities relating to the sacrifice. The brilliant Viswamitra acted as the chief officiating priest. The officiating priests proficient in chanting mantras performed in order of their respective ranks all the rites in accordance with the Yojanakalpa adhering to codes and traditions. Long after, the mighty ascetic Viswamitra  invoked all the gods to partake their share of offerings. When, the gods invited by him did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku: When, the gods invited by him did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku: \"O King behold the prowess of my selfearned asceticism. With my spiritual might, I shall send you to heaven with your physical body O King go to heaven with physical body which is not possible for anybody to accomplish. By the power of what little fruit of austerities I have earned, I shall send to heaven with your body\". \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) when the sage had said these words, the king with his physical body ascended to heaven in the presence of the sages. On ascending to heaven Trisanku saw Indra (destroyer of Paka) along with hosts of  gods. Indra said to him: \"O Trisanku you are not fit to inhabit heaven. Go back, you fool Doomed by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, fall on earth, head down. Thus spoken to by Indra, Trisanku crying, \"O Viswamitra, Protect me, Protect me\" started falling down. Having heard the wailing Trisanku, the enraged Viswamitra shouted, \"Stay, Stay\". Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that  mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma. Overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction. Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that  mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma.

The son of Kushika (Viswamitra), the preeminent ascetic heard the gods and said these praiseworthy words: \"I wish you well Having promised king Trisanku ascent to heaven with his  physical form, I do not wish to go back on my word. Let this heaven be an eternal abode for Trisanku in his physical form All these stars created by me shall endure as long as the worlds survive. O gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this\". Let this heaven be an eternal abode for Trisanku in his physical form All these stars created by me shall endure as long as the worlds survive. O gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this\".

Those many celebrated stars shall stay on all sides outside the path of Vaisvanara (zodiac) in the firmament. Amidst those stars, Trisanku, shining brilliantly like an immortal, shall stay on, head down\". Thus addressed, all the gods, replied to the preeminent ascetic, \"O Best among sages, be blessed let thy will be donel. Those many celebrated stars shall stay on all sides outside the path of Vaisvanara (zodiac) in the firmament. Amidst those stars, Trisanku, shining brilliantly like an immortal, shall stay on, head down\". These stars will follow this illustrious one (Trisanku), the best of kings who gained his object, as if he had attained heaven. In this manner extolled by all devatas and rishis, mighty and righteous Viswamitra said, 'well let it be so'. \"O Best among men (Rama) then at the conclusion of the sacrifice the great gods and saints went the way they had come\".      : Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Tiger among men (Rama) thereafter great Viswamitra seeing the departing sages of the forest said: \"O Highsouled sages, there is lake Pushkara in the vast western region. There in the forest fit for austerities we shall practise penance peacefully\". With this the most powerful sage Viswamitra reached Pushkara where living on fruits and roots, he carried out intense, unsurpassable,  austerities. At this time Ambarisha, a wellknown king of Ayodhya, launched preparations for a  sacrifice. While he was performing the sacrifice Indra stole away the sacrificial animal. The animal could not be traced. Hence the priest said to the king: \"O King the animal has been stolen away and because of your inability to enforce law, it could not be traced. O Lord of men the king who fails to protect (his dependents) perishes by his own faults. \"O Best of men you must pay a big price for this. Bring either the beast or a man immediately so that the sacrifice can be completed\". \"O Best of men (Rama) hearing the words of the high priest, the highly intellectual king searched for a human victim in exchange for thousands of cows. O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till he saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with his sons and wie. O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till he saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with his sons and wie. The most brilliant king(Ambarisha) bowing to sage Richika, a brahmarshi who looked extremely resplendent with penance, propitiated him, enquired about the welfare of all and finally said\": \"O Fortunate descendent of the Bhrigu race if your son is sold as a sacrificial animal in exchange for a hundred thousand cows, my purpose will be answered. I have roamed all countries but could not final the sacrificial animal. Should'nt you spare one of your sons for a price\"? Thus addressed the exceedingly brilliant Richika said, \"O Best among men in no way shall I sell my first born\". Having heard Richika, the miserable mother of great sons, addressed Ambarisha, the foremost of men, saying: Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. \"O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son\". Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. \"O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son\". \"O Best among men generally, the eldest sons are the favourites of their fathers, the youngest their mothers: For that reason, I shall keep my youngest son. O Rama the sage and his wife having spoken thus, their middle son Sunassepha said on his own: O King my father says his eldest son cannot be sold, mother says that her  youngest son cannot be spared. From this I think middle son is already sold away. Therefore, take me\" \"O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) having purchased Sunassepha for a hundred thousands of cows the king refurned immensely pleased.",
                "O Foremost of men, O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) the illustrious king (Ambarisha) took Sunassepha with him. (On the way) at Pushkara he took some rest at noon. While the king was resting at Pushkara, the famous Sunassepha, very much distressed, happened to see his maternal uncle Viswamitra in the company of other sages performing austerities. With his face discoloured due to thirst and fatigue, he (Sunassepha) immediately fell into the sage's lap in a pitiable condition and said: \"O Noble man O Preeminent among ascetics I have no mother nor father nor friends nor relatives. You should protect me according to dharma. O Best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody. You are promoter of others' welfare. May the king fulfil his purpose. May I live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance. May I enjoy heaven. O Best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody. You are promoter of others' welfare. May the king fulfil his purpose. May I live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance. May I enjoy heaven. O Virtuous one with a kind heart protect this orphan. Like a father who protects his son, save me from this peril\". Having heard Sunassepha, mighty ascetic Viswamitra consoled him in many ways and said to his sons: O sons of the sage this young boy has sought my protection. O Sons you may grant him his desire by merely offering your life. Engaged in the observance of righteousness, all of you have done virtuous deeds. By becoming sacrificial animals for the king, you may satisfy Agni. Then Sunassepha will be protected. The king's sacrifice will continue without hindrance. The gods will be gratified. My words also will come true\". \"O Best of men (Rama) in response to the words of the sage Madhuchanda and others said thus in a casual way with selfesteem. O Lord protecting other's son by abandoning one' own is like partaking the flesh of a dog. We consider it a prohibited act\". On hearing the words of his sons Viswamitra, the eminent ascetic, eyes reddened with anger began to speak: \"(You have) not only trangressed my words but also (you are) censurable according to dharma. You have uttered such audacious and dreadrul words causing the hair to stand on end. All of you shall live on earth for a thousand years, like the sons of Vasishta feeding on the flesh of dogs\". Viswamitra the best of ascetics, thus cursed his sons. Sunassepha, (now) was filled with distress. To relieve him of his pain he said: \"Bedaubing your person with red sandal paste and adorned with red garlands, you will be bound to a Vaishnava, sacrificial post with sacred ropes. There invoke Agni with these hymns. O Son of sage chant thse two sacred mantras in the sacrifice of Ambarisha.There after you will achieve success (long life)\". Sunassepha memorized the two verses with concentration of mind and hastened towards Amabarisha, a lion among kings. And said: \"Endowed with great strength, you are a lion among kings. We shall go to the sacrificial assembly without delay. O Indra among monarchs, take up initiatory rites and  perform the sacrifice\". At the words of the sage's son, the king, eager with delight hastened towards the sacrificial ground. With the consent of the officiating priests the king invested Sunasepha with the sacred symbols with Kusa grass, dressed him in red apparel and tied him to the sacrificial post as a sacrificial animal. Thus bound, the son of the sage praised the two devatas, Indra and Upendra with moving words. \"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) Indra, gratified with the secret hymn granted Sunassepha long life. O Foremost of men O Rama the king also obtained from the sacrifics innumerable rewards by the grace of Indra several times greater than expected. O Best among men the righteous and mighty ascetic Viswamitra also continued his austerities at Pushkara for a thousand years\".      : Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "All the gods wanted to bestow the fruits of austerties on the mighty ascetic (Viswamitra). They approached him after a thousand years of penace and his final ritual bath. Exceedingly effulgent Brahma spoke to him, \"You have become a rishi through the selfearned sacred deeds. Fare you well\". Brahma, the lord of the gods, having said this returned to heaven. The brilliant Viswamitra continues his austerities. \"O Foremost of men after a long lapse of time a chief nymph called Menaka came to bathe at Pushkara. There the most brilliant son of Kusika Viswamitra saw Menaka whose beauty was incomparable. She looked like lightning in the clouds. On seeing her (Menaka) Viswamitra came under the influence of the god of love (fell in love with her). He said, O Apsara welcome to my hermitage stay here. I am infatuated with you: Oblige me. Wish you well. \"O Descendant of Raghu while that woman of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily\". \"O Descendant of Raghu while that woman of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily\". As the period passed, Viswamitra the mighty ascetic was filled with grief, anxiety and remorse. O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) a sense of indignation filled the mind of the ascetic. 'All this is the conspiracy of the gods to deprive me of my great austerities', he thought. Night and day deluded by lust I have wasted ten years. A hindrance has been posed (to my tapas). \"O Rama Viswamitra, the best of ascetics sighed with repentance, distressed with grief. On seeing him, the apsara started trembling in fear. She stood before him with folded palms. (But) with sweet words the son of Kushika left her and proceeded towards the northern mountains. \"O Rama Viswamitra, the best of ascetics sighed with repentance, distressed with grief. On seeing him, the apsara started trembling in fear. She stood before him with folded palms. (But) with sweet words the son of Kushika left her and proceeded towards the northern mountains. Illustrious Viswamitra took a vow of celibacy in order to control his senses. And performed rigid austerities on reaching the bank of river Kausiki. O Rama while he was performing rigorous penance for a thousand years on the northern mountains, the gods were gripped with fear. (lest he should exceed them). After consultations the gods and sages decided that this son of Kushika (Viswamitra)  deserved the status of a Maharshi\". Having heard the gods, the Grandsire of the worlds (Brahma) addressed  Viswamitra whose wealth was his ascetism in these sweet words. \"O Maharshi O Child welcome Pleased with your intense austerities, O Son of Kushika I confer upon you the eminent rank of a great rishi (maharshi)\". Having heard the words Brahman, the lord of all the worlds, Viswamitra whose wealth was his asceticism was neither dejected nor delighted. Then the mighty ascetic Viswamitra bowed to Brahma, the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded hands and replied: \"O Adorable one, if you have conferred the incomparable title of 'Maharshi' earned by my auspicious deeds, I feel I have conquered the senses.\" Then Brahma said to him, 'You have not conquered the senses yet. O Tiger among ascetics, strive still.' Having said this he went toward heaven. After the departure of the gods, mighty ascetic Viswamitra raised his arms up, stood without support, subsisting on air, continuing with his austerities. Viswamitra whose wealth was his penance carried on his rigid austerities for a thousand years amidst five fires, in summer, under the open sky in monsoon, and   immersed in ater night and day in winter. When the mighty asetic Viswamitra was peforming penance, the gods as well as Indra  got deeply perturbed. Indra along with all the maruts spoke to the celestial nymph Rambha, words that augured well for them and not for kaushika (Viswamitra).      : Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Rambha you must entice Viswamitra by lust and passion. This important work must be done by you in the interest of the gods\". O Rama, to these words of the sagacious, thousandeyed Lord of the gods (Indra) that apsara with folded hands bashfully replied: 'Lord of the devatas this mighty ascetic Viswamitra is a terrible person. He will ceratinly release on his dreadful anger (curse me). O Lord this is my apprehension. You should excuse me'. O Rama having heard Rambha trembling in fear and standing with folded palms, Indra spoke: 'O Rambha have no fear. Feel safe. Carry out my order. When the trees look so beautiful in spring I shall in captivating the form of a cuckoo, stay by your side in the company of Kamadeva (Cupid). 'O Rambha have no fear. Feel safe. Carry out my order. When the trees look so beautiful in spring I shall in captivating the form of a cuckoo, stay by your side in the company of Kamadeva (Cupid). O Rambha displaying many (romantic) gestures and assuming a fascinating form, distract the mighty ascetic, Kausika (Viswamitra)'. At these words (of Indra), Rambha, assumed any form of excellent beauty and with a bright smile set out to allure Viswamitra. Excited by the charming warble of the cuckoo, Viswamitra opened his eyes. On hearing the sound of the incomparable song of the cuckoo along with the  sight of Rambha, a doubt arose in the mind of the ascetic. Son of Kushika, the eminent ascetic knew it was the work of Indra. Seized with anger, he cursed Rambha: 'O luckless Rambha, since you have endeavoured to distract me from my desire to conquer  wrath and passion, you shall turn into a rock and remain so for ten thousand years'. 'O Rambha an effulgent brahmin, endowed with the power of asceticism, will liberate you from this state into which you have fallen on account of my anger'. The brilliant Viswamitra, the great ascetic, now experienced remorse for his inability to contain anger. This mighty curse, of the great saint transformed Rambha into a rock and sent Kamadeva and Indra to their heels. \"O Rama highly powerful Viswamitra was deprived of his ascetic merit due to his anger. He had no peace of mind for his inability to control his senses. Having been deprived of his ascetic merit, he resolved not to lose his temper nor ever breathe a word\". \"Further, I shall not even inhale for hundreds of years. I shall conquer my senses and dry up this body. Until brahminhood is obtained by my austerities, I shall stay without breathing or eating for innumerable years. While performing penance, my limbs shall not undergo deterioration\". \"O Descendant of Raghu in this way that eminent ascetic took an unprecedented vow to practise penance for a thousand years\".      : Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Rama thereafter the great ascetic (Viswamitra), abandoning the north of the Himavat mountain reached the eastern quarter and performed rigorous austerities. Having observed a unique vow of silence for a thousand years, O Rama he practised unprecedented and extremely difficult austerities. After completion of a thousand years the great ascetic became a piece of wood. In spite of many impediments, he was unshaken, anger did not enter into his mind. O Rama with firm determination he practised  austerities. O Best of Raghus dynasty (Rama) when the thousandyearold vow was over (Viswamitra) the great practitioner of vows began to partake cooked rice.

Viswamitra went without food but did not utter a single word to the brahmin. Thereafter the distinguished ascetic practised austerities for another period of thousand years, his breath suspended. While his breath, was suspended, smoke emanated from his head which frightened the three worlds. It appeared as though they were on fire. Thereupon devatas along with gandharvas, pannagas, uragas, and rakshasas, stood bewildered by his ascetic energy. Their own glory was dimmed in his lustre\". Afflicted with anguish, they spoke to the Grandsire (Brahma): \"O Lord the great sage Viswamitra was lured and angered in various ways. But his austerities continued to grow: His penance was flawless. If his wishes were not granted, he will  surely destroy by his austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables. His penance was flawless. If his wishes were not granted, he will  surely destroy by his austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables. There is bewilderment everywhere. It is dark all over. The oceans are disturbed. The mountains have cracked. O Brahma the earth trembles. The wind blows fiercely. The people have ceased to believe in God. We do not know the way out. The people of all the three worlds are agitated and confused in mind. The Sun, too, looks pale before the brilliance of the Maharshi. O Lord before this mighty, venerable ascetic, effulgent like fire decides to destroy the three worlds, he should be appeased. All the three worlds are burning as though with the fire Pralaya (dissolution). His desire may be granted even if he wants to rule the kingdom of the gods. Thereafter, with Brahma in the forefront, the gods spoke to Viswamitra in pleasing words: \"Welcome, O Brahmarshi. We are immensely pleased with your austerities. O Kausika you have attained brahminhood by means of your intense penance. O Brahmana I along with the maruts grant you long life. May you prosper O Gentle one now you may go happily\". Mighty ascetic Viswamitra was delighted to hear the words of the Grandsire and the gods. Bowing to all of them he thus spoke: \"If brahminhood and long life have been acquired by me by your grace, Omkara, Vashatkara and the Vedas shall accept me as Brahmarshi. (I shall acquire the right to interpret the Vedas and to perform sacrifices.) \"O gods let the son of Brahma and eminent Vasishta who is knowledgeable in the vedas worthy of brahmins and archery worthy of kshatriyas address me as 'Brahmarshi'. If this supreme desire is granted, O Best of devatas all of you can go\". Thereupon, pleased by the gods, Vasishta, the best among ascetics, lovingly said to Viswamitra \"You are a Brahmarshi, let it be so\". \"You are a Brahmarshi, no doubt. You will achieve ascetic perfection\", said the gods and returned to their respective places from where they had come. Virtuous Viswamitra also, having attained excellent brahminhood, worshipped  Brahmrshi Vasishta who was the best of those who recite hymns\". This illustrious sage having fulfilled his desire, wandered over the earth fixed in asceticism. O Rama  thus he acquired brahminhood. O Rama he is the foremost of ascetics, an embodiment of asceticism, always intent on virtue. He is the ultimate repository of ascetic energy\". Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra): Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra): \"O Righteous one O Preeminent among ascetics you have come to my sacrifice accompanied by the descendants of Kakustha (Rama and Lakshmana). I am  blessed by your presence and am   highly favoured. O Excellent ascetic O Brahmana I am sanctified with your presence. I have derived immense benefits from your visit. O powerful  Brahmarshi distinguished Rama and I have heard your great austerities which were related in detail (by Satananda). Many of your virtues have been heard by the members of the assembly present at the  sacrifice. Your austerities are immeasurable, your power is immense. O Son of Kushika (Viswamitra), your virtues cannot be measured. O Lord I am never tired of listening to your marvellous deeds. O Excellent among ascetics the Sun has set and it is time for evening prayers. O Sage of great austerities come to me tomorrow at dawn. O Excellent ascetic welcome And allow me to leave\".",
                "The day dawned bright and clear when the king (Janaka) performed his daily routine rites and welcomed the great Viswamitra with the two Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana). The virtuous Janaka paid respects to Viswamitra and the highsouled Rama and Lakshmana in accordance with the sastras and spoke: \"Welcome, O Venerable one O Irreproachable one what can I do for you? Worthy of being commanded, I seek your orders. At the words of the magnanimous Janaka, the virtuous sage wellversed in speech replied to the heroic king: Dasaratha's sons, (Rama and Lakshmana), kshatriyas renowned in the world are eager to see that great bow in your possession. Be blessed. Show this great bow to the princes. This is their desire. Once it is fulfilled, they will go back. Thus addressed by the mighty ascetic Janaka replied, \"I shall tell you how this bow came to be deposited here\". \"O Adorable one there was a famous king named Devarata, sixth in line from Nimi. This bow was kept with him in trust by the exalted lord (Shiva). Earlier at the time of destruction of Daksha's sacrifice, Rudra endowed with  great prowess lifted this bow sportively and spoke to the gods. 'O gods in your anxiety to partake your share of the sacrifie, you have failed to provide mine in the sacrificial offerings. Therefore, I shall sever your jewelled heads and beautiful limbs with this bow'. \"O Eminent ascetic thereafter all the gods with agitated minds propitiated lord of the gods, Siva and he was pleased with them. O Lord that gem of a bow belonging to Siva was given to the great gods who in turn got it deposited in trust with our ancestor. Thereupon while I was ploughing and cleaing the (sacrificial) ground, Sita, a wellknown name, was lifted up by the blade of the plough. Thus she was obtained by me. Arisen from the earth and not from a mother's womb, she grew up as my daughter. I made a stipulation that (this shall be the means to win this maiden as a gift) this shall be given in marriage only to the prince whose prowess is fully tried. O Eminent ascetic arisen from the earth and reared as my daughter, she has been sought after in marriage by many princes. O Worshipful one all those monarchs sought this maiden but I did not offer my daughter saying that the 'marriage offer' could be made only through the tried and tested prowess of a suitor. O Preeminent among ascetics thereafter many kings together came to Mithila to test their prowess. The bow was brought and placed before those who were curious to test their strength but none was able to grasp or lift the bow. O great ascetic I knew those mighty kings had little strength, so rejected them. O Mighty ascetic, thereafter all the kings doubting their own strength in stringing the bow were inflamed with anger and laid siege on Mithila. Those eminent kings felt humiliated. Inflamed with anger, they tormented the city of Mithila. O Best among ascetics thus one year passed. Everywhere in the city all the means of living were exhausted. I felt deeply sad over this situation. Thereafter, I propitiated the gods by my austerities. Highly pleased, they gave me an army of four divisions (chariots, elephants, horses and infantry ). Then those wicked kings who were exhausted were doubtful about their energy. They were beaten and defeated. They fled away along with their ministers in different directions. O Sage you are a tiger among asceties, you are faithful to your vows, I shall show this effulgent bow to your Rama and Lakshmana . O Sage if Rama could lift and string this bow I shall give my daughter Sita, not born from a woman, to him (son of Dasaratha)\".      : Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "At the words of Janaka, great ascetic Viswamitra said to the king, \"Let the bow be shown to Rama\". Thereafter king Janaka said to his feudatories, \"Let the divine bow adorned with flowers and sandalpaste be brought\". Commanded by (king) Janaka, the ministers went to the city, put the bow in front of them and carried it as per the orders of the king. Five thousand mighty stalwarts drew with great difficulty the eightwheeled cart on which the bow was placed in a box. The counsellors of the king, brought the iron casket containing the bow and said these words to Janaka comparable to a celestial: 'O Indra among kings O lord of Mithila here is the great bow, worshipped by all kings, which you intend to show (to Rama)'. Having heard this, the king with folded hands said to the great soul Viswamitra sitting with the two princes Rama and Lakshmana: \"O Brahman in the olden days, this great bow was worshipped by my forefathers. Powerful kings failed to string this bow. Hosts of devatas, asuras, rakhasas, kinnaras and great serpents, the best of gandharvas and yakshas, also failed (to wield this bow). How then can men bend, string, fix the arrow, pull the string and lift it? O Eminent ascetic such heaviest bow is brought here, O Highly accomplished sage show this to the two princes\". Having heard the words of Janaka, the righteous Viswamitra said: \"O Child O Descendant of Raghu look at this bow\". At the words of the great rishi Viswamitra, Rama opened the casket, beheld  the bow and said: \"O Brahmarshi, shall I touch this great bow with my hands lift and string it\". The king as also the rishi said \"Be it so\". At the words of the sage (Viswamitra), he (Rama) took hold of the bow by the its middle with ease: Virtuous Rama, the delight of the Raghus, in the presence of several thousands of men fixed the string to the bow and drew it as though with ease. Rama, the best among men, righteous and famous lifted the bow. Stringing it with a twang he drew it and broke it into two in the middle. It generated a loud sound like the clap of thunder, like the trembling of the earth and the splitting of a mountain. On hearing the sound, except Janaka, Viswamitra and the two raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) the rest of the people around fell down and fainted. When the people recovered the king skilful in the use  of words addressed the eminent ascetic  without apprehension with folded palms in the following words: \"O Worshipful one I have witnessed the prowess of Rama, son of Dasaratha. I had not imagined that this marvellous feat could be ever accomplished. By receiving Rama, son of Dasaratha, as her husband, my daughter Sita will bring glory to my dynasty. O Son of Kausika I announce Sita to be the 'Reward of prowess'. My vow has come true. She is more valuable than my life and fit to be given to Rama. O Brahmarshi Kausika, be blessed With your consent my ministers will take the chariots to Ayodhya immediately. That Sita, the reward of prowess is to be given to Rama be reventially communicated in detail to king Dasaratha and he may be conveyed here. The welfare of the descendant of Kausika (Rama and Lakshmana) under the protection of sage (Viswamitra) be reported to the king. The king who will be happy to hear this be brought here by swiftfooted men\". The son of Kausika (Viswamitra) also said, \"So be it\". The virtuous king, having consulted his ministers, despatched counsellors to Ayodhya to communicate to king Dasaratha all that had taken place and bring him (to Mithila).      : Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Commanded by Janaka the messengers travelled for three days, rested for three nights on the way and entered the city of Ayodhya along with their horses tired. Reaching the king's palace the messengers said to the doorkeepers, \"Let king Dasaratha be immediately informed that the messengers from Janaka have come\". Having heard their words, the doorkeepers informed the descendant of Raghu (king Dasaratha). Thereafter, with the the king's permission, the messengers entered the royal palace  and beheld the aged king Dasaratha who shone like a god. All the messengers, hands folded free from apprehensions, reverentially addressed the king in sweet words. \"O Great monarch Mithila's lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection. \"O Great monarch Mithila's lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection. Janaka, the king of Mithila with the enquiry about your welfare, with the permission of the son of Kausika (Viswamitra) sends you this message: O King It is wellknown that formerly I had vowed to give my daughter to a groom as a reward for prowess. Disappointed when proved powerless, the kings became indignant and opposed me. O King that this daughter of mine has been won by your heroic son Rama  who has come here casually led by Viswamitra. O Great king, Dasaratha the divine bow with its limitless glory was broken in the middle by the great self Rama in the assembly of people. Sita is fit to be given in marriage to this eminent Rama as a reward for his prowess. I request you to give your consent to fulfil my vow. O Mighty king be blessed. Come here soon with your preceptors and priest. You ought to be reumitd with Rama amd Lakshmana. O Indra among kings you will not only bring me pleasure, you will also be happy to see your sons. The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra's approval and in line with Satananda's thinking has conveyed these sweet words\". The messengers having said so concluded  out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative). The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra's approval and in line with Satananda's thinking has conveyed these sweet words\". The messengers having said so concluded  out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative). Exceedingly happy to hear the words of the messengers, the king said to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other ministers. \"The enhancer of the joy of Kausalya (Rama) along with hs brother Lakshmana under the protection of  Viswamitra  is now staying in the coutry of the Videhas.\" Illustrious Janaka desires to bestow his daughter on the descendat of Kakustha (Rama) whose prowess he has witnessed. If you approve the action, of the distinguished Janaka, let us hurry to the city of Mithila. Let there be no delay\".",
                "With the passing of the night king Dasaratha, accompanied by spiritual preceptors and relatives said to Sumantra: \"Let all the officers of the treasury furnished with enough wealth and a variety gems go in advance under escort. Let the four divisions of the army from all the four quarters with elegant palanquins proceed at my command. Let brahmins like Vasishta, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kasyapa, Markandeya endowed with long life, and rishi Katyayana depart in advance. My chariot be yoked and kept ready. Let there be no delay.

My chariot be yoked and kept ready. Let there be no delay. The messengers (from Janaka) are hastening me up\". While the Indra among kings (Dasaratha) proceeded with the sages, the four divisions of the army followed them at the command of the king. Covering the distance in four days, they arrived in the country of the Videhas. The fortunate king Janaka, having heard about these tidings, made arangements to extend to them reverential hospitality. King Janaka approached the aged ruler of men, Dasaratha, and experienced great delight. Filled with joy the best of men (Janaka) addreseed the best of men Dasaratha: \"O Descendant of the Raghus, O Great king welcome I am fortunate to have you, you will experience the pleasure of both your sons having won the  reward for their prowess. Most brilliant and adorable ascetic Vasishta surrounded by the foremost of brahmins like Indra by the gods has also arrived by the grace of God. By the grace of god, I have overcome all impediments. By the grace of God my race  has been honoured through alliance with the house of the Raghus distinguished by their valour. O Foremost of men, O Best of kings, tomorrow at dawn after the completion of the sacrifice, you should perform the marriage with approval by the sages\". At these words, the most eloquent king (Dasaratha) made his reply in the midst of sages: \"I have heard that acceptance of a gift from the righteous is a pleasure. So we will act upon your word\". Janaka was filled with extreme admiration to hear one who was truthful, righteous and famous (this Dasaratha). Thereupon hosts of sages in one another's company, filled with great delight spent the night comfortably. The king (Dasaratha) was greatly delighted on being reunited with his sons Rama and Lakshmana. Honoured by Janaka, he spent the night with supreme satisfaction. Mighty philosopher Janaka also performed the  sacrificial rites and spent the night (there where the sacrificial ceremony was performed) with both his daughters.      : Thus ends the sixtynineth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter at dawn after the maharshis had performed their daily (sacrificial) rites the eloquent Janaka said to the chief priest Satananda: \"The extremely righteous, renowned and most brilliant Kusadhwaja, my younger brother is (at present) ruling the sacred kingdom of Sankasya, which is like the aerial chariot Pushpaka, with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious, sacred river Ikshumati. \"The extremely righteous, renowned and most brilliant Kusadhwaja, my younger brother is (at present) ruling the sacred kingdom of Sankasya, which is like the aerial chariot Pushpaka, with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious, sacred river Ikshumati. I desire to see Kusadhwaja who I have accepted as the protector of the sacrifice. I want that my glorious brother should share this pleasure, with me\". Janaka having said so in the presence of Satananda gave instructions to a few faithful  attendants who were present. In obedience to the command of Indra among men (king Janaka), the messengers rode away on swift horses to bring king Kusadhwaja, a tiger among men just like fetching Visnu by the orders of Indra. The messengers reached Sankasya, met Kusadhwaja and related to him what had happened. They informed him the intention of (king) Janaka. Kusadhwaja having heard the events from the loyal, mighty messengers set out for Mithila in compliance with the request of the king (Janaka). There he saw the highsouled Janaka devoted to righteousness. Having paid his regards to Satananda and the virtuous king he occupied an exalted seat befitting a king. The two heroic brothers endowed with great splendour seated beside each other, despatched Sudamana the wisest of ministers (to Dasaratha). \"O Foremost among counsellors, go speedily and bring along with his ministers and sons the invincible Dasaratha of the Ikshvakus dynasty whose splendour is immeasurable\". Having reached the tent, he (Sudamana) saw Dasaratha, perpetuator of the race of the Raghus and bowing down his head, said: \"O Heroic lord of Ayodhya, Janaka, the lord of Mithila desires to see you along with preceptors and priest\". King Dasaratha on hearing the words of the best of the counsellors reached the place where Janaka was waiting with hosts of rishis and relations. The king (Dasaratha), skilled in speech, accompanied by counsellors and kins said to Janaka,the lord of the Videhas: \"O Great king venerable Vasishta is the spiritual protector of the Ikshvakus race and it is known that for all ceremonies he is our spokesman\". \"Having been permitted by Viswamitra, along with all maharshis virtuous Vasishta will tell you in detail about my race\". Having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings, Dasaratha remained silent. Then Vasishta, the venerable sage, wellversed in speech spoke to the Lord of Videhas (Janaka) in the midst of priests. Having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings, Dasaratha remained silent. Then Vasishta, the venerable sage, wellversed in speech spoke to the Lord of Videhas (Janaka) in the midst of priests. \"From the unmanifest was born the eternal, the constant, the imperishable Brahma. To him was born Marichi and to Marichi, Kasyapa. Kasyapa begot Vivasvan and Vivasvan, Manu. Ikshavaku was the son of Manu otherwise called Prajapati or Vaivasvata. It may be noted that Ikshvaku was the first ancestral king of Ayodhya whose son was the wellknown, glorious Kukshi. Prosperous Vikukshi was Kukshi's son, who brought forth brilliant and powerful Bana. Bana's son was the most brilliant and valiant Anaranya whose son Pruthu was succeeded by Trisanku. Trisanku's famous son was Dundumara also known as Yuvanashva whose son was king Mandhata. Mandhata's son was prosperous Susandhi who brought forth two sons Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit. To Dhruvasandhi was born the wellknown Bharata who begot the vigorous Asita. Valiant kings belonging to the races of the Haihayas, Talaiangha, and Sasibindus   became  the enemies to Asita. The king Asita who was a weakling was defeated in the conflict against the kings and was exiled. Along with his counsellors he lived at on the Bhriguprasravana Himavat mountain. It is said that his (Asita's) two wives were pregnant. One gave food mixed with poison to the other with the intention of destroying her embryo. At that time Chyavana of the family of Bhrigu liked to stay at Himavat, the great, pleasant mountain. That the lotuseyed and highly accomplished Kalindi, offered herself for a son to Chyavana who was glowing like a god. Having approached the ascetic. Kalindi paid obeisance to him who said: 'O Great lady a child of high prowess, lustre and virtues is growing in your womb. In a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison (administered to you) will be born. O Lotuseyed lady, do not grieve'. 'O Great lady a child of high prowess, lustre and virtues is growing in your womb. In a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison (administered to you) will be born. O Lotuseyed lady, do not grieve'. This eldest queen who was a devoted wife, afflicted with sorrow due to loss of her husband  gave birth to a son by the grace of  Chyavana. Since poison was given to her by  her rival queen with the intention of destroying the   embryo, the son was born with poison and so came to be known as Sagara. Asamanja was the son of Sagara and to him was born Anshuman. Dilipa was the son of Anshuman and father of Bhagiratha. Bhagiratha begot Kakustha whose son was Raghu. Powerful Pravriddha was Raghu's son. He became Purushadaka (cannibal), on the curse of Vasistha. He grasped water in order to retaliate Vasishta but was prevented by  his wife. The water fell on his feet and he came to be known as Kalmashapada (feet polluted with water). Samkhana was born to him. Sudarsana was the son of Samkhana. His son was Agnivarna. To Agnivarna was  born Sighraga and to Sighraga, Maru. To Maru, was born Prasusruka and to Prasrusuka, Ambarisha. Sudarsana was the son of Samkhana. His son was Agnivarna. To Agnivarna was  born Sighraga and to Sighraga, Maru. To Maru, was born Prasusruka and to Prasrusuka, Ambarisha. King Nahusha was the son of  Ambarisha. To Nahusha was born Yayati whose son was Nabhaga. Nabhaga's son was Aja. Aja was the father of Dasaratha and Dasaratha, the father of  Rama and Lakshmana.",
                "Vasishta having thus described (the genealogy of Dasaratha) Janaka with folded hands rejoined, \"Be blessed. Let me relate the genealogy  of my race. Listen\". \"O Great sage O Best of ascetics while one offers his daughter (in marriage), one born in a noble family should describe his genealogy in full. Listen. There was a great man of religion king Nimi, strongest of men and wellknown in the three worlds by his own acts. Nimi begot a son named Mithi who constructed Mithila. He was the first Janaka whose son was Udavasu. Virtuous Nandivardhana was the son of Udavasu whose son was Suketu. Suketu's son was the righteous and powerful Devarata, father of Brihadradha. Brihadradha's son was the heroic and powerful Mahavira, father of Sudhruti, who was armed with courage and the power of truth. To Sudhruti was born the righteous Drishtaketu, committed to dharma. Rajarshi Drishtaketu was father to the wellknown Haryasva. Haryasva's son was Maru, father of Pratindhaka. Pratindhaka's son was the righteous king Kirtiratha. The son of Kirtiratha was known as Devamidha. His son was Vibudha, father of Mahidhraka. Mighty king Kirtirata was the son of Mahidhraka. He was a Rajarshi, father of Maharoma. To Maharoma's was born the virtuous Swarnaroma. Swarnaroma's son was Hrasvaroma. Hrasvaroma, was a religious king. He was a great soul. Of his two sons. I am the eldest and valiant Kusadhwaja is my younger brother. My father king Hrasvaroma crowned me king, entrusted Kusadhwaja to my care and retired to the forest. After my aged father attained heaven, I looked after my brother Kusadhwaja, who resembles the celestials, affectionately and ruled the kingdom with righteousness. A little later a powerful king named Sudhanva from the city of Sankasya beseiged Mithila. He (Sudhanva) sent me a message: 'give me the great bow of Siva and the lotuseyed maiden Sita'. O Brahmarshi when I refused, a great conflict broke out between him and me. In the encounter king Sudhanva was killed by me. O Best of ascetics having killed king Sudhanva, I have crowned my heroic brother Kusadhwaja in Sankasya. O Great ascetic (Vasishta), this one is my youger brother and I am the elder one. O preeminent among ascetics with immense pleasure I am giving these maidens, Sita to Rama and Urmila to Lakshmana. Be blessed I offer my daughter Sita, who looks like a celestial maiden as reward for (Rama's) prowess and my second daughter Urmila (to Lakshmana). I proclaim it three times so that there is no doubt about it. O Delight of the Raghus (King Dasaratha), I offer these brides with immense pleasure to Rama and Lakshmana. You may perform the rites for your forefathers by gift of cows. Prosperity to you. Thereafter you may perform the marriage.

                "When Janaka the valiant king of Videha thus spoke (on the genealogy of his family) the mighty ascetic Viswamitra accompanied by Vasishta said to Janaka: \"O Preeminent among men the glory of the two races of Ikshvakus as also of Videhas is in comprehensible and immeasurable. There is none equal to these kings of the Ikshvakus and Videhas. O King it is a perfect match between Sita and Rama and Urmila and Lakshmana. In respect of piety and beauty  the match is perfect. O Best of men my words deserve to be heard. This younger brother king Kusadhwaja is knower of righteousness. O King, O Eminent among men we seek the hands of this virtuous king's two daughters, unrivalled in beauty, on earth, as consorts. O king we choose your brother's daughters for the great souls: the young Bharata and the sagacious Satrughna. Bestowed with youth and beauty, these sons of Dasaratha resemble kings in defending the worlds and gods in valour. O King of kings (Janaka) the bond between your race with its pious deeds and the Ikshvakus  may be strenghthened by this alliance\". Having heard the words of Viswamitra which echoed the wish of Vasishta, Janaka replied to the eminent ascetics with folded palms. \"Since both of you, eminent ascetics, recomended this befitting alliance of the two races on your own, I regard my race as blessed. \"Let it be so, Be blessed Let these two daughters of Kusadhwaja (Srutakirti and Mandavi) be the wives of Satrughna and Bharata respectively and serve them. O Great ascetic let the valiant four princes take the hands of four princesses on the same day. \"The wise, O Brahmin think the marriage is favourable when Bhaga is Prajapati on the succeeding day of the ascent of the two stars. (that is, when poorva is followed by uttara phalguni). King Janaka, having spoken these pleasing words, stood up and with folded hands  addressing both the great ascetics: \"You have earned me a great religious merit. I shall be always your disciple O Eminent ascestics, occupy these important seats\". \"Dasaratha has right on the city of Ayodhya as much as I have on this. This right is unquestionable. So do whatever you think right\". To the words of Janaka, king of Videha, king Dasaratha, the descendant of Raghu cheerfully replied: \"You both brothers are lords of Mithila. You possess countless virtues. You pay regards to  many rishis and hosts of kings\". \"Be safe. Be blessed. Let me retire to the camp. I have to perform the rites offerings to the forefathers\". Then renowned king Dasaratha, took leave of the two great ascetics. Then the rowned king Dasaratha took have of the king (Janaka) immediately following the two great ascetics. The king (Dasaratha) reached the abode, performed the sharaddha ceremony in accordance with the scriptures. Next day at dawn at appropriate time he gifted away cows (a ceremony performed by initiating the bridegrooms into the marriage.) For the welfare of each of his sons the king (Dasaratha) religiously gave away a hundred thousand cows to brahmins. Great among men and affectionate towards his children, (king Dasaratha), the delight of the Raghus donated in the name of his sons' donates to the brahmins four hundred thousand cows. They were capable of abundance of milk. Their horns were plaited with gold. They were accompanied by calves. With them were given away bellmetal vessels for keeping milk and innumerable valuables.

                "The day the king (Dasaratha) made a gift of the best (available) cows the heroic Yudhajit arrived. Yudhajit, son of king Kekaya, Bharata's own maternal uncle met the king (Dasaratha) and enquiring about his wellbeing said: \"My father, king of Kekaya affectionately enquires about your welfare. And they whose welfare you seek  are hale and healthy. The king of Kekaya, O Indra among kings, O Joy of the Raghus, desires to see my  sisters's son and on that account I went to Ayodhya. O King having heard in Ayodhya that you have arrived in Mithila along with your sons for their marriage I came here speedily with a desire to see my sister's son . King Dasaratha, then accorded a warm welcome to the honoured guest. With the night spent with his virtuous sons, he who knew his duties got up at dawn and performed his daily devotionas and reached the sacrificial place following the  rishis. With the night spent with his virtuous sons, he who knew his duties got up at dawn and performed his daily devotionas and reached the sacrificial place following the  rishis.

With the necessary auspicious rites preparatory to marriage performed at an auspicious moment, Vijaya, and keeping Vasishta and other maharshis in the forefront,  Rama accompanied by his brothers adorned with ornaments of every kind came into his  father's presence. Adorable Vasishta approached king Janaka and said, \"O King, of Videha king Dasaratha, the best of men with his sons having performed the auspicious rites preparatory to marriage is awaiting the bestower of the brides\". The giver and the receiver, indeed, attain all ends. Fulfil  your own duty by performing the auspicious marriage\". Thus addressed by the great self Vasishta, Janaka, the exceedingly generous, highly lustrous, eminent in ethics replied. \"Did any guard prevent you? Whose command are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate to enter into your own house? This kingdom is like your kingdom\". O Best of ascetics my daughters have performed all the rites relating to marriage. They (now) stand at the foot of the altar shining like the bright flames of fire. Ready at the altar, I have been awaiting you, O King Without hindrance proceed Why delay?\". At the words of Janaka, Dasaratha brought his sons along with the hosts of ascetics and entered the marriage pavilion. Thereafter the king of the Videhas to Vasishta, \"O Adherent of righteousness, O Lord O Maharshi perform with the rishis the marriage ceremony of Rama who causes delight to the three worlds\". Thereafter the king of the Videhas to Vasishta, \"O Adherent of righteousness, O Lord O Maharshi perform with the rishis the marriage ceremony of Rama who causes delight to the three worlds\". Venerable and renowned ascetic Vasishta said \"Be it so\".And with Viswamitra and virtuous Satananda in the forefront, an altar was duly improvised in the centre of the sacrificial pavilion. He adorned the altar on all sides  with fragrant flowers, golden ladles, waterpots with holes filled with sprouts, earthen vessels with sprouts, holders of burning fragrant incense conchshaped vessels, sacrificial ladles, bowls filled with with water for arghya and other purposes, vessels with roasted paddy and grains of rice.

Brilliant and worshipful rishi Vasishta chanted, mantras according to tradition, put the darbha grass of equal proportions around the altar, placed the fire on the altar, recited the mantras from the scriptures and offered oblations into the flame. Thereafter king Janaka brought Sita adorned with various ornaments and placed her in the presence of Agni in front of Rama, the enhancer of the joy of Kausalya. And said: Thereafter king Janaka brought Sita adorned with various ornaments and placed her in the presence of Agni in front of Rama, the enhancer of the joy of Kausalya. And said: \"This my daughter Sita will be your partner in performing her rightful duty. Accept her. Farewell. Take her hand into your own. By being a devoted wife this highly fortunate Sita would always follow you like a shadow\". Thus spoken, he sprinkled the water sanctified with mantras (on them). Then gods and sages exclaimed: 'well, well'. Celestial kettledrums were sounded and there was a steady rain of flowers. Then king Janaka sprinkled on Sita waters sanctified by mantras, and immersed in delight said: \"Lakshmana come and accept my daughter. Urmila ready to be bestowed upon you by me. Take her hand. Let there be no delay\". Janaka, having spoken thus to Lakshmana addressed Bharata: \"O Descendant of the Raghus hold Mandavi's hand in your own\". The righteous king Janaka, said again: \"O Mightyarmed Satrughna take the hands of Srutakirti\". O Descendants of Kakustha (Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna) you all are gentle. You possess sound character. You are true to your vows. Live with your wives. Let there be no delay\". At the words of Janaka the four princes took the hands of the four sisters with their own with the consent of Vasishta . The great, noble princes of the race of Raghu, accompanied by their wives circumambulated the altar of the sacred fire. King Janaka and the sages in obedience to the directions of Vasishta and in accordance with the sastras conducted the matrimonial. While the descendants of Kakustha (Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna) held the elegant hands (of Sita, Urmila, Mandavi, and Srutakirti) there was a heavy rain of bright flowers from the sky.",
                "Night over, the great ascetic Viswamitra, profusely blessed the princes born in the race of Raghu, took leave of the two kings and set out towards the northern (Himalayas) mountains. With the departure of Viswamitra, king Dasaratha who was the source of happiness to his subjects took leave of Janaka, king of Mithila and speedily set out for the city of Ayodhya. King Janaka, lord of the Videhas, gave plenty of gifts to his daughters and followed king Dasaratha for some distance on his journey to Ayodhya. The king of Mithila and father of the brides gave a hundred thousand cows, excellent woollen carpets, crores of silk garments, four divisions of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry and welldecorated, excellent male and  maidservants shining in celestial beauty. The king of Mithila and father of the brides gave a hundred thousand cows, excellent woollen carpets, crores of silk garments, four divisions of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry and welldecorated, excellent male and  maidservants shining in celestial beauty. Immensely delighted, he gave his excellent daughters gold, pearls and corals. The Lord of Mithila bestowed a lot of wealth on his daughters and with the consent of the king (Dasaratha) reentered his residence in Mithila. King Dasaratha of Ayodhya also left along with his great sons preceded by the sages and followed by the army. While this tiger among men Dasaratha, was returning with the hosts of sages and his sons, he observed here and there frightening birds making disagreeable sounds. Seeing the beasts on the way rushing to the right the tiger among men, enquired of Vasishta: \"While the frightening birds are inauspicious, the deer on the right are favourables Why is this? My heart beats. My mind is depressed. To these words of king Dasaratha the great ascetic Vasishta replied in a gentle voice, \"I shall tell you the consequences Listen\". The dreadful cries from the mouths of birds foretell an event of celestial nature likely to befall but the movements other of deer indicate restoration of peace. Therefore do not grieve. While they were conversing, a storm blew, shaking the earth and felling down beautiful trees. The Sun was wrapped in dark. The quarters were devoid of brightness. The entire army was covered with ashes, as if they fainted. At that time Vasishta and other saints, the king and his sons held their senses under control. All others lost their consciousness. In that dreadful darkness while the army looked as if covered with ashes, king Dasaratha encountered the repressor of kings, descendant of Bhrugu and son of Jamadagni with a terrible crown of matted hair, inaccessible like Kailasa mountain and unendurable like the fire at the time of dissolution. The laymen gazing at his blazing energy,hanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like Siva at the time of slaying of Tripura.

The laymen gazing at his blazing energy,hanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like Siva at the time of slaying of Tripura. At the sight of the fearful appearance of Parasurama looking like flaming fire, Vasishta and all other saints who were in the habit of chanting mantras and offering oblations to the fire whispered among themselves: Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is he intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past he was freed from anger and grief. Is he again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas? Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is he intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past he was freed from anger and grief. Is he again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas? The saints having thus talked amongst themselves, offered arghya to the son of Bhargava, of dreadful appearance and addressed him in soothing words: \"O Rama O Rama\". Valiant Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, having accepted the homage offered by the saints addressed Rama, son of Dasaratha and said:      : Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Rama, Rama, son of Dasaratha I have heard in full of your marvellous prowess and your feat in breaking the bow of Siva. The fact that you have broken Siva's bow is an astonishing act. It is beyond imagination. Having heard it I have come here with another auspicious bow. This mighty, dreadful bow was obtained through Jamadagni. You may display your prowess by fixing on it an arrow. O Rama after witnessing your strength in stretching and stringing this bow, I shall engage you in a duel acclaiming your prowess\". When king Dasaratha heard these words, his face fell. He humbly pleaded with him his hands folded: \"You are a brahmana, highly renowned and withdrawn from anger against kshatriyas. It behoves of you to give assurance of security to my sons who are young. Born in the family of (saint) Bhrigu versed in the study of the Vedas and  observance of vows. You have promised in the name of  the thousandeyed Indra to renounce the arms. By adhering to righteousness in life and having conferred the earth upon Kasyapa, you retired to the forest and made your residence on the Mahendra mountain. O Great ascetic today you have arrived evidently for the total destruction of our family. If Rama is killed none of us will survive\". Disregarding these words of Dasaratha, the valiant son of Jamadagni said to Rama. \"These two excellent celestial bows are wellknown throughout the worlds. They are stout and strong. They are the best of all, wellmade by Visvakarma. O Best among men O Descendant of Kakustha one of these broken by you, was given by the gods to the threeeyed Siva, who, wishing to fight the demon Tripura with this bow, destroyed him. This second bow which is unassailable was given by chief of the celestials to Visnu. O Rama born in the race of Kakutstha this highly radiant bow of Visnu is as strong as the bow of Siva. Then all the gods in order to ascertain the strength and weakness of Siva and Visnu enquired of the Grandsire, Brahma: Foremost among the truthful, Grandsire Brahma come to know the intention of the gods and triggered a conflict between the gods. In that thrilling fight between Siva and Visnu, each desirous of victory over the other, a ferocious battle took place causing one's hair to stand on end. Then, with the 'Humkara' produced by Visnu, Siva's bow of dreadful prowess was stretched, which struck the threeeyed Mahadeva motionless. Then hosts of sages, charanas and the gods assembled there and beseeched both of them, the preeminent among the gods to keep peace. Now that the bow of Siva was made inert by Visnu's prowess, hosts of sages and  gods acknowlged Visnu as superior. Glorious Siva, enraged at this, placed the bow together with the arrow in the hands of Rajarshi Devarata in the country of Videha. This bow of Visnu, O Rama capable of conquering hostile cities, was given in trust to Richika belonging to the race of Bhrigu. Brilliant Ruchika gave this bow to his son, the great Jamadagni, my father, a man of unrivalled valour. My father equipped with ascetic energy renounced the weapon and was killed by Kartaveeryarjuna in a vulgar manner. O Rama Having heard the slaying of my father incomparable in extreme ruthlessness, I decimated the Kshatriya race again and again out of fury as they were born and reborn. I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode.

I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode. O Mighty Rama when I heard that you have broken the bow with your extraordinary prowess, I have come here quickly. Respect the duties of a kshatriya, O Rama Take hold of this great, uncommon bow of Visnu inherited by me from my father and forefathers. O Descendant of Kakustha this best bow is capable of conquering enemy cities. Fix an arrow. If it is possible for you to do so, then I shall engage you in a duel\".      :  Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the words of the son of Jamadagni (Parasurama), Rama, the son of Dasaratha, avoiding further conversation out of respect for his father intercepted Parasurama saying: \"O Descendant of Bhrigu I have listened to the (marvellous) acts you have performed. O Brahman I commend you for discharging your duty in repaying the debt to your father. You underrate me O Bhargava as though I am devoid of valour and incompetent to perform the duties of a Kshatriya. Now witness my energy and valour. Having spoken thus, the enraged Rama, gifted with quick vigour, seized the bow and arrow from Parasurama's hands. Infuriated Rama bent the bow stretched it, fixed the arrow and addressed Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni: \"You are a brahmin, O Parasurama. You are also related to Viswamitra. Hence you are worthy of homage. I cannot, therefore, release this against you to take your life. I shall destroy your mobility, O Parasurama or the higher worlds earned through your matchless asceteic energy. Tell me which one you choose. On conquering the hostile cities and destroying the pride and strength of the enemy by its prowess, this celestial arrow of Visnu shall not go in vain\". The gods with the Grandsire, Brahma in the forefront, accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see Rama holding that mighty bow. Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder.

Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder. Then when Rama stretched the great bow, the world became motionless. The son of Jamadagni, Parasurama, bereft of prowess gazed at him with astonishment. His energy subdued by Rama's prowess, the paralysed, Parasurama, son of Jamadagni spoke in gentle words to him whose eyes resembled the lotus petals: \"When I gave this entire earth to Kasyapa, he said to me, 'you shall not live in my country'. O Descendant of Kakustha having gifted this earth to Kasyapa, I promised him that I would not live here, during night time. For the earth belongs to him. For this, you should not destroy my mobility, O valiant son of the Raghus. I shall go to Mahendra, the best of mountains, with the speed of mind. Strike with the, principal arrow the unrivalled worlds conquered by my asceticism. Do not delay, O Rama By the fact that you have stretched this bow, I have come to know that you are Visnu, Lord of the gods, slayer of Madhu, O Imperishable one O Tormentor of enemies Fare well. All your deeds are incomparable. You are unassailable in combat. All these hosts of gods have assembled here and are looking at you. I have been defeated by you, O Descendant of Kakustha lord of the three worlds. Therefore, it is not right for me to feel ashamed. You are faithful to vows O Rama This arrow has no equal in prowess. It behoves of you to release it against me. After its release I shall go to the excellent Mahendra  mountain\". Thus spoke  Parasurama, son of Jamadagni to Rama, the valiant son of Dasaratha who (then) discharged the principal arrow. Having witnessed the destruction of those regions earned by him through asceticism, the son of Jamadagni left for the best of mountains Mahendra. Thereafter all the quarters including the intermediaries were cleared of darkness. Hosts of sages and gods extolled Rama when he wielded the bow. Parasurama, the competent son of Jamadagni, having praised Rama, the son of Dasaratha circumbulated him and left for his abode.      : Thus ends the seventysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Parasurama departed, Rama, son of Dasaratha with a serene mind gave the bow along with the arrow to Varuna of immeasurable strength. Thereafter Rama the descendant of the Raghus, paid obeisance to Vasishta and other rishis, and looked at his father who appeared agitated said: \"Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, has gone. Let the four divisions of the army of  which you are the commander proceed towards Ayodhya. The army which is under your command O King is awaiting your orders like the chatakas awaiting water. Direct them (to proceed). On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced him and kissed his forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt he and his son were reborn. On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced him and kissed his forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt he and his son were reborn. Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance. When he    reached the city of Ayodhya it looked welldecorated with flags and banners. It  resounded with trumpets. The royal highways were sprinkiled with water and strewn with flowers. It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of  the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments. Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance.

It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of  the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments. Prosperous king Dasaratha of great fame followed by his elegant sons entered the city of Ayodhya while the citizens and brahmins came forward from a long distance to welcome him who reentered his palace looking like the Himalayan mountain. The king and his kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner. Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides. The king and his kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner. Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides. Thereafter the queens received the highly fortunate Sita, Urmila of high fame and both the daughters of Kusadhwaja, Mandavi and Srutakirti. With auspicious aricles in their hands, all the new brides who shone in silken apparels immediately went to temples and worshipped the family deities. Then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of Kubera.Thereafter pleased with gifting  cows, riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy Then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of Kubera.Thereafter pleased with gifting  cows, riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy All the princes who were best of men, great souls, incomparable in prowess on earth, capable of the use of weapons and endowed with wealth moved about with friends, serving their father and following his commands. After some time king Dasaratha the delight of the Raghu race addressed his son Bharata: \"The heroic Yudhajit son of the king of Kekaya, your maternal uncle, has come here and wishes to take you with him, O Child O Knower of dharma this was his request to me in Mithila in the midst of sages. You should bring him delight (by obliging him). Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Bharata, son of Kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and Rama, embraced Lakshmana and prepared for the journey with Satrughna. Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Bharata, son of Kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and Rama, embraced Lakshmana and prepared for the journey with Satrughna. Valiant Bharata, the best of men took leave of his father Dasaratha, a tireless brother Rama and mothers and departed with Satrughna. After the departure of Bharata, mighty Rama  and Lakshmana continued to serve their godlike father. Righteous Rama discharged his duties towards the citizens for their allround comfort and welfare giving top priority to (the execution of) the command of his father. With unfailing regularity Rama carried out his duties towards his mothers, and his elders, looking into them from time to time. Dasaratha was pleased with the good conduct and character of Rama. Brahmanas as also the inhabitants of the city and the people of the country at large were happy with him. In world the glorious and virtuous Rama armed with the power of truthfulness became the protector of the people like Brahma (to living beings). With his heart fixed on Sita to whom he was always devoted, Rama, the wise went about enjoying with her (the beauty of) all the seasons. Chosen by his father Sita became Rama's beloved wife with her virtue and beauty his affection for her grew further. For sita her husband was doubly dear. They were clearly communicating through each other's heart every thought generated in the mind."

                "Bharata set out for his maternal uncle's house. He took with him the sinless Satrughna who is always successful in destroying foes and on whom he had bestowed his love and affection. Treated with warm hospitality and fatherly affection by his maternal uncle Aswapati, Bharata stayed on there along with his brother. Though both the heroic brothers stayed there satisfied on their own they constantly remembered their aged father. The glorious king Dasaratha also remembered his sons, Bharata and Satrughna, who  were like the great Indra and Varuna, (now) away from home. Dasaratha, a bull among men, loved all his four sons equally just as the  arms of his own body. Even among them the brilliant Rama was a source of delight to his father like the Selfborn (Brahma) to all living beings. Entreated by the devatas desirous of slaying arrogant Ravana, the eternal Visnu was indeed born in the mortal world as Rama. Kausalya looked splendid with her son, Rama of boundless energy, as did Aditi with the chief of the gods Indra, wielder of thunder. Endowed with beauty and strengh, free from envy, and in virtues equal to Dasaratha, Rama was verily an incomparable son on earth. With an unfailing serenity of mind, Rama never paid back harshness with harshness. Gifted with selfrestraint, Rama was pleased even with a single benefit done somehow to him, yet did not remember even a hundred offences  committed by others. Even during intervals of  his practice of weapons he never failed to interact with saintly persons and with people advanced in age, virtue and wisdom. Wise and softspoken, he was the first to speak to others words pleasing to hear. Though mighty, he was never proud of his overwhelming strength. Rama never told lies. He was a learned man. He honoured elders by going forward to them. He loved his subjects as much as his subjects loved him. He was kindhearted and compassionate to the distressed, coolheaded and righteous. A worshipper of brahmins he was always selfrestrained and pure in spirit. He entertained thoughts befitting his (great) dynasty and honoured the code of conduct of a kshatriya. He believed one could attain heavenly abode through his great achievements. A learned man, he evinced no interest in pursuits that did not contribute to one's welfare or had he any liking for speaking against others. But in debates his oratorical flourish was comparable to Brihaspati's.  He was young, eloquent, healthy and free from disease. He was conscious of (right) time and place (for his pursuits). He was capable of ascertaining the potentiality of men. He was born a sage in this world. Bestowed with such excellent qualities, the prince (Rama) became a favourite of his subjects.  He was like their vital life outside their bodies. With the appropriate sacred ablution marking the completion of the vow relating to the respective branches of learning in accordance with tradition, this elder brother of Bharata achieved proficiency in the Vedas and its auxiliary sciences. He surpassed his father in archery. Born in a family of noble descent, he was saintly. A man without meanness.He was truthful and a man of rectitude. The training he received under aged brahmins conversant with dharma and artha made him welldisciplined. He knew the true nature of dharma, artha and kama. With a sharp memory,  he was a genius. He was highly skilled in accomplishing tasks related to social practices and customs. He (Rama) was modest and did not reveal his inner feelings. He counselled in secrecy and had good friends. Never was his anger or pleasure in vain. He knew the occasion  when to sacrifce and when to exercise restraint.  He was firm in his devotion and steady in intellect. He accepted nothing ignoble nor used bad words. He was not swayed by emotions or prone to idleness. He knew his faults as well as of others. He was versed in scriptures. He was grateful (to those who did him some good) and skilled in differentiating the comparative merits of men. Fair in his judgement he dispensed justice in accordance with law by reprimanding (the delinquent) and favouring (the honest). He was skilled in  receiving and encouraging the righteous and in punishing (the wicked). He knew  whom to punish. He knew the right means of raising revenue and also expending money in the prescribed manner. He obtained proficiency in scriptures and interconnected (mutually contradictory) branches of learning. Only after having grasped the (philosophy of) artha (statecraft) and dharma (righteousness), he sought pleasure. He was never indolent. He had understanding of art and craft useful for entertainment. He knew proper  ways of dispensing wealth. He was experienced in riding elephants and horses and in humbling them. He was the best among those skilled in archery in this world. He was reckoned as a great wielder of warchariots and one who strikes at the enemies by advancing towards them. He was an expert in commanding troops. (Atiratha is an excellent warrior who can manage his chariot, horses and the charioteer.) He was incapable of being repressed even by the enraged devatas or rakshasas in the battle. He was free from envy and had subdued his anger and pride. He was never malicious and he never slighted any living being nor did he bow to the pressure of time. Thus endowed with such excellent qualities, the subjects in the three worlds held him in high esteem. In forbearance he was like the earth, in wisdom like Brihaspati and in prowess like the consort of Sachi (Indra). Rama whose virtues were cherished by all his subjects was a source of delight to his father and he shone like the rays of the resplendent Sun. The earth desired him as her lord, for he was bestowed with such avowed virtues and with indomitable prowess equal to all the guardians of the quarters. Observing his son endowed with such innumerable and incomparable virtues, king Dasaratha, subduer of enemies started thinking. Thereafter, flashed in the mind of that aged king who had (already) lived long this pleasant thought as to how Rama will become king while he was alive. The thought of seeing his dear son coronated repeatedly surfaced his mind so great was his affection (for Rama). (He said to himself) 'his (Rama's) only desire is to promote the prosperity of this world. He is one who shows compassion to all beings and is like the raingod dearer than me to the people of the world'. 'In prowess he is equal to Yama and Indra,in wisdom to Brihaspati and in firmness to a mountain and in virtues greater than me'. 'Seeing my son ruling this entire dominion of the earth, I will experience the bliss of attaining heaven at this age.' King Dasaratha in consultation with his ministers observed that Rama is endowed  with various virtues not found in other kings, immeasurable virtues which are praiseworthy, and exemplary. He is distinguished in this world as all qualities seem to have merged in him. The king then made up his mind to make him princeregent.

He is distinguished in this world as all qualities seem to have merged in him. The king then made up his mind to make him princeregent. The sagacious king, too perceived his body ageing and the portentous omens in the heaven, in the sky and on the earth causing dreadful concern. The king realised afterwards that his grief would be dispelled if noble Rama whose countenance resembled the full moon and who was a favourite of the people is crowned. Longing for it, the noble king realized that the time was ripe for the acceleration of the process of safeguarding his own and his subjects' welfare. He summoned individually kings and all important citizens residing in various cities and villages of this earth. The king did not invite both the kings of Kekaya and Janaka  in  haste with an  intention that they would hear the glad news at a later date. The king who received them in a befitting manner and provided them with residence and ornaments looked like lord Brahma adorned by the people. After the king (Dasaratha) who was a tormenter of enemy forces was seated, the rest of the kings beloved of their subjects entered (the assembly hall). Then  the kings (who entered the assembly) took the seats assigned to them facing the king (Dasaratha), following the royal tradition. Surrounded by those feudatory kings endowed with modesty, and received with due honour and by the respectful residents of cities and villages, the king (Dasaratha), resembled lord Indra, the thousand eyed encircled by the gods.       Thus ends the first sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, the lord of the earth (king Dasaratha) addressed the entire assembly of  invitees. He spoke these pleasing words aimed at their welfare which thrilled and delighted the hearts (of the assembled kings):  Lord of men (king Dasaratha) addressed the feudatory kings with words deep, resonant, loud like the kettledrum or the rumbling cloud, in a delightful, incomparable and attractive voice that carried all the dignity of royalty:  Lord of men (king Dasaratha) addressed the feudatory kings with words deep, resonant, loud like the kettledrum or the rumbling cloud, in a delightful, incomparable and attractive voice that carried all the dignity of royalty: It is wellknown to all of you that people of this greatest kingdom were ruled by my predecessors who were great kings, who looked after the subjects as though they were their own children. I desire to  accomplish the welfare of this entire world which deserves the happiness brought about by the rule of all the Ikshvaku kings.  Following the path of my forefathers I protected the people to the best of my ability by being ever vigilant. My body has attained old age after ruling the entire world ensuring the welfare of the people under the shade of royal white parasol. Having lived for thousands of years this body is now worn out  due to old age and therefore I want rest. I am weary of carrying on the heavy burden of duty and find it difficult to sustain the rule of dharma. It can be shouldered by those who have royal qualities (of might, courage etc) and not by those who have not controlled their senses. Therefore, after convincing all of you, the best of (learned) brahmins present here, I intend to take rest by installing my son to look after the welfare of the people. My eldest son Rama, inheriting every virtue of mine, is a conqueror of enemy cities  and is equal to Indra in prowess. I propose to install him (Rama), foremost among upholders of righteousness and the best of men who resembles the Moon in brightness when in conjunction with Pushya star, as heirapparent to the throne. With him (Rama) as ruler, all the three worlds will also have a better protector.That elder brother of Lakshmana with signs of greatness is certainly the most befitting to rule this kingdom. I shall be relieved of my anxiety  by entrusting the land (ruled by me) to my son (Rama) without any more delay and thus ensure the continued welfare of this world. Although it (this decision) is personally favourable to me and I have decided after seeking good counsel, you should also give me your consent and tell me what I should do. Although this is what I would like to do, please suggest alternative ways of achieving the welfare (of this kingdom). Deliberations by the unbiased (on this issue) may bring good. Having thus heard king Dasaratha speak, the kings acclaimed him with delight, like peacocks crying (in joy) to see thick clouds. There emanated cries of love and joy from the multitude of people (conveying their approval) whose reverberation seemed to shake the palace. Brahmins, kings and other prominent men, inhabitants of towns and villages  having  fully known the views of Dasaratha who was conversant with artha and dharma  joined together and deliberated. They thought out well and having arrived at unanimity in their thinking thus addressed the aged king Dasaratha.

They thought out well and having arrived at unanimity in their thinking thus addressed the aged king Dasaratha. O mighty king, you have grown many thousands of years old. Therefore, you should coronate Rama as prince regent of this kingdom. We cherish to see the mightyarmed hero among the Raghus, Rama, riding on a majestic elephant, his countenance shadowed by the royal parasol. Having heard them king Dasaratha, pretending as though he was not aware of their heart's desire but was now wishing to ascertain it, spoke these words: O kings, soon after listening to my words, all of you wish Rama to be king. (But) I doubt (in my mind) whether you have said it from your heart When the earth is being ruled righteously by me why indeed you intend to see my son as prince regent? Those kings along with the inhabitants of towns and villages answered the  magnanimous king: O king your son, indeed has many auspicious and admirable  virtues. O king, we shall now speak about those great virtues of the sagacious (Rama). Comparable to those of the gods, they are dear and a source of delight for every one. Please listen. Lord of the people Rama with his divine virtues is equal to Indra. He with his  proven valour is exceptional among all the descendents of the Iksvakus. Devoted to truth and righteousness Rama is the most venerable among men in this world. Even righteousness along with prosperity flows directly from Rama. He is equal to the Moon in causing happiness to the people, to the earth in forbearance, to Brihaspati in wisdom and to Indra in prowess.  Rama knows the ways of righteousness. He is true to his word and free from envy. He possesses a sound character with forbearance, gentleness and a sense of gratitude. With his senses under control, he is a source of consolation (in stressful times). This son of the Raghus (Rama) is softspoken, steadfast, always serene, truthful and  free from envy. He is pleasing to all beings. He serves those elderly brahmins versed in many lores. With these virtues his incomparable glory, fame and splendour have steadily grown. This son of the Raghus (Rama) is softspoken, steadfast, always serene, truthful and  free from envy. He is pleasing to all beings. He serves those elderly brahmins versed in many lores. With these virtues his incomparable glory, fame and splendour have steadily grown. He is an expert in wielding all kinds of weapons available to devas, asuras and  men. He has achieved mastery over all sciences and has appropriately acquired knowledge of the Vedas and its ancillary sciences. This elder brother of Bharata is the greatest exponent in music on earth. Pious, sagacious, free from meanness, he is of noble descent. Whenever he, wellinstructed in all matters by the best of brahmins wellversed in dharma and artha proceeds along with Lakshmana to wage a war for the sake of a village or a town, he never returns without conquering the enemy. While returning from the battlefield, either on a chariot or an elephant Rama stops and  enquires in detail and in order, the welfare of the citizens as he would do for his kith and kin. He enquires about the welfare of their children, sacred  rituals, wives, their servants and disciples as a father would enquire of his sons.

He enquires about the welfare of their children, sacred  rituals, wives, their servants and disciples as a father would enquire of his sons. Rama, a tiger among men, always enquires whether our disciples discharge their duties. He grieves profoundly whenever people are afflicted by misfortunes (and) rejoices like a father on festive occasions. . He is one who speaks the truth. He is a great archer, one who has conquered his senses and serves the aged. He speaks with a  smile and protects dharma with all his heart. He helps those who take refuge in him. He is not  interested in conversation leading to  dissentions. But during debates he is eloquent like Brihaspati (establing the truth on the basis of reasoning).  Rama, who is the source of delight to the world, has charming eyebrows and large coppercoloured eyes. He is endowed with heroism, bravery and valour like Visnu manifested. He is proficient in the ways and means of ruling the people. His senses are not overpowered by passion. He alone is capable of ruling the three worlds, what to speak the earth His anger or favour never goes in vain. He kills those who rightly deserve to be killed  and flares not at those whose life is to be spared. When pleased, Rama bestows wealth. Like the Sun shining with his rays, He shines  with his qualities of tranquil, charming and loving nature. When pleased, Rama bestows wealth. Like the Sun shining with his rays, He shines  with his qualities of tranquil, charming and loving nature. The earth desired to have Rama, richly endowed with such virtues, possessing proven  prowess, comparable to Indra and other regents of the world, as her lord. O son of the Raghus (Dasaratha), because of  your good  fortune that Rama, endowed with the qualities of an ideal son like Kasyapa to Maricha was born to you for the welfare of this world.  Gandharvas, uragas, devas, asuras, the inhabitants of towns and villages, all men living in neighbouring or distant regions are wish the illustrious Rama strength, health and long life.  Gandharvas, uragas, devas, asuras, the inhabitants of towns and villages, all men living in neighbouring or distant regions are wish the illustrious Rama strength, health and long life. Women, young and old alike devoutly invoke at dusk and at dawn all the gods for the sake of the celebrated Rama. O Lord let the peoples' prayer be fulfilled by your blessings. We would like to see your son Rama of the complexion of a bluelotus and destroyer of enemies as prince regent. O bestower of boons it behoves you to install with delight and without delay your son (Rama) endowed with all virtues equal to god of the gods and committed to our wellbeing and to the welfare of this world, as your heirapparent.       Thus ends the second sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The citizens held out their palms folded like lotuses in reverence and urged  king Dasaratha in all possible ways (to coronate Rama). He reciprocated their respect with words preasing and beneficial to them: I am immensely happy that you have added to my incomparable resilience with your  desire to see my beloved eldest son installed heirapparent.  Having honoured them (the invitees) in return for their response, king Dasaratha addressed Vasistha, Vamadeva and other brahmins. This auspicious month of Chaitra is sacred with its blossoming groves. Let all the arrangements be made for the installation of Rama as heirapparent. On hearing this, all the members of the assembly applauded the king tumultously. With the tumult gradually calmed down, the lord of the people, the king (Dasaratha) spoke this to Vasistha, a tiger among ascetics: O revered one, you should issue appropriate orders to keep ready the necessary articles required for the performance of installation ceremony of Rama. Hearing the words of  the king, Vasistha, best of the brahmins thus ordered the counsellors who stood in front of the king with folded palms:  By tomorrow early morning arrange in the place set aside for sacred fire in the king's palace gold and other metals, gems, articles of worship, also herbs, garlands of white flowers, roasted corn, honey and clarified butter in separate containers, fresh clothes, chariot, weapons of every kind, army of four divisions, an elephant possessing auspicious marks, white fans made of Yak's hair, a standard, white parasol, a hundred golden vessels shining like fire, a bull with goldplated horns and a tiger skin.

Even the smallest items required be arranged. Let the gates of the inner apartment and of the entire city be decorated with sandalpaste and garlands. Let fragrant incense be burnt for worship. Arrange fine rice cooked with milk and curd sufficient for a hundred thousand brahmins to eat to their heart's content. At dawn tomorrow the best of brahmins be honoured with cooked rice clarified butter, curd, roasted corn and gifts in abundance. As soon as the Sun rises tomorrow, arrangements be made for Swastivachana (a benedictory utterance). Brahmins be invited and seats provided to them. Banners be fastened and royal highways be sprinkled with water. All  actors and beautifully adorned courtesans should reach the second inner apartment of the king's residence and remain seated there. Persons to cater food and other eatables and to hold garlands and gifts be stationed at all temples and other places of worship. Let all the warriors in fresh clothes, armed with long swords and fully alert enter the courtyard of the glorious king. The two highly selfdisciplined ascetics (Vasistha and Vamadeva), having ordered the tasks to be performed and whatever remained to be done reported to the king. Satisfied with the arrangements, the two illustrious brahmins(Vasistha and Vamadeva) approached the lord of the earth (Dasaratha) with delight and said All things have been arranged in accordance with your word of command. Thereafter the glorious king said to Sumantra, Bring immediately the selfpossessed Rama. In response to the king's command Sumantra, the best of charioteers said, 'so be it'  and fetched Rama in a chariot. After Sumantra had gone, the kings from eastern, northern, western, southern  nonAryan and Aryan countries, rulers from forests and mountains paid homage to king Dasaratha, as devatas do to Indra. After Sumantra had gone, the kings from eastern, northern, western, southern  nonAryan and Aryan countries, rulers from forests and mountains paid homage to king Dasaratha, as devatas do to Indra. The rajarsi, (Dasaratha), seated among the kings like Indra amidst maruts, beheld his son Rama sitting in a chariot and approaching him. Rama appeared as the very image of king of the gandharvas known for his courage in this world. With his long arms, he was extremely handsome with a countenance of the colour of moonstone possessed of immense strength, he walked with the  gait of  an intoxicated elephant. He captivated the eyes and hearts of men with his beauty and generosity. He looked like Parjanya (raingod), gladdening men scorched by heat. Even after (intensely) gazing at Rama approaching, the king (Dasaratha) was not satiated. Rama appeared as the very image of king of the gandharvas known for his courage in this world.

Even after (intensely) gazing at Rama approaching, the king (Dasaratha) was not satiated.  Sumantra assisted Rama while alighting from that splendid chariot and followed him with folded palms as Rama was proceeding towards his father.  Best among men, Rama accompanied by charioteer Sumantra ascended that palace that was lofty as the peak of Kailasa mountain in order to see the king. Rama, approached his father with folded palms and bowed low near him, pronounced his (own) name and touched his father's feet with reverence. Seeing his beloved son Rama who was standing by his side with folded hands in supplication, king Dasaratha, held his folded hands and drew him near and embraced him. The king (Dasaratha) offered Rama a seat on the lofty, glorious throne splendidly  decorated with gold and gems. The lofty seat Rama occupied was illuminated by him resplenderce like mount Meru in the translucent rays of the morning Sun.  That assembly was illumined by (the presence of) Rama like the Moon dazzling the clear autumnal sky bespangled with sparkling planets and stars. The king was delighted to see his beloved son as though he saw his own reflection adorning a mirror. The best among fathers, he (Dasaratha) said these words to his son with a smile, like Kasyapa addressing Devendra. A worthy son of my worthy eldest wife, O Rama, your great virtues have endeared you to me. As you have endeared yourself to these subjects with your virtues, you shall assume the office of heirapparent when Pushya star is in conjunction with the Moon. Admittedly gentle by nature, you are gifted with virtues. O son, even though virtuous,   I shall offer you counsel for your good out of affection for you. With humility, always keep your senses under control. Keep off all violations arising out of lust and anger. With your behaviour keep the ministers and the people satisfied by means direct or indirect. You shall rule the earth by filling granaries of foodgrains and arsenals and keeping the subjects loyal and contented. The friends of such a person will memain pleased like devatas with nectar. Hence conduct yourself with your mind under control. You shall rule the earth by filling granaries of foodgrains and arsenals and keeping the subjects loyal and contented. The friends of such a person will memain pleased like devatas with nectar. Hence conduct yourself with your mind under control.  Having heard this, Rama's friends quickly reported the matter to Kausalya so that she might be happy.  The foremost of women, Kausalya ordered gifts of gold, cows and various kinds of gems to be given to the messengers who brought this good tiding. Having paid his obeisance to the king, Rama ascended the chariot amidst the acclaim of multitudes of men and left for his splendid abode. On hearing such pronouncement by the king, the citizens also felt they have got something beneficial for themselves. They took leave of the king (Dasaratha) and hastening home,  full of joy, began worshipping their gods.       Thus ends the third sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After the citizens departed, the king, an expert in decisionmaking again consulted his counsellors and said, Tomorrow Pushya star is in the ascendence and my son, Rama (handsome) with coppercoloured eyes which resemble red lotus petals will be installed heirapparent. After the citizens departed, the king, an expert in decisionmaking again consulted his counsellors and said, Tomorrow Pushya star is in the ascendence and my son, Rama (handsome) with coppercoloured eyes which resemble red lotus petals will be installed heirapparent. Therafter king Dasaratha on retiring to his private apartment, ordered Sumantra to bring Rama  once again. In obedience to the command  of the king charioteer Sumantra set out speedily  to the palace of Rama to fetch him  back once again. The doorkeepers informed Rama of Sumantra's arrival. As soon as he learnt that Sumantra was back again, Rama was filled with apprehensions. Rama  got Sumantra admitted  and said to him, What is the  purpose of your coming back so quickly ? Tell me whatever is there without holding back. Then Sumantra replied, 'The king desires to see you. To go or not to go, the decision is yours'. On hearing the words of the charioteer, Rama immediately set out for the royal  palace to see the king again. Having heard of Rama's arrival, king Dasaratha got him admitted into his apartment to tell him something very pleasant. On entering his father's palace, glorious Rama, folded his hands and bent low in reverence from a distance and beheld his father. As he (Rama) was bending (with reverence), Dasaratha lifted him up and embraced him. Thereafter, he offered him a splendid seat and said again: O Rama after a long life I have grown old. I have enjoyed all the pleasures I desired. I have also performed hundreds of rituals which enjoined distribution of abundant food and gifts. O best of men I have obtained now a progeny of my liking in you and you have no equal on earth. I have given gifts, performed rituals and also studied (the Vedas) . O mighty son I have experienced all the pleasures I longed for. I redeemed my debt to the gods, the sages, my ancestors, brahmins and to myself. There is nothing left to be done by me except your consecration Hence you should perform what I  tell you. Today  all the subjects expresed their desire to see you as their king. Therefore, my dear son, I wish to coronate  you heirapparent. Moreover Rama, these days I see frightening and ominous events in dreams during day time. I see meteors accompanied by thunders falling, generating great sounds. O Rama astrologers also tell me that formidable planets Sun, Mars and Rahu have afflicted my birth star. When such ominous signs appear, usually the king either meets with  death or faces a grave calamity. Therefore,  before my mind is deluded I wish to see you installed as heirapparent for a man's mind is unstable indeed, O Rama. Today the Moon is in conjunction with the Punarvasu constellation. Tomorrow the  Moon's conjunction with the Pushya constellation is certain and the astrologers say this auspicious time is highly suitable for the purpose of coronation.  My mind is hastening me saying, 'Coronate Rama in the Pushya constellation itself'. O Slayer of enemies, I shall install you heir apparent tomorrow. Therefore, you and my daughterinlaw (Sita) should fast tonight and sleep on a bed of darbha or kusha grass with selfrestraint. Many impediments befall  acts of this sort indeed. Alert your friends to protect you  from all sides today onwards. While Bharata is away from the city, the time is favourable for your installation. This is my opinion. It is true, your brother Bharata has adhered to the path of the virtuous and has followed his elder brother. No doubt, he is righteous, compassionate and self controlled. Yet I think even the propitious minds of those who are virtuous and whose thoughts are fixed in righteousness can also become fickle. Having spoken to Rama about the installation ceremony fixed for the next day, he (Dasaratha) permitted him to leave saying, 'You may go'. Rama paid obeisance to his father and returned to his abode. With the installation fixed by the king, Rama went into his residence but left immediately to see his mother in her inner apartment. There he beheld his mother in silk apparel engrossed in silent prayer (to the gods) for his royal fortune in the room meant for the worship of the gods. Hearing the welcome tidings of the installation of her beloved Rama, Sita too, had been brought in. Sumitra and Lakshmana had already arrived there. At that moment Kausalya was meditating with her eyes halfclosed. Sumitra, Lakshmana and Sita were attending on her. Having heard that installation of her son as heirapparent was planned in Pushya constellation, Kausalya was meditating upon the Supreme Person, Lord Visnu by controlling her breath (Pranayama). While she (Kausalya) was in that state of meditation, Rama approached her, offered reverential salutation and said these words of praise enhancing her joy:",
                "The king having instructed Rama summoned Vasistha, the priest and spoke to him about the coronation that was to take place on the following day Could you, O sage, whose wealth is asceticism go to Rama engaged in strict observance of vows and advise him along with Sita, my daughterinlaw to undertake fast for securing prosperity, fame and kingdom. Venerabel Vasistha, the best amongst the knowers of the Vedas, skilled in mantras and firm in his vows said to the king, 'Be it so.' Thereafter,  mounted on the best of the chariots befitting a brahmin, with horses harnesed he proceeded personally to the abode of Rama to ask him to undertake a fast in accompaniment with mantras preceding the installation ceremony. Venerabel Vasistha, the best amongst the knowers of the Vedas, skilled in mantras and firm in his vows said to the king, 'Be it so.' Thereafter,  mounted on the best of the chariots befitting a brahmin, with horses harnesed he proceeded personally to the abode of Rama to ask him to undertake a fast in accompaniment with mantras preceding the installation ceremony. Having crossed the three courtyards in the chariot, that foremost of ascetics (Vasistha) entered Rams's abode, shining like a mass of white clouds. Seeing the venerable sage(Vasitha) arrive, Rama quickly came out of his abode in great excitement to receive him with honour. Hastening with rapid strides, Rama approached the chariot of the sagacious Vasistha and personally helped him alight from the chariot. The family priest Vasistha also, having gratified him by enquiring about his welfare, said thus to Rama, who was humble and lovable: O Rama, welldisposed towards you, your father will declare you heirapparent. Do undertake fast today, along with Sita. Your father, king Dasaratha, will be pleased to coronate you as heirapparent early tomorrow morning as Nahusa did (to his son) Yayati. The ascetic (Vasistha) having thus spoken to Rama made him undertake fast along with Sita in accompaniment with sacred hymns. Thereafter, Vasistha, preceptor of the king duly honoured by the descendant of Kakutstha (Rama) left his abode. Rama also sat for a while in the company of his sweettongued friends and duly  honoured by them in every way took  leave  of them and entered his apartment.  The residence of Rama, full of cheerful men and women, looked splendid like a lake with fullblown lotuses flocked by multitudes of intoxicated birds. Vasistha thereafter emerged from the abode of Rama resembling a royal palace and beheld the highways filled with people. The royal highways in the city of Ayodhya were jammed on all sides with groups of curious people. The highways resembled the sea and the exultation of the multitudes, the roar that emanated from the clashing of waves. On that day, the thoroughfares of the city of Ayodhya, surrounded with (pleasure) gardens, were sprinkled with water and swept. The flags (on the top) of the houses were raised high.  Then all the people living in Ayodhya including women, children and aged alike wishing to see the coronation of Rama eagerly waited for the sunrise.  People were anxious to witness that great festival of Ayodhya which was to them (precious) like an ornament and a source of immense joy. The priest (Vasistha), beholding the overcrowded highway forced his passage through the crowds of men dividing them into two tracts and slowly entered the royal palace. Having ascended the royal palace resembling the peak of a mountain covered with white clouds, Vasistha approached the king like  Brihaspati meeting Indra. On seeing Vasistha the king descended from the throne and enquired whether he had performed the mission to which the ascetic replied affirmatively. All those present in the assembly with him (the king) also got up from their seats as he (Dasaratha) did and paid their obeisance to Vasistha. The king then, dully permitted by the preceptor, disposed the assembly of men and stepped into his inner apartment, like a lion entering the cave of a mountain. The king entered the inner apartment thronged with excellently attired women which looked like the palace of Mahendra. He resembled the beautiful Moon that illuminates the sky crowded with stars.       Thus ends the fifth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "With the family priest (Vasistha) gone, Rama had his bath, and with his mind under control came to Lord Narayana along with his largeeyed consort, Sita. (with an intention to worship him) Then holding the vessel containing havis on his head, he offered the oblations of  clarified butter into the sacred fire for Visnu in accordance with ritual practices. The son of the king (Rama) partook the remainder of the havis seeking his own welfare. With a restrained mind and a vow of silence, he meditated upon Lord Narayana and slept along with Vaidehi on a wellspread bed of kusha grass in the auspicious temple of lord Visnu. The son of the king (Rama) partook the remainder of the havis seeking his own welfare. With a restrained mind and a vow of silence, he meditated upon Lord Narayana and slept along with Vaidehi on a wellspread bed of kusha grass in the auspicious temple of lord Visnu. He got up (Rama) with one yama (three hours) of the night still left, and had his entire  residence decorated. Then (in the last watch of the night) hearing the pleasant words of bards and panegyrists he attended to early morning rites and intoned Gayatri with a concentrated mind. Clad in spotless silk garments, he extoled Lord Madhusudana (Visnu) with his head bowed low. He listened to the purificatory mantras recited by brahmins. And then the deep and sweet proclamations of 'This is an auspicious day' mingled with the sounds of trumpets reverberated (the city of) Ayodhya. The residents of Ayodhya were happy to hear that the scion of the Raghus (Rama) along with princess of Videha (Sita) had undertaken the fast. Having heard about the coronation of Rama, all the citizens began to decorate the city soon after daybreak. Banners of varying colours and flags were raised on the temples looking resplendent like peaks wreathed by a mass of white clouds, at the crossroads, on the thoroughfares, on the trees standing on avenues, on the towers and stalls of the merchants abounding in various kinds of merchandise, on prosperous and graceful houses of householders, in all public halls and on trees looking tall from a distance.

Troupes of actors and dancers entertained the people with songs pleasing to the mind and ears and their utterances were heard here and there. As the time for Rama's coronation was approaching, men in public squares and in private houses talked with one another about the consecration of Rama. Similarly children playing in groups in front of the houses also related to each other  stories regarding the coronation of Rama. On the occasion of Rama's coronation the highway, strewn with flowers and rendered fragrant with the burning of incense by the citizens looked glorious. In the same way lest night should fall (by the time the installation ceremony was completed), the streets were provided with lamps in the shape of trees to light them up. Thus the residents of Ayodhya decorated the city and eagerly waited for Rama's cornonation as heirapparent. Gathered in groups at public squares and in the assembly halls they conversed among themselves about the event, praising Dasaratha, the lord among men.

Gathered in groups at public squares and in the assembly halls they conversed among themselves about the event, praising Dasaratha, the lord among men. Oh having realised that he himself has grown old the highsouled king Dasaratha the veritable delight to the Ikshvaku race,  is going to coronate Rama in the kingdom. All of us are fortunate indeed that Rama who knows the world's high and low shall be our king, protector for a long time. This scion of the Raghus (Rama) is free from arrogance, is learned, righteous and affectionate towards his brothers as much as towards us. May the virtuous and sinless king Dasaratha live long by whose grace we are beholding (going to behold) Rama's coronation. Having heard about the coronation of Rama, villagers arrived from all directions and listened to the citizens conversing in this manner. The city was filled with villagers coming from different directions to behold Rama's coronation. The multitudes of men moving to and fro gave rise to a noise like the roar of the ocean enhanced by the violent speed (of the wind) on the full and new moon days. The city (of Ayodhya), resembling the abode of Indra, (Amaravati) crowded with villagers from all over wishing to witness it (the coronation of Rama), grew noisy and sparkled like the water of the ocean teeming with aquatic animals.       Thus ends the sixth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The family maid (Manthara) of Kaikeyi who had been living with her since her (Kaikeyi's) birth casually ascended the palace gleaming white like the Moon. Manthara beheld from that palace the whole of Ayodhya with its highways sprinkled with water and strewn with a lot of flowers. The city of Ayodhya was decorated with costly banners and pennants. The labyrinthine roads were crowded with people who had (finished) their headbath and were wandering at will. The temples with their doors painted white were reverberating with the chanting from the Vedas by the best of brahmins holding garlands and sweetmeats in their hands and with sounds of   all kinds of musical instruments. The city was filled with spirited horses and elephants. The bulls were bellowing and the cows were lowing. The citizens with great joy raised the penants encircling the city of Ayodhya. All this left Manthara astonished. The city of Ayodhya was decorated with costly banners and pennants.

The city was filled with spirited horses and elephants. The bulls were bellowing and the cows were lowing. The citizens with great joy raised the penants encircling the city of Ayodhya. All this left Manthara astonished. Seeing a royal  maid clad in white silk garment and standing not very far with her eyes expanded in delight Manthara enquired: Why is Rama's mother, forever interested in the accumulation of money gifting away her wealth to men with great joy? Why do the people look exceedingly happy? Tell me, what the king with great delight is proposing to do? Bursting with great joy, the royal maid related to the hunchback the great fortune awaiting the son of the Raghus (Rama). Tomorrow under the spell of the Pushya star, king Dasaratha will consecrate blameless Rama born in the race of Raghu as heirapparent (the maid said). Having heard these words of the royal maid, the hunchback became furious and speedily descended from that palace resembling the peak of mount Kailasa. The malevolent Manthara on fire with fury reached Kaikeyi lying upon her couch  and said: O senseless one, why are you lying down? Get up A great fear is gripping you. Why don't you realise that you are floating in a sea of perils. Though you appear to be your husband's darling, in reality he dislikes you. The good fortune you boast of indeed is unstable like the stream of a river in summer. At these harsh words of the furious, evileyed hunchback Kaikeyi   fell into great despondency. Kaikeyi said to the hunchback, O Manthara isn't all well with you? I can mark it from your dejected face how greatly distressed you feel, indeed. Hearing the words of Kaikeyi uttered in a gentle voice, wrathful Manthara skilled in speech, said: That hunchback feeling still more depressed in her (Kaikeyi's) interest and intending to cause in her despondency and distance Rama from her spoke out: O queen, your end is approaching, and it has no end and it is overwhelming. King Dasaratha is crowning Rama as heirapparent. Plunged in unfathomable fear and stricken with grief and tears I am here seeking your wellbeing and yet consumed as though by fire. O Kaikeyi, your sorrow will augment my sorrow. Your prosperity would mean my prosperity. There is no doubt about this. O queen, born in the royal family and being a king's consort why don't you realise the ruthless ways of statecraft? Your husband speaks morals publicly but in private he is deceitful. He speaks gently  but acts cruelly. Because of your innocent nature you are  beguiled by him. You do not understand this. When your husband approaches you he swears in meaningless, appeasing words. But today he is going to bestow benefit on Kausalya only. That evilminded one, having sent Bharata away to your relations house, is going to install Rama unhindered in the kingdom at dawn tomorrow. O innocent lady with the intention of doing good like a mother to your husband who is your enemy, you are holding on your lap a venomous serpent. King Dasaratha has done to you and to your son the same thing as a  snake or an enemy would do when ignored. O senseless lady, you are always accustomed to comfort. With deceitful words of appeasement that vicious one (King Dasaratha) is going to install Rama in the kingdom. You along with your son have been surely ruined. O enchantingeyed Kaikeyi, that appropriate time has come. Act quickly for your own wellbeing. Save yourself, your son and me too. Hearing the words of Manthara, Kaikeyi of charming countenance lying in her couch rose, full of joy, like the autumnal streak of the Moon's crescent. Filled with immense joy and wonder (at the news), Kaikeyi gifted a beauthful ornament to that hunchback. Kaikeyi, the best among the beauties, having given the ornament to Manthara, the hunchback, looked at her and said these words again: O Manthara, the news you have brought me is exceedingly pleasant. What more can I do for you? Here is the gift for one who brings good tidings. I do not see any distinction between Rama and Bharata as such. I am contented with Rama's consecration in the kingdom. O woman worthy of affection for me there is nothing greater and dearer than this news. I will grant you another reward better than this. Just ask for it.       Thus ends the seventh sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the  holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Annoyed with Kaikeyi and filled with rage and sorrow, Manthara discarded the ornament (gifted to her) and said these words: O foolish woman why do you display this misplaced happiness, little realising that you are in the midst of an ocean of sorrow? O queen at a time when this great misfortune has befallen you, you are rejoicing instead of feeling miserable. I am indeed laughing at you at heart. I pity your false notion. Will any wise woman rejoice at the prosperity of the son of a cowife who is like an enemy? This is like (courting) death. Since Bharata and Rama have equal claim to the kingdom, Bharata is a  source of fear for Rama. Having thought over this matter, I am dejected. Danger springs from one who is in fear. Lakshmana who wields a great bow has taken refuge with all his heart in Rama a descendant of Kakutstha dynasty. So does Satrughna in Bharata. O beautiful lady in order of birth, too, Bharata's right to the throne is just next (to  Rama's). While being younger, the chances of the other two (Lakshmana and Satrughna) are remote. Rama is learned in the duties of a kshatriya. He is wise enough to do what he should at the appropriate time. While reflecting the fate of your son, I am trembling with fear. Kausalya whose son is going to be coronated as heirapparent by eminent brahmins under Pushya  star tomorrow is fortunate, indeed. With folded palms like an attendant, you will have to serve that renowned Kausalya who is greatlly delighted by getting rid of her enemies. If you thus become her attendant along with us, your son will also develop slavishness towards Rama. All the women of Rama's (palace) will be delighted indeed. With the decline of Bharata, your daughtersinlaw will be deprived of all happiness. Having seen that morose Manthara speaking thus, Kaikeyi commended the virtues of Rama. Rama knows righteouness. He has been taught selfrestraint by elders. He is grateful and truthful. He is undefiled. He is the eldest son of the king. Therefore, he deserves to be the heirapparent (of the kingdom). Blessed with a long life, Rama will protect his brothers and the servants like a father. O hunchback, hearing Rama's coronation why are you aggrieved? After a hundred years of Rama's rule, Bharata, the best of men, will get the kingdom of his ancestors. Manthara, we have enjoyed prosperity in the past, we are enjoying it now and we will enjoy it in future. Then why are you aggrieved? For me, if Bharata is worthy of consideration Rama is worthier. He serves me even more (scrupulously) than he does Kausalya. If the kingdom is Rama's, it is also Bharata's, since Rama regards his brothers as his own self Having heard Kaikeyi's words Manthara was extremely unhappy. Heaving deep, hot sighs she said to Kaikeyi. You are sinking in the sea of sorrow widened with tears and troubles. But you are stupid enough not to perceive your own wellbeing. Rama, the scion of the Raghus, will become king. After Rama, his son will suceed him. O Kaikeyi, as for  Bharata, he will be debarred from royal succession (altogether). O lovely lady, not all the sons of the king will inherit the kingdom. If all of them are installed as kings, there will be great disorder. O Kaikeyi of beautiful limbs, for that reason kings bestow the governance of the kingdom either on the eldest or on other virtuous sons. O (Kaikeyi) dear cut off from royal succession as well as from its comforts, your son will become totally forlorn and brokenhearted. I am here to serve your interest. Nevertheless you do not understand me and you wish to confer gifts on me on the occasion of the prosperity of your cowife. Rama, having secured the thornless kingdom, will banish Bharata from the country or else send him to the other world. This is certain. Bharata has been sent by you right from his childhood to his maternal uncle's house.  Proximity creates friendship even amongst the inanimate objects. Satrughna who is obedient to Bharata has followed him. Like Lakshmana who has taken refuge in Rama, he has also resorted to Bharata. It is said that a tree intended to be cut down by those living on the forest is let off   due to entanglement of a kind of grass known as Ishika (thorny bushes) growing in its vicinity. (If Bharata had been at Ayodhya now, Dasaratha himself would have helped him. Just as Lakshmana protects Rama, Rama protects Lakshmana. Their brotherhood is renowned in the world like that of the Ashwins. Rama will do no harm to Lakshmana. As for Bharata, Rama will doubtless do him harm. Therefore let your son go to the forest straight from his uncle's palace only. That alone will please me. For you also this is highly beneficial. If Bharata secures the ancestral kingdom righteously, it will bring welfare to you and to your relations also. Your son, that young Bharata, is accustomed to comforts. He is a born enemy of Rama. How will he, deprived of all wealth, live under the control of Rama? Like the leader of an elephantherd attacked by a lion in the forest, Bharata is going to be oppressed by Rama. You should save him. Being fortunate (being the favourite wife of your husband) you slighted your cowife earlier with pride. How will she, Rama's mother (Kausalya) remain without retaliating? O lovely lady when Rama becomes the lord of this earth with its oceans, mountains and cities, then along with Bharata you will become miserable and fall into disgrace. When Rama obtains this earth, Bharata will be certainly ruined. Therefore, right now think of the kingdom for your son and the means of banishment for your enemy, Rama.       Thus ends the eighth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus spoken to, Kaikeyi, her face burning with anger, breathed a deep, hot sigh and said these words to Manthara: Today I shall at once banish Rama from here into the forest and get Bharata coronated as heirapparent without delay. O Manthara now see, for sure, Bharata and not Rama will get the kingdom by any means. Thus addressed by queen Kaikeyi, that evil minded Manthara said this to Kaikeyi  in order to spoil the interest of Rama: O Kaikeyi, what a joy I shall now tell you how your son Bharata alone will secure the kingdom. Listen to me: O Kaikeyi, don't you remember in your own interest what I'm going to tell you or are you hiding it, wishing to hear from me? O lovely Kaikeyi if it pleases you to hear from me, I shall tell you. Listen and think over it, too. After hearing Manthara's words, Kaikeyi got up a little from her wellspread bed and said this: O Manthara, tell me the means by which Bharata and not Rama will secure the kingdom in any circumstances. Thus addressed by the queen (Kaikeyi), the evileyed hunchback, Manthara, said with the intention to damage Rama's interest. O queen during the war between gods and asuras, your husband went with royal saints intending to render assistance to Indra, king of the gods, taking you along with him. He set off in the southern direction of Dandaka forest to a renowned city called Vaijayanta where asura Timidhvaja lived. O queen during the war between gods and asuras, your husband went with royal saints intending to render assistance to Indra, king of the gods, taking you along with him. He set off in the southern direction of Dandaka forest to a renowned city called Vaijayanta where asura Timidhvaja lived. That mighty asura wellknown as Sambara, capable of a hundred deceitful forms, challenged Indra to a battle which could not be conquered by hosts of gods. In that great battle, the rakshasas used to kill by force the warriors wounded by the weapons and those fast asleep during the night. There in that great battle the mightyarmed king Dasaratha lay wounded with weapons (used) by the asuras. O queen you had protected your husband by carrying him away from the battlefield when he lost his consciousness. He was saved by you. Once again you saved him when he lay wounded with weapons (hurled) by the asuras. O auspiciouslooking one out of gratitude he had granted two boons to you (for saving him on two occasions). O queen then you told your husband that whenever you desire, you will ask for those boons. The magnanimous king said, 'So be it'. O queen I did not know this indeed. Only you had related it to me earlier. Because of my affection towards you, I have retained it in my memory. (Now) prevent preparations for Rama's consecration by force. O queen I did not know this indeed. Only you had related it to me earlier. Because of my affection towards you, I have retained it in my memory. (Now) prevent preparations for Rama's consecration by force. Ask your husband for those two boons namely consecration of Bharata and banishment  of Rama for fourteen years. If Rama is banished into the forest for fourteen years your son will be firmly established in the kingdom by  affectionately winning the hearts of  the people. O Kaikeyi ,daughter of Ashwapati enter now the chamber of wrath like one in angry mood, wearing soiled garments and lie down on the bare ground. Immersed in grief and in tears, neither look at him (Dasaratha) nor even talk to him when you see him. No doubt, you have always been a beloved wife to your husband. For your sake the great king will even enter into the burning fire. The king is afraid of inciting your ire. When you are angry, he dare not look at your indignant countenance. Indeed he will forsake even his life for your pleasure. The king would not dare transgress your words. O wicked woman, recognise the power of your beauty. King Dasaratha may give you gems, pearls, gold and different kinds of precious stones. Do not pay them any attention. O fortunate Kaikeyi, make him recollect the two boons he had granted you in the war between gods and demons. You should not ignore your objective. When Dasaratha personally lifts you from the floor and  asks  you what you want  you may make him settle down and ask him for these boons: 'O best of kings exile Rama into the forest for fourteen years and make Bharata king of the land'. After Rama has been exiled into the forest for fourteen years your son grown strong and deeprooted will remain (king) for the rest of his life. O Devi demand Rama's exile as a boon. O lovely queen this way all the interests of your son will be fulfilled (protected). Thus, if Rama is exiled he will no longer be Rama (be able to cause delight to the people). Bharata will become king  with his enemy subdued. By the time Rama returns from the forest, your son (now) confident, would have become deep rooted by gaining the company of friends and the acceptability of the people. I think the proper time has come (to ask for the boons). Without fear refrain the king forcibly from his intention of installing Rama. Thus, having been made to accept the evil design as a beneficial objective, Kaikeyi  understood (the entire matter) and in delight spoke to Manthara. That Kaikeyi, even though endowed with sound foresight, expressed her sense of wonder at the words of the hunchback and chose a wrong path like a young (immature) girl. (She said) O hunchback, I never knew that you can speak such excellent words or decide  things intelligently. You are the best among the hunchbacks of this world. O hunchback you alone always show interest in my affairs and seek my welfare. I might not have known the intended (deceptive) action of the king (without you). There are many hunchbacks in this world, terribly ugly with their bodies misshaped and crooked. But you look beautiful like a lotus bent by the breeze. Your breasts are thick and are as high as your shoulders. Beneath them lies your belly with its beautiful navel (waist) looking slender as if out of bashfulness. You have full hips, round and plump breasts. Your countenance equals the bright moon. How passionate you look, Manthara Your hips, glitter with the jingling girdle. Strong are the  calfs of your legs and long are your feet. O Manthara when clad in silk garment you walk in front of me with your heavy thighs, you look like a female royal swan. In you reside a thousand deceitful means more than all the thousand mayas (tricks) of Sambara, king of the asuras, was capable of. Your clever thoughts, magic powers and also the skills of kshatriyas are stored in your huge hump which is as wide as the hub of a chariot wheel. O hunchback, with Rama gone to the forest and Bharata consecrated, I shall drape this hump with a golden garland. O Manthara, when my objective is accomplished and I am fully satisfied, I will smear your hump with the best of refined liquid gold. O Manthara, I shall get a tilaka made of gold for your auspicious, lovely face and shall also order exquisite ornaments (for you). You shall move about wearing lovely garments like a goddess. With a peerless countenance, as if challenging the Moon and feeling proud, you will attain a state of eminence amidst your enemies. You shall move about wearing lovely garments like a goddess. With a peerless countenance, as if challenging the Moon and feeling proud, you will attain a state of eminence amidst your enemies. Other hunchbacks adorned with all sorts of ornament shall also serve you in the same manner as you are serving me. Flattered in this manner, Manthara addressed Kaikeyi who was lying on a white couch and looking like a flaming fire on the sacrificial altar: O fortunate one construction of a dike is not undertaken after the water has flowed down. Act before the king to the best of your interest. That beautiful, largeeyed Kaikeyi, puffed with the pride of her intoxicating beauty, encourged and influenced by the words of that hunchback, entered the chamber of wrath. She cast off her highly precious pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands (of rupees) and other costly, beautiful ornaments. Thereafter that goldenhued Kaikeyi lay down on the floor and said to Manthara: That beautiful, largeeyed Kaikeyi, puffed with the pride of her intoxicating beauty, encourged and influenced by the words of that hunchback, entered the chamber of wrath. She cast off her highly precious pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands (of rupees) and other costly, beautiful ornaments. Thereafter that goldenhued Kaikeyi lay down on the floor and said to Manthara: That beautiful, largeeyed Kaikeyi, puffed with the pride of her intoxicating beauty, encourged and influenced by the words of that hunchback, entered the chamber of wrath. She cast off her highly precious pearl necklace worth many hundreds of thousands (of rupees) and other costly, beautiful ornaments. Thereafter that goldenhued Kaikeyi lay down on the floor and said to Manthara: O hunchback, tell the king, either Bharata shall secure the kingdom on Rama's departure to the forest or else I will die here. I do not aspire for gold, nor gems nor ornaments. If Rama is installed, that will be the end of my life. Addressing queen Kaikeyi, the mother of Bharata, with extremely powerful words, that hunchback again made these utterances beneficial to Bharata and detrimental to Rama: It is true that if Rama secures this kingdom, you along with your son are bound to suffer. O auspicious one, hence act in a way your son Bharata will be installed. Repeatedly struck down by that hunchback's arrowsharp words greatly grieved queen Kaikeyi was inflamed against the king. Laying her hands on the chest again and again and expressing her amazement, she praised that hunchback. Tell the king that he will see either the fulfilment of Bharata's desire after Rama is banished into the forest for a long period or me gone to Yama's abode. If Rama does not go from here to the forest, I want neither a bed nor garlands nor sandalpaste nor unguents nor food nor water nor even life. Saying these ruthless words, that lovely Kaikeyi cast off all her ornaments like a fallen  'kinnara' woman, and lay down on the floor with the carpet removed. Thus queen Kaikeyi's face enveloped by the darkness of violent anger and her body stripped of all valuable ornaments, she lay restless, looking like the dark sky without stars.       Thus ends of the ninth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Perversely advised by the extremely sinful hunchback the queen (Kaikeyi) lay down on the ground like a kinnari struck as though by a poisonous arrow. The intelligent, beautiful lady (Kaikeyi), having correctly decided the strategy in her mind, slowly unfolded everything to Manthara. That beautiful wretch (Kaikeyi) impressed by the words of Manthara heaved deep, hot sighs like a female serpent and  thought for a while about the means of bringing happiness to herself. Manthara, Kaikeyi's friend, too, driven by a strong desire to fulfil her resolve was highly pleased and on hearing the firm determination of Kaikeyi, felt as if the accomplishment of the objective was at hand. Then Kaikeyi finally took a firm decision. With a soiled body and a frowning face she lay down on the floor. Thereafter Kaikeyi flung away her multicoloured garlands along with her costly ornaments on to the ground. All the garlands and ornaments she scattered adorned the floor like the stars (illumining) the sky. Tightly fastening her hair into a single braid and wearing soiled clothes, she lay down in the chamber of wrath in a lifeless state like a kinnari. The king issued orders for Rama's installation ceremony, and taking leave of his close associates entered the palace.                        . Aware of the fact that Rama's installation ceremony was known to everybody by then he who had subdued his senses entered the inner apartment to convey it to one worthy of such pleasant news. The illustrious king entered the excellent abode of Kaikeyi like the Moon entering the mouth of Rahu in a sky overcast with pale clouds. The maharaja entered the inner apartment of Kaikeyi's prosperous abode filled with parrots and peacocks, reverberating with cries of kraunchas and swans and sounds of musical instruments attended with hunchbacks and dwarfs decorated with champak and ashoka trees, bowers surrounded with creepers, picturegalleries, altars and sofas embellished with ivory, gold and silver. It was shining with pools and trees bearing flowers and fruits in all seasons. Various kinds of food, drinks and eatables were kept ready. With excellent decorations that abode of Kaikeyi resembled heaven. (But) the king did not see his beloved Kaikeyi in her best bed.

With excellent decorations that abode of Kaikeyi resembled heaven. (But) the king did not see his beloved Kaikeyi in her best bed. Charged with passion and seeking carnal pleasure, the king became dejected when he did not see his beloved wife. He enquired about her. Never before had queen Kaikeyi missed his time of arrival. Nor had the king ever entered her empty apartment. Having entered her apartment, the king, unaware of that foolish Kaikeyi's selfish design enquired her whereabouts as usual. Thereafter, the frightened doorkeeper with folded palms said O monarch the queen in a hot mood has rushed into the chamber of wrath. Hearing the words of the doorkeeper, the melancholic king grieved all the more with his senses agitated and unstable. The lord of the earth (Dasaratha) saw her (Kaikeyi) lying down on the floor of the chamber of wrath in an unbecoming manner and felt as if consumed by grief. The guileless, old king beheld his youthful wife who was dearer to him than his own life, filled with deceitful  intentions. She looked like a severed creeper, like a goddess fallen down, like a 'Kinnari' thrown down on earth, like an 'apsarasa' slipped from heaven, like an illusion torn, like a female deer tied down.

She looked like a severed creeper, like a goddess fallen down, like a 'Kinnari' thrown down on earth, like an 'apsarasa' slipped from heaven, like an illusion torn, like a female deer tied down. Like a mighty sheelephant caressing her cow wounded with a poisoned arrow in the forest, he caressed her lovingly. With a mind extremely terrified yet passionate, he caressed his lotuseyed wife with his hands, and said: O auspicious queen, I do not know whether your anger is directed at me. I do not know the cause of your anger. By whom have you been offended or disrespected? Why are you lying in the dust? This is causing me great sorrow. While I am here favourably disposed towards you, why are you lying down on the floor like one possessed by an evil spirit? Why are you afflicting my mind? O lovely one there are, to my best satisfaction, expert physicians in all branches (of medical science). They will restore your health. Tell me your ailment. On whom do you wish to bestow favour? Who has caused you displeasure? To whom should I grant favour now? To whom should I cause great displeasure? O queen shed no tears. Drain not your health. Ask me, and I shall slay one who should not be slain or release one who should be slain. I shall make a poor man rich and a wealthy man poor. (Tell me who are such people). O queen shed no tears. Drain not your health. Ask me, and I shall slay one who should not be slain or release one who should be slain. I shall make a poor man rich and a wealthy man poor. (Tell me who are such people). My kins and I are under your control. I will make no effort to go even a little  against your wishes. If you want to do anything even if it means sacrificing my life, I shall do it. Since you know my strength, it does not behove you to doubt me. I swear on my  merits. I will do whatever pleases you. My authority on the land is extended till such places the wheel of any chariot rotates such as the regions in the east, SindhuSauvira areas, Saurashtra, Southern regions, Banga, Anga, Magadha states, Matsya kingdom and KasiKosala countries which are prosperous places. My authority on the land is extended till such places the wheel of any chariot rotates such as the regions in the east, SindhuSauvira areas, Saurashtra, Southern regions, Banga, Anga, Magadha states, Matsya kingdom and KasiKosala countries which are prosperous places. There wealth and foodgrains, sheep and goats and many things are produced. O Kaikeyi, ask whichever of these you wish. O lady why do you exert yourself? Arise, arise. O charming Kaikeyi, tell me the cause of your fear. I will dispel it just as the Sun dispels morning mists. Thus spoken to, she (Kaikeyi) breathed a sigh of relief. Intending to tell him the unpleasant thing (which was in her mind), she began tormenting her husband all the more.       Thus ends  the tenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "To the ruler of the earth (the king), struck by the darts of Kamadeva and overtaken by passion Kaikeyi spoke (these) dreadful words. O king I have neither been offended nor disregarded by any one, but I have a purpose which you should fulfil. If you are inclined to accomplish my desire, then promise me that you will fulfil them. Thereafter I shall reveal it to you. The mighty king steeped in passion gently held Kaikeyi's hair in his hands  and with a clear, bright smile said: O proud lady, don't you know there exists for me no woman dearer than you and      no man other than Rama who is the best among men. I swear in the name of the scion of the Raghu dynasty, the invincible, broadminded Rama, the best among men worthy of long life. Tell me what you have in mind. O Kaikeyi, in the name of Rama without seeing whom I, for sure, cannot live a momment, I swear I will fulfil your desire. O Kaikeyi I wish the best among men Rama well.Even at the expense of my life or the lives of the rest of my sons I swear in his name I shall fulfil your wish. O gentle lady my heart is sinking. Touch my heart and deliver me from distress. O Kaikeyi considering all this, tell me what you think is good. You know fully the authority you wield over me. Therefore, it does not behove you to doubt me. I swear on my acquired merits that I shall do whatever pleases you. Bent upon her interests, the queen cheered and expressed in unutterable words her premeditated  wish which had no alternative. Delighted by the words (of the king), Kaikeyi disclosed him her highly dreadful wish which entered her mind like a sudden visitation of death: You are repeatedly swearing to grant me boons. Let the thirtythree crore gods headed by  the firegod, listen. Let the Moon and the Sun, the sky, the planets, night and day, the (ten) quarters the world, gandharvas, rakshasas, this earth, the nocturnal spirits all beings, family deities of every house and all other beings listen to your words of promise. Let the Moon and the Sun, the sky, the planets, night and day, the (ten) quarters the world, gandharvas, rakshasas, this earth, the nocturnal spirits all beings, family deities of every house and all other beings listen to your words of promise. King Dasaratha who is true to his vows, heroic and knows the ways of righteousness is granting me boons with a wellcomposed mind. Let all the gods  stand witness to this (declared Kaikeyi). Clasping the great archer, the infatuated king, conferer of boons and flattering him (to the top of her bent), the queen said: O king, recall the event that happened long ago in the war between gods and asuras where the enemy destroyed all your forces except your life. O king, I rescued you there. Since I was alert to protect you, you granted me two boons. O protector of the earth, O king, honest in keeping promises, I (now) seek those two boons which were reserved as deposits. The boons you have vowed to give shall rightfully be given to me. If not, disgraced by you I shall give up my life right away. The king now came under the control of Kaikeyi by his own words like a deer that jumps into the trap for its own destruction. Thereafter, she said to the infatuated king who had promised to confer her boons, O lord of the earth, O king, right now I shall speak to you about the two boons granted by you. Listen to my words. Preparations for Rama's consecration have been made. With these very materials for installation, my son Bharata should be consecrated. Then in the war between gods and asuras, O lord, pleased with me you have promised a second boon and the time has come to grant it. Consigned to the Dandaka forest for fourteen years, clad in bark and deer skin and wearing matted hair, Rama shall live like an ascetic. Let Bharata be princeregent without any rivals. This is my great desire. I am asking for an already granted boon. Let me see Rama's departure to the forest today itself. Let Bharata be princeregent without any rivals. This is my great desire. I am asking for an already granted boon. Let me see Rama's departure to the forest today itself. O king of kings, by being true to your vow, protect your race, character and lineage. Those sages whose ascetism is their wealth maintain that there is no merit superior to truthfulness which can confer man a place in the other world.       Thus ends the eleventh sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After hearing the dreadful words of Kaikeyi, the maharaja (Dasaratha), engulfed in grief, was extremely distressed for a moment. ' Is this a dream? Or a hallucination of the mind? Or some foreboding evil I am going to experience or a malady of my mind'? (wondered Dasaratha) The King absorbed in such thoughts did not get solace. He was startled  and distressed like a deer beholding a tigress. He had long lost the senses struck by the (ruthless) words of Kaikeyi. He sank down upon the bare floor heaving deep sighs like  a venomous serpent lying confined in a circle. 'What a pity' said the king with indignation and with his senses overwhelmed  by sorrow  fell into a stupor again. The King absorbed in such thoughts did not get solace.

He sank down upon the bare floor heaving deep sighs like  a venomous serpent lying confined in a circle. 'What a pity' said the king with indignation and with his senses overwhelmed  by sorrow  fell into a stupor again. Regaining his consciousness after a long time, the king in deep grief and with eyes as though burning in anger looked at  Kaikeyi  and said: O woman of cruel and sinful nature, you are bent on destroying this family. What harm has been done to you  by Rama or by me? Then Rama was conducting himself in relation to you as his own mother, for what purpose are you seeking injustice to such a person? In my ignorance I brought home for my selfdestruction a king's daughter who was like a venomous female serpent. When all living beings of this world are extoling the virtues of Rama, for what crime should I abandon my beloved son? I shall give up Kausalya or Sumitra or all my wealth or even my own life but I cannot leave Rama who is devoted to his father. When I see my firstborn , I experience supreme delight. But if I do not see him, my life loses its meaning. This world can exist without the Sun or crops (can be grown) without water but without Rama, life would not exist in my body. O lady of evil intentions, enough of this. Give up your resolve. Here I touch your feet with my head. Be pleased with me. O sinful one why have you got this most dreadful thought? Do you want to know  my likes or dislikes about Bharata? Let them be so.But speaking of Rama earlier, you used to say, 'Rama is my eldest son. He is noble and foremost in discharging his  duties.' Such sweet words could not have been said only to please me. O sinful one why have you got this most dreadful thought? Do you want to know  my likes or dislikes about Bharata?

Let them be so.But speaking of Rama earlier, you used to say, 'Rama is my eldest son. He is noble and foremost in discharging his  duties.' Such sweet words could not have been said only to please me. Further you are tormented with sorrow under the influence of others' insinuations. You are causing me great pain by entering the empty chamber of wrath. O queen, till now you had a moral sense. With your mind debased (now), a very great immorality has infected the  Ikshvaku race. O largeeyed lady, you have never done anything improper or unpalatable towards me in the past. Therefore I do not  believe your words. O childish one, you used to tell me several times that Rama is as dear to you as the highsouled Bharata. O lady how do you wish this righteous and illustrious Rama to dwell in the forest for fourteen years? Why do you want Rama who is so tender and a firm follower of dharma to dwell in the highly dreadful forest? O woman with attractive eyes, why do you want Rama who is so charming and serving you to be exiled to a distant place? Rama is doing greater service to you than Bharata. Therefore, I do not find any reason for you to have a special love for Bharata. There are many thousands of women and attendants (in the inner apartment), but who will do greater service and honour you more than Rama, the best among men in the execution of your orders. The best among men, Rama has won the trust of the inhabitants of the country by securing their affection with a pure heart and by doing acts dear to them. Therefore, neither a word of blame nor reproach applies to this scion of the Raghu dynasty (Rama). The best among men, Rama has won the trust of the inhabitants of the country by securing their affection with a pure heart and by doing acts dear to them. Therefore, neither a word of blame nor reproach applies to this scion of the Raghu dynasty (Rama). Rama is a hero who wins over the people by his truthfulness, the poor by charity, the preceptors by his service and the enemies in the battle by the power of  his bow. Truth, munificence, asceticism, renunciation, purity, uprightness, learning and service to his superiors all those (virtues) are firmly planted in this descendant of the Raghus. How do you, O Devi, wish to harm Rama who is endowed with uprightness, who resembles the gods and in lustre to great ascetics? How can I, for your sake, speak harsh to my beloved Rama who uses pleasing words to the people of the world, and never an unpleasant word which I can recall? Where is the refuge for me without him in whom dwell forgiveness, forbearance, renunciation, truthfulness, righteousness, gratefulness and also nonviolence towards all living beings? O Kaikeyi, you should show mercy to this wretched, old man on the verge of death, wailing pitifully. I shall give you all that can be secured on this earth bounded by the ocean. Show no anger. O Kaikeyi I bow to you with folded palms. I touch your feet, too. Be the saviour of Rama. Let no sin taint me here (in this life). Then the fierce Kaikeyi used fiercer words in reply to the king who was tormented with grief and filled with tears, senses switched off, head reeling, overwhelmed with pain, beseeching again and again to ferry him across the ocean of sorrow as quickly as possible: Then the fierce Kaikeyi used fiercer words in reply to the king who was tormented with grief and filled with tears, senses switched off, head reeling, overwhelmed with pain, beseeching again and again to ferry him across the ocean of sorrow as quickly as possible: O valiant king, if you repent like this after having given two boons, how will you talk about your righteousness on this earth? O knower of righteousness when innumerable rajarshis assemble and ask you on this what answer will you give? Will you say, 'To such a Kaikeyi by whose mercy I am alive and by whom I was protected, I have broken the promise given'? O king, right now having given two boons, you are speaking otherwise. You are bringing blemish to kings (of the Ikshwaku race) (King) Saibya gave his own flesh to the hawk in the conflict between the hawk and the pigeon. (King) Alarka gave his eyes (to a blind man) and attained the highest state. Having made the vow (to the gods), the ocean does not advance beyond the shore. Recollect the history of the earlier kings and do not make the vow false. O wickedminded one, deserting righteousness and installing Rama in the kingdom, you want to enjoy life with Kausalya everafter? Whether righteous or unrighteous, true or false, there is no deviation from what you have promised to me. If Rama is coronated I will die while as you are watching right in your presence today itself by drinking excessive poison. If I were to see Rama's mother receiving homage from everybody even for a day, I shall prefer my death. O king, I swear on Bharata and on my own life that nothing less than Rama's banishment will satisfy me. Kaikeyi, having spoken to this extent remained silent. She heeded not the lament of the king. Having heard of the highly unfair demands by Kaikeyi for Rama's exile to the forest and Bharata's prosperity (enthronement), the king was dumbstruck for a while with his senses agitated. He did not speak to Kaikeyi. The unhappy king intently fixed his gaze at his beloved queen speaking unpleasant words charged with grief and anguish, unpleasant to the heart like the dreadful thunderbolt. The unhappy king intently fixed his gaze at his beloved queen speaking unpleasant words charged with grief and anguish, unpleasant to the heart like the dreadful thunderbolt. Reflecting on the determination of the queen and her dreadful vow, the king sighed and cried, 'O Rama' and then fell down like a tree severed. The lord of the earth (Dasaratha) became like a man with the mind deranged, like a sick man behaving to the contrary, like a serpent with its energy drained (through mantra). The king addressed Kaikeyi in humble words saying, Why did you exhibit this unfortunate act apparently beneficial to you? You are not ashamed of saying this like one whose faculties are possessed by an evil spirit. I never knew earlier when you were young that you possessed such perverse behaviour. But now I perceive the reverse (of what I knew). You are asking for a boon that Bharata should be enthroned in the kingdom while Rama should live in the forest. From where did you get this apprehension? If you wish to do good to your husband, to the world and also to Bharata, refrain from this illusory thought. O cruel one, O woman of sinful resolve, O vile (creature), O woman of evil deeds, what  wrong or sin do you really see in Rama or in me. Depriving Rama, Bharata in no way will occupy the kingdom because in the matter of righteousness I think he is superior even to Rama. While instructing Rama to go to the forest, how can I look at his face, pale like the eclipsed moon? I have taken this decision in consultation with friends to install Rama. How can I see such a decision being reversed like a retreating army defeated by enemies? Kings from different quarters have already arrived and they will say, How did this ignorant descendant of the Ikshakus (Dasaratha) rule this kingdom for such a long time? I have taken this decision in consultation with friends to install Rama. How can I see such a decision being reversed like a retreating army defeated by enemies? Kings from different quarters have already arrived and they will say, How did this ignorant descendant of the Ikshakus (Dasaratha) rule this kingdom for such a long time? When several virtuous and learned elders ask me about Rama, what shall I tell them? If I tell the truth 'Tortured by Kaikeyi, I have sent Rama to the forest', none will believe it  and they will consider it untruth. If Rama takes refuge in the forest, what will Kausalya say to me? Having committed such an unpleasant act, what reply can I give her? Sweetspoken Kausalya who always cherishes my welfare. who has given me my beloved son, who has served me like an attendant, a friend, a wife, a sister and a mother deserved courteous treatment from me, but  because of you, she never received due attention from me. Sweetspoken Kausalya who always cherishes my welfare. who has given me my beloved son, who has served me like an attendant, a friend, a wife, a sister and a mother deserved courteous treatment from me, but  because of you, she never received due attention from me. I have done many favours to you. Like a sick person afflicted by eating rice mixed with unwholesome curry, those acts of kindness are burning me now. In seeing the insult meted out to Rama and his journey to the forest, how will frightened  Sumitra  have confidence in me? Alas Sita will listen in a pitiable state the two unpleasant events namely my death and  Rama's exile to the foest. What a pity Vaidehi, lamenting like a Kinnari forsaken by a Kinnara on the Himalayan slopes, will cause death to me. With Rama living in the wilderness and Sita crying, I do not hope to survive for long, indeed. O Devi you will certainly rule the kingdom as a widow along with your son. (But) I do not wish to live after Rama is exiled. Like people regarding wine mixed with poison as fine before drinking it, I had a firm belief that you were a chaste woman, but while you who look extremely beautiful you are actually not so. You used to console me with so many words pleasing but untrue and you killed me like a hunter getting the deer trapped and slaughtered through the melody of music. Respectable people on the highway will certainly say 'He sold away his son' and censure me as a mean person like a brahmin consuming liquor. What suffering What a calamity that I am made to put up with your words. I am subject to this suffering may be as expiation for the sin formerly committed. O wretch I protected you in my folly for a long time through ignorance, like a rope preserved which turned out to be a noose to hang me with. While sporting with you, I did not realize you were death incarnate. Like a child handling a black cobra I caressed you. Wicked I am, I have made that magnanimous Rama fatherless. This world of living beings is certainly entitled to condemn me. (They will say), 'Alas how utterly foolish and lustful is king Dasaratha who is sending his beloved son to the forest for the sake of a woman'. '(Rama) already emaciated by observing vows related to ritual and celibacy in compliance with the orders of the preceptors has to undergo hardships again at a time when he should enjoy pleasures (of life)'. My son Rama will not say a second word to me, if I tell him 'Go to the forest'.He will say, 'Certainly so'. If this scion of the Raghu race (Rama) urged to go to the forest acts against my order, it will be welcome but my son will not do it. The descendant of the Raghus (Rama) who is pure in thought will not come to know my intention. Therefore if I tell him 'Go to the forest,' he will say, 'Certainly so'. If Rama goes to the forest, the god of death will conduct me to his abode, for condemned by the entire world, I shall not be forgiven (even by Yama). With me dead and Rama, the best among men, banished, what harmful acts are you contemplating against my wellwishers? If queen Kausalya loses me, Rama, Lakshmana and Satrughna will follow me into death, unable to bear the grief. O Kaikeyi consign Kausalya, Sumitra, me and my three sons into hell and be happy. You will rule undisturbed the Ikshvaku race honoured for its divine virtues. Now abandoned by me and Rama it will be afflicted with grief. If Rama's exile is approved by Bharata, then let him not perform my funeral rites after my death. O my enemy, O wicked Kaikeyi, after Rama, the foremost of men, has left for the forest your desires will be fulfilled. And after my death, you as a widow along with your son will rule the kingdom. O my enemy, O wicked Kaikeyi, after Rama, the foremost of men, has left for the forest your desires will be fulfilled. And after my death, you as a widow along with your son will rule the kingdom. You lived in my palace under the name of a princess. You have brought me, for sure, unparalleled dishonour and disgrace. Everybody will look upon me with contempt as if I have committed a sinful act. How will my son, Rama, who used to ride on chariots, elephants and horses roam the wilderness barefoot? How will my son for whom the cooks with kundalas in their ears used to proudly prepare enough food and beverages subsist on astringent, pungent, bitter wild fruits and roots? How will my son for whom the cooks with kundalas in their ears used to proudly prepare enough food and beverages subsist on astringent, pungent, bitter wild fruits and roots? How will he who was habituated to wearing expensive apparels and to (royal) comforts over a long period of time live (sleep) on the ground, putting on saffron robes? Whose are these dreadful words, this inconceivable plan of Rama's exilement and Bharata's enthronement? A woman means one who secretly harms others. This is shameful indeed. They always seek selfish interests. I do not say this of all women, only of Bharata's mother. O malicious one, O covetous one, O cruel one, O woman determined to torment me, what fault have you seen in Rama who is always devoted to the welfare of others? This entire world will be inflamed to see Rama plunged in adversity. Fathers will abandon their sons. Wives, attached to their husbands, will forsake them. When I see my son, handsome and welladorned like the son of a celestial deity, coming towards me, I rejoice. Even his very sight makes me grow young again. Nature's activity will continue even without the Sun or even if  Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, sends no rain but none will live to see Rama departing to the forest. This is my conviction. Alas I carried all along on my lap a highly poisonous female snake I gave you shelter while you were like death .This delusion is the cause of my ruin.You were my enemy. You wished me harm. You wished my destruction. With Rama and Lakshmana withdrawn from me, my kinsmen killed, let Bharata along with you rule the city and the kingdom causing delight to my enemies. O cruelhearted woman, you strike one in adversity. Why are your teeth with which you are now speaking (such harsh words) do not fall to the ground, broken into a thousand fragments? How do you find fault with Rama who does not utter even one harmful or unpalatable word, who does not know how to use harsh words, and who speaks pleasingly and who is always honoured for his virtues? O obloquy on the house of Kekaya, you may grieve or burn yourself in the fire, or get  destroyed. Even if you fall down on earth broken into a thousand pieces I will not act on your terrible, harmful words. You are like a knife. You always speak palatable lies. You are  malevolent. You are a destroyer of your own race. You displease the mind. You are intent on burning down all the links of my heart. I cannot bear to see you alive in this world. There is no life for me without my son (Rama). What to speak of happiness again? Where is pleasure for a selfrespecting man like me? O queen, it does not behove you to do this harmful act. I will touch your feet. Show pity on me. The king, with his heart in the grip of a woman, wailing like an orphan tried to reach her feet, exceeding the limit of selfrespect but, unable to touch them as she pulled them apart, he collapsed like a sick man.       Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The maharaja lying on the floor resembled (king) Yayati fallen from heaven after his merits (earned earlier) were exhausted. He neither deserved nor was accustomed to such (humiliating) treatment. Fearless Kaikeyi ,the incarnate of misfortune having accomplished her purpose, displyaing feigned fear, urged the king again (without inhibition), about the boons: The maharaja lying on the floor resembled (king) Yayati fallen from heaven after his merits (earned earlier) were exhausted. He neither deserved nor was accustomed to such (humiliating) treatment. Fearless Kaikeyi ,the incarnate of misfortune having accomplished her purpose, displyaing feigned fear, urged the king again (without inhibition), about the boons: O great king you used to boast that you always speak the truth and are steadfast in your vows. Why are you now seeking to avoid granting me this boon? Thus addressed by Kaikeyi, king Dasaratha flew into a temper for a while, and then as if in a state of delirium, replied: Alas O ignoble woman, my enemy, your desire would be fulfilled after Rama, the foremost among men is exiled and I am dead. You will be happy thereafter Even in heaven when the gods enquire about the welfare of Rama how will I convince them about his banishment repudiating the fact? What a catastrophe If I tell the truth, 'To please Kaikeyi I have sent Rama to the forest', none will believe it  and will consider it untruth. When I was issueless, I obtained mighty and valiant Rama with great effort as a son. How can I banish him? How can I exile Rama, whose eyes resemble lotus petals, who is learned, who has subdued his anger and who is always full of forgiveness? Rama with a charming personality has a complexion like the blue lotus. He has long arms (with immense strength). How can I banish him to Dandaka forest? Rama deserves happiness not suffering. How can I  bear to see such a sagacious Rama undergoing distress? If death comes to me right now I shall be very happy because I will not have to inflict suffering on Rama who does not deserve it. O cruel, malevolent Kaikeyi, why do you propose such a harmful act against Rama who has truth as his prowess and who is so dear to me? Certainly, you will get unparalleled infamy and disgrace in this world. While Dasaratha was thus lamenting with a distracted mind, the Sun set and night fell. For the king who was in deep anguish and in tears the night appeared dark even though it was adorned with the lunar orb. The old king Dasaratha, heaving hot sighs, started lamenting pitiably fixing his gaze at the sky like the sick: 'O auspiciouslooking Night adorned with stars, I do not wish to see the dawn. O gentle night, be kind to me I pray with folded hands'. 'Or, pass off quickly. I do not want to see this merciless, malicious Kaikeyi who is the cause of this great misfortune'. Having said this, the king spoke again with folded hands to Kaikeyi in order to appease her: O gentle queen, I am an old man and my life is almost over. I am a wretch devoted to you. I am a man of good conduct. Do me this favour especially as I am  king. O lady with fair hips, I hope whatever I have said has not been a cry in the (empty) sky. O young lady show me this favour. Surely you are kindhearted. O queen with beautiful, dark eyelashes, show pity on me. Let Rama receive this unbounded kingdom through you and you acquire fame. O lady with heavy hips, charming eyes and a beautiful face, do this favour to me, to Rama, to the world, to all the preceptors and to Bharata too. The king with a clean heart, whose eyes had been rendered red with weeping wailed  piteously. Even after hearing it, that malicious woman full of wicked thoughts did not act upon his word. Seeing his dear wife not pleased (despite his pleadings) and urging him, to the contrary, for the banishment of his son, the king overcome with grief fell down unconscious on the floor. The night passed off with the highminded king lamenting this way and heaving deep sighs. When he got up, the eminent king stopped (the panegyrists) awakening him.       Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The evil woman (Kaikeyi) said to the king of the Ikshvaku race who lay unconscious on the floor writhing and tormented with grief on account of his son. (Kaikeyi said) What is this? After hearing my response to the promised boon, why are you lying down on the floor dejected as if you had committed a sin? It behoves you to maintain your status. Those conversant with righteousness say that truth is a great virtue. By following the truth, I have enlightened you about your duty. O King O lord of the earth (king) Saibya attained the highest state by offering his own body to a hawk in accordance with his promise. In the same way the lustrous king Alarka, on being solicited by a brahmin who was an adept in the Vedas, plucked his own eyes and gave them to him without hesitation. The ocean, lord of rivers, even when (tidal) time comes does not cross the shore in obedience to truth. Truth is Brahman in one word. Righteousness is firmly established in truth. Truth is the imperishable Vedas. The supreme state can be attained by means of truth. O excellent one, if your mind is firmly fixed in righteousness, then by following it fulfil the boon granted to me.You are the bestower of boons indeed You must uphold righteousness. I also urge you to do that. Send your son Rama to the forest. I am repeating this statememt thrice. O noble one, if you do not fulfil the agreement, it will mean I have been abandoned by you. (Therefore) I will give up my life in your presence. In this way urged by Kaikeyi without fear or hesitation, he (Dasaratha), like Bali unable to release himself from the noose cast by Indra (through Vamana), could not get out of the noose of promise. Like a bullock, restlessly moving between the wheels and the yoke, Dasaratha's heart started beating wildly and his face turned pale. The king was unable to see with his eyes overwhelmed (with tears). Gaining with great difficulty a firm footing and courage he addressed Kaikeyi: O wicked woman, I held your hand amid chantings of mantras with the sacred fire (as witness). I now disown that hand, you and your son begotten by me. O queen the night has departed and the Sun is about to rise. The preceptors now will definitely ask me to hasten for the consecration. With the materials already collected for the consecration of Rama he will perform my funeral rite of offering water to the dead. O woman of inauspicious practices, since you are obstructing Rama's coronation, you and your son shall not perform my funeral rite of offering water to the dead. Having seen people formerly enjoying happiness, I cannot see them again with their downcast, cheerless faces devoid of all happiness. While the king was thus speaking to her (Kaikeyi) that holy night resplendent with the Moon and the stars, the day dawned. Thereafter, Kaikeyi of sinful conduct and skilful in the use of words, rendered senseless by wrath, again addressing the king in harsh words said: O king, why are you speaking these painful, poisonous words? What is this? It behoves you to summon your son Rama who does not expearience this pain. Only after you have  installed my son in the kingdom and sent Rama to the forest and  made me free from rivals, you shall have your duty fulfiled. The king who was very much incited by her words, like a horse of the best breed whipped by the lash, replied to Kaikeyi: I am bound by bond of righteousness. My intellect is destroyed. I wish to see my beloved, virtuous firstborn, Rama. The night dawned. Ths Sun rose. The auspicious time with the sacred star in (favourable) conjunction arrived. The virtuous Vasistha, surrounded by his disciples, soon entered the best of abodes with the articles collected (for the ceremony). The night dawned. Ths Sun rose.

The streets in Ayodhya were swept and sprinkled with water, decorated with excellent flags, strewn with flowers of variegated colours and bedecked with various flower garlands. The streets were crowded with curious people rejoicing at the event. The stalls and markets were abundantly filled with merchandise.The city was full of great festivities. The people were curious to see Rama. Sandalwood and incense were burnt and fragrance pervaded in all the directions. The city resembled Amaravati, the abode of Indra.

Sage Vasistha saw handsome Sumantra, minister to Dasaratha, a lion among the charioteers coming out of the gate. Effulgent Vasistha said to the expert chariotieer Sumantra to inform the king immediately of his arrival.

Hasten the maharaja as Rama has to be installed in the kingdom as soon as the day breaks under the conjunction of the sacred Pushya star. Having heard the words of the great Vasistha, charioteer Sumantra entered the inner apartment, singing the praise of this tiger among kings (Dasaratha). The doorkeepers, beloved wellwishers of the king, did not detain aged Sumantra  who was liked by the king and who had arrived early. Sumantra approached the king unaware of the state of his mind and commenced praising him in highly pleasing words (as usual). Thereafter the charioteer Sumantra entered the inner apartment of the king, and with folded hands began singing the praise of the lord of the earth appropriate to the hour. Just as the mighty ocean rejoices at sunrise, the inherently cheerful Sumantra became delighted to see the king. Just as Indra's charioteer at this time (at dawn) extols him, the conquerer of demons, so do I rouse you (with a song). Just as the Vedas and Vedangas awaken the selfborn lord Brahma, so do I  awaken you. As the Sun along with the Moon awakens the auspicious earth which supports all  beings, in the same way I am awakening you today. O mighty king get up at once like the Sun rising up mount Meru. Put on your beautiful body auspicious robes befitting the festivity. O descendent of Kakutstha, may Moon and Sun, Siva and Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra bestow victory on you. O best among kings the holy night has passed. Having been acquainted with the acts accomplished so far, perform whatever is further necessary for the installation    ceremony. All preparations for Rama's coronation ceremony have since been complete. O best among kings the holy night has passed. Having been acquainted with the acts accomplished so far, perform whatever is further necessary for the installation    ceremony. All preparations for Rama's coronation ceremony have since been complete. Venerable Vasistha along with inhabitants of the city and countryside including merchants and brahmins with folded hands awaits you. O king Rama's installation may be promptly ordered. As herds without herdsman, army without commander, night without the Moon, and cows without a bull, so is a kingdom without a king. O king Rama's installation may be promptly ordered. As herds without herdsman, army without commander, night without the Moon, and cows without a bull, so is a kingdom without a king. Hearing these  meaningful words of Sumantra uttered in an appealing tone, the lord of the earth relapsed into grief. The virtuous and glorious king thinking of his son without cheer looked upward with eyes red with tears and said to the charioteer, You are causing my heart excruciating pain with your words. Having heard the sorrowful words of the king and having seen his wretched state  Sumantra with palms folded moved away a little from the place. When the king himself in that wretched state was not able to speak to Sumantra, crafty Kaikeyi said to him in reply: O Sumantra, excited with joy on account of the (proposed) installation of Rama, the king did not have a wink of sleep all night. He is weary and overpowered with sleep. So, O Sumantra quickly fetch the gentle, illustrious prince Rama. Let there be no hesitation in this matter. Thinking that an auspicious event will take place, he rejoiced at heart and in obedience to royal order, left at once. Urged by Kaikeyi, Sumantra thought 'Righteous Rama will definitely come here for the purpose of  installation'. So thought the charioteer and filled with great delight left (the inner apartment), eager to see the mightyarmed Rama. Sumantra, departed from the auspcious inner apartment which looked like the deep waters of the sea and saw people thronging the gate. Then Sumantra hastened towards the gate where he saw kings, wealthy people and citizens who had already arrived and waiting there.       Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The brahmins wellversed in the Vedas stayed waiting all night and assembled at the pavilion (for the consecration ceremony) along with royal priests. For the consecration of the scion of the Raghu race (Rama), ministers, army chiefs and chiefs of merchants' associations assembled, brimming with joy. The best of brahmins had decided to perform the consecration ceremony after the  bright Sun appeared in the sky when the Pushya star approached the karkataka lagna, which was the constellation at the time of Rama's birth. Golden jars filled with water, the welldecorated throne and a chariot  spread well with  bright tigerskin (were kept ready). Water had been fetched from the sacred confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, from other  holy streams, wells, ponds and lakes, from rivers flowing eastward, westward, and  zigzag, from rivers from all directions joined together. And from all the seas. Water had been fetched from the sacred confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, from other  holy streams, wells, ponds and lakes, from rivers flowing eastward, westward, and  zigzag, from rivers from all directions joined together. And from all the seas. Gold and silver vessels filled with holy water and puffed corn, adorned with lotuses, water lilies and leaves from trees rich in sap shone. Honey, curd, ghee, puffed grain, darbha grass, flowers and milk were arranged. Wellmannered courtesans adorned with all kinds of ornaments (stood in position). An excellent fan of yak's tail with a staff of gold  studded with gems looking like diffused moonbeams was kept ready. A lustrous pale white umbrella resembling the Moon's orb or the pole star was kept in front of the coronation pavilion. A bull and a horse both pale white and a majestic elephant in rut worthy of royal ride stood waiting. Eight auspicious maidens adorned with all types of ornaments, all sorts of musical instruments, panegyrists and others (were in waiting). Just as articles necessary for the consecration of the descendants of the Ikshvakus, are customarily arranged in the kingdom, in the same way things were arranged for the coronation of the prince belonging to that race. All those who had assembled there in response to the order of the king could not see him and so they said to themselves 'Who will inform the king of our arrival. Everything is kept ready for consecration of the sagacious Rama as prince regent. The Sun has risen. But we do not find the king'.

Everything is kept ready for consecration of the sagacious Rama as prince regent. The Sun has risen. But we do not find the king'. While the sovereign monarchs who hailed from different parts of the earth were thus talking Sumantra the king's confidant said: In obedience to the king's command I am hurrying for Rama. All of you are honourable to king Dasaratha, especially to Rama. On your behalf I shall enquire from the king who is awake now about his welfare and the reason for calling me here. Having said so, Sumantra who was versed in history and tradition  approached the inner apartment which always remains closed. Entering the king's inner apartment, he began extoling the virtues of the royal dynasty, and stood there as he approached the king's bedchamber. Having approached the king's bedchamber Sumatra stood behind the screen, singing his glory and seeking the blessings (of God) on this son of Raghus dynasty. O scion of the kakutsthas (Dasaratha), may Moon and Sun, Siva and Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra grant you victory The holy night has passed and the auspicious day has arrived. O tiger among kings,  awaken and attend to your duties. O scion of the Raghu dynasty brahmins, army commanders and merchants have arrived and they beseech your audience. Please awake. Dasaratha waking up saw the charioteer and expert counsellor Sumantra extoling him, and said: You had been asked by her (Kaikeyi) to bring Rama here. What is the reason the command is disregarded? I did not sleep (last night). Bring Rama here at once, said king Dasaratha to the charioteer again. At these words of the king, he offered his salutations by bowing his head and left the king's apartment, reflecting on the great happy event. The charioteer left cheerfully, happily looking at the highway bedecked with pennants and banners. The charioteer heard the conversation relating to Rama and his consecration among the happy citizens. Thereafter, Sumantra beheld the beautiful palace of Rama,  resembling  the abode of Indra or the peak of Kailasa in its splendour. The charioteer (Sumantra) beheld Rama's palace closed with two heavypanelled doors. Adorned with hundreds of galleries, it had a peak mounted with golden idols. The arches were studded with different gems and corals. Bright like dense autumnal cloud, it shone like the cave of mount Meru. It was ornamented with excellent garlands and precious diamonds. Pearls were strewn around. Decorated with sandal and aloe wood, it emitted, like the peak of mount Dardura, captivating fragrance Sarasas and peacocks were singing sweetly. The palace was full of skilfully carved images of deer and other embellishments. It attracted the minds and the eyes of all living beings with brilliant splendour. Resplendent like the Sun and the Moon, it looked like the abode of Kubera and a reflected image of the abode of Mahendra. It was crowded with birds of various kinds. In height it was equal to the peak of mount Meru. Villagers thronged the palace with gifts, eagerly waiting with folded hands to see the spectacle of Rama's coronation. Lofty, it looked like a vast cloud. Welldecked and filled with various gems, it was crowded with hunchbacks and kiratas (hunters) too.

In height it was equal to the peak of mount Meru. Villagers thronged the palace with gifts, eagerly waiting with folded hands to see the spectacle of Rama's coronation. Lofty, it looked like a vast cloud. Welldecked and filled with various gems, it was crowded with hunchbacks and kiratas (hunters) too. The charioteer (Sumantra) beheld Rama's palace closed with two heavypanelled doors. Adorned with hundreds of galleries, it had a peak mounted with golden idols. The arches were studded with different gems and corals. Bright like dense autumnal cloud, it shone like the cave of mount Meru. It was ornamented with excellent garlands and precious diamonds. Pearls were strewn around. Decorated with sandal and aloe wood, it emitted, like the peak of mount Dardura, captivating fragrance Sarasas and peacocks were singing sweetly.

Mounted on a chariot, attached with a fender and driven by horses, the charioteer advanced towards the royal palace of Rama delighting the minds of the people of the city. Having reached the palace abounding in deer and peacocks which resembled the magnificent and opulent abode of Indra, the charioteer was thrilled at the allpervading beauty of the place befitting Rama. Having entered the welldecorated palace which was (lofty) like Kailasa, he crossed the courtyards comparable to the abode of the celestials, passed through the many bosom friends of Rama and entered the private apartment. There he heard the happy words spoken by people about the enthronement of prince Rama and his future wellbeing. Sumantra beheld Rama's palace which resembled the high summit of mount Meru shining with splendour. Filled with animals and birds, if looked like the abode of Indra. He saw villagers and others in crores and parardhas, leaving their chariots and thronging the gateway, (some) paying obeisance with folded palms and (some) carrying gifts in their hands. He beheld a beautiful elephant named Satrunjaya with a huge body on which Rama was to mount. It looked like a vast mountain or a huge cloud. With ichor flowing from his temples and without caring for the goad, the elephant was intolerant. Important ministers who were dear to the king and welladorned arrived there on their  horses, chariots and elephants. Sumantra finding his way through the crowd of the people who assembled on all sides, entered the glorious private apartment of Rama. The palace looked like a mountain peak covered by a cloud and a great vimana surrounded by splendid apartments. The charioteer entered the palace unobstructed like a crocodile entering the ocean bristling with many gems.       Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the  holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sumantra, who was conversant with ancient traditions, passed through the entrance of the inner apartment full of people and reached the sparsely crowded courtyard. There alert, loyal young men were attentively guarding the frontyard, armed with spears and bows and wearing shining earrings. Sumantra, who was conversant with ancient traditions, passed through the entrance of the inner apartment full of people and reached the sparsely crowded courtyard. There alert, loyal young men were attentively guarding the frontyard, armed with spears and bows and wearing shining earrings. He saw aged people appointed as security staff for women's apartments. They were welladorned, dressed in orange robes and with rapt attention stood holding staff in their hands. On seeing (Sumantra) arriving, all of them, wellwishers to Rama, quickly rose from their seats. . Humble and extremely courteous charioteer (to the guards) said, Inform Rama at once that Sumantra is waiting at the entrance. Always dedicated to the wellbeing of their master, they approached Rama who was in the company of Sita. And informed him: Coming to know that Sumantra who is intimate to his father had arrived, Rama, in order to please him, commanded that he be escorted to that very place. Sumantra beheld Rama, who resembled Kubera. Rama was sitting on a richlycovered golden couch, welladorned and anointed with precious, pure, fragrant red sandalpaste the colour of which appeared like the blood of a hog. With Sita standing by his side with a fan of yak's tail in her hand Rama, the tormentor of foes, looked like the Moon united with (the star) Chitra. Sumantra beheld Rama, who resembled Kubera.

Sumantra who knew the art of modesty, made humble, reverential salutation to Rama  the granter of boons, shining like the Sun with his own effulgence. On seeing Rama of charming countenance relaxing on a couch, Sumantra, honourable to the king (Dasaratha) said these words with folded palms. O Rama, worthy son of Kausalya, your father along with queen Kaikeyi desires to see you.You may go there. Please do not delay. Highly lustrous Rama ,the lion among men, when thus spoken to, was immensely pleased and extending due honour to him said to Sita: O Sita, I am sure the king and queen are discussing something relating to my consecration. Darkeyed and highly favoured wellwisher of the king (Kaikeyi) is urging him for my sake in view of his intention. My mother, daughter of the king of Kekaya, knows the king's intention and, heppy to do me good, seeks my wellbeing. It is our fortune that the king and his dear queen have sent Sumantra as messenger who is interested in my prosperity and pleasure. There worthy of the council of the king and the queen, a befitting messenger has come. Assuredly the king will consecrate me as heirapparent this very day. I shall go from here immediately and see the king. Remain here happily and rejoice with your maids. Reflecting over the auspicious event, the darkeyed Sita who is highly esteemed by her husband, followed him up to the entrance, (saying): The king will bestow upon you, like the creator of the world (Brahma) bestowing on Indra, the kingdom served by brahmins who are fit to perform 'Rajasuya' sacrifice at the time of consecration. I shall be delighted to see you initiated and engaged in the observance of the vow made pure, wearing excellent deerskin and carrying the horns of an antelope in your hand. May Indra protect you on the east, Yama in the south, Varuna in the west and Kubera in the north. Adorned in auspicious ornaments, Rama took leave of Sita and departed from his palace accompanied by Sumantra. Like a lion living in a mountain cave and coming out of it, Rama while exiting, saw Lakshmana at the entrance bowing with folded hands. Rama, the best among men, met all his friends in the middle courtyard. Having seen them all eager to see him, he approached and greeted them. Thereafter, he mounted the best silver chariot covered with tigerskin and glowing like fire. Rama, the best among men, met all his friends in the middle courtyard.

The sound emanating from the chariot resembled the thunder. The spacious chariot was decorated with gold and gems which dazzled the eyes as though they shed the lustre of the Sun. The swiftmoving chariot was harnessed by excellent horses as if they were young elephants. Like the thousandeyed Indra, Rama, ablaze with royal splendour, mounted this chariot and sped away.

The swiftmoving chariot was harnessed by excellent horses as if they were young elephants. Like the thousandeyed Indra, Rama, ablaze with royal splendour, mounted this chariot and sped away. The magnificent chariot, rumbling like a stormcloud in the sky, emerged from (Rama's) residence like the Moon peeping through a huge cloud. Holding an umbrella and a fan made of yak's tail in his hand Lakshmana boarded the chariot at the rear, guarding his brother. As it (the chariot) was passing out, a tumultuoas roar emanated from the multitude of people all around. Then the chief commanders riding the best of the horses and elephants, resembling hills in size, followed Rama in their hundreds and thousands. Soldiers, anointing their bodies with pastes of sandal and aloe wood, equipped with armour and holding swords and bows, went ahead heralding his (Rama's) arrival. At that time, sounds of musical instruments and songs of eulogy by panegyrists, roarings of warriors were heard on the way. Rama, the subduer of enemies, proceeded while the wellattired women standing at the windows of their mansions showered heaps of flowers on him from every side. Women with faultless limbs standing on their housetops as well as on the ground paid their homage with charming words in order to propitiate Rama. O Joy of your mother (Rama) on seeing you having successfully acomplished the purpose of your journey (life) by securing your father's kingdom, your mother Kausalya will surely be delighted. Those women considered Sita who was dear to the heart of Rama the best among all women. Sita was united with Rama like Rohini with the Moon surely because of her great austerities performed in the past. (They observed). Rama, the best among men, while riding along the highway overheard the pleasing words uttered by women standing on the elevation of their buildings. Thus hearing his own praise Rama proceeded along the highway. Rama, the best among men, while riding along the highway overheard the pleasing words uttered by women standing on the elevation of their buildings. Thus hearing his own praise Rama proceeded along the highway. Rama heard these various words of admiration by people who had assembled there, and (witnessed) the rejoicings of the citizens. This scion of the Raghus (Rama) is going to acquire the earth and the wealth today by the king's grace. He will be our protector and fulfil all our desires. If this Rama obtains the entire kingdom for a long time, it will be in the interest of the people. If he becomes king none will ever witness anything unpleasant or sad. (They observed). With bards, panegyrists and great musical performers invoking blessings and walking ahead, he (Rama) proceeded, like Kubera amid intoxicated elephants  and horses.",
                "Surrounded by friends overwhelmed with great joy, that glorious Rama aboard the chariot beheld the city decorated with banners and pennants and made fragrant with expensive incense and agaru and crowded with multitudes of people. That Rama, proceeded down the middle of the highway made fragrant with agaru and incense, lined with houses gleaming pale white like clouds. The highway (Rama entered) was splendid and spacious with heaps of sandal and agaru of the highest quality, excellent fragrant substances and bundles of white silken cloth. It gleamed with unholed (pristine) pearls, articles made of crystals, flowers of every kind and articles of food of every variety.

It gleamed with unholed (pristine) pearls, articles made of crystals, flowers of every kind and articles of food of every variety. Rama beheld the highway resembling the pathway of gods in heaven. Here the crossroads were always worshipped with curd, grains of rice, sacrificial libations, laja or puffed rice, fragrant substances like sandal wood, agaru and garlands of every kind. Hearing many words of blessings uttered by his friends and honouring each person   according to his rank, he passed on. (They said) Consecrated today, rule the kingdom by adopting the same path followed by your grandfathers and greatgrandfathers. Once Rama assumes kingship, we shall all live in happiness greater than when we were ruled by his father and grandfather. If only we can see Rama enthroned today and going in a procession, there will be no need for food and no greater object of life to be accomplished. For us, there is nothing dearer in the kingdom than the consecration of Rama of undimmed brilliance. Indifferent to such warm words by his friends in his favour Rama passed along the highway. Even though Rama, the best among men had driven past them none was able to withdraw his mind or eyes from him. (They continued). 'Whoever does not see Rama or Rama does not see him, will be blamed by all men in the (three) worlds. Even his self will blame him. That righteous Rama shows compassion to all, to the four castes, to the young and the old. So they were devoted to him. The son of the king proceeded, leaving on his right, squares (intersections of four roads), and roads leading to temples, monuments and shrines too. That prince (Rama) arrived at the excellent palace of the king, which looked like the abode of Indra on earth, blazing with splendour. The various towers of the palace touching the sky resembled clusters of white clouds, like auspicious peaks of Kailasa, and like white aerial chariots decorated with gems.

Crossing the courtyards on his way Rama sent back his followers and entered the private apartment of the king.

                "Rama beheld his father reclined on an auspicious couch and by his side was seated Kaikeyi. He looked wretched with a pale face. With all humility and wellcomposed mind, he made reverential salutation first at his father's feet and thereafter at Kaikeyi's. Dasaratha uttered the word 'Rama', but thereafter could neither say any more in  distress nor look at him becuase his eyes were brimming with tears. Never before did Rama see such frightful appearance of his father. He was seized with fear as if  he trampled a serpent. Maharaja (Dasaratha) with his senses dulled had become emaciated due to sorrow and suffering. With an agitated and troubled mind, he was breathing heavily. Although unshakable, he looked agitated like an ocean with successive rows of waves, like  the  Sun in eclipse, like an ascetic who has uttered falsehood. Maharaja (Dasaratha) with his senses dulled had become emaciated due to sorrow and suffering. With an agitated and troubled mind, he was breathing heavily. Although unshakable, he looked agitated like an ocean with successive rows of waves, like  the  Sun in eclipse, like an ascetic who has uttered falsehood. The more Rama reflected on the incomprehensible sorrow of the king, the more he became perturbed like an ocean on the new Moon day. Devoted to his father's wellbeing, Rama reflected, Why does not father reciprocate my greeting (like on other days)? On other occasions even though angry he would feel pleased. But today  why does he feel sad even after seeing me? With a sorrowful countenance Rama made salutation to Kaikeyi and said like a wretch tormented with grief: Have I committed any offence unknowingly? Please tell me why my father is angry with me. You alone can pacify him. Father has always been affectionate to me but today why is he in a dejected mood?  Why does his countenance look pale and wretched? Why does he not speak to me? Is he suffering from any physical ailment or mental agony? It is affliction of either the body or the mind. (For) perpetual happiness is indeed rare. Has any misfortune befallen the handsome Bharata or the mighty Satrughna or any of my mothers? If I have (ever) displeased the maharaja, my father or disobeyed his command which has angered him, I do not wish to live for a moment How can a man who owes his origin (birth) in this world to him (father) who still exists as a visible god not conduct himself (as per his wish)? Have you said anything harsh to my father out of anger or (injured) selfrespect for which his mind has been shaken? O Devi I am repeatedly asking you the cause of this unprecedented change in the king please tell me the truth. When Kaikeyi was thus asked by the magnanimous scion of the Raghus (Rama) she uttered unashamed these impudent words in her own interest. O Rama, the king is neither angry, nor has any misforturne befallen him. But out of fear for you he is not able to speak out what he has in mind. The goddess of speech does not permit him to say an unpleasant thing to you for you are his beloved son. So you must fulfil the promise he has made to me. In the past the king had honoured me with (two) boons. Now like any other common man he is repenting (for the same). The king bestowed on me boons saying, 'I shall grant you two boons'. But now he wishes in vain to build a dam when the water has run down. O Rama, this (truth) is the basis of righteousness. The virtuous also know this. The king being angry (with me), should not abandon the truth for your sake. If you fulfil whatever the king says, pleasant or unpleasant, I shall relate to you everything. If you do not transgress the word given by the king I shall tell you everything. The king on his own will not tell you. Very much depressed on hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Rama thus said to her in the presence of the king: Alas, what a pity, O queen, it does not behove you to speak to me such words. I can jump into fire. Since he is my father, preceptor and wellwisher, I shall consume deadly poison or even get drowned in the sea if he so commands. Alas, what a pity, O queen, it does not behove you to speak to me such words. I can jump into fire. Since he is my father, preceptor and wellwisher, I shall consume deadly poison or even get drowned in the sea if he so commands. Hence tell me, O Devi Whatever be the desire of the king: I promise I shall carry out, Rama does not say two things (does not go back on his word). To Rama who was devoted to truth and to rectitude of conduct the ignobale Kaikeyi said: O descendant of Raghu in the great war between gods and demons in the past your father had granted me two boons for protecting him when he was wounded by a shaft. O scion of the Raghus, hence I have asked the king for consecration of Bharata and your departure to Dandaka forest today itself. O the best of men if you want to be true to the word given by you and your father, listen to what I say. Abide by your father's command. As promised by him go to the forest for fourteen years. Bharata shall be consecrated, O descendant of the Raghu dynasty with all these preparations made by the king to install you. Forsake this consecration, wear matted locks and deerskin and take refuge in Dandaka forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata live in Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala and rule this kingdom rich in gems of different kinds in horses, chariots and elephants. This is why the king with his face tortured by tears and (his heart) overwhelmed with compassion for you, is unable to look at you. O Joy of the Raghus, O son of the Raghu race, carry out the word of promise given by the king and save him by helping him keep the truth which is great. Even though she was speaking harsh words, Rama did not come to grief. But the magnanimous king was greatly afflicted to see the calamity on his son.       Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the oly Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The destroyer of enemies (Rama) did not feel distressed to hear these words painful like death. To Kaikeyi he said: Be it so I shall go from here to the forest and live there with matted hair and deerskin to keep the promise of the king. Nevertheless I would like to know why king Dasaratha, an unassailable subduer of enemies does not greet me as usual. O Devi you should not grieve. I declare in your presence that I shall go to the forest wearing tattered clothes (bark) and matted locks. Rejoice (to hear this). Ordered by my father who is my wellwisher, my guru, one with a sense of gratidude and, above all a king, shall I not, without hesitation do what pleases him? One thing which hurts me is that the king himself did not tell me about Bharata's consecration. That alone is burning my heart. Unurged, I would have gladly given to Bharata the kingdom, wealth, my most coveted life, and even Sita. In order to keep the promise I shall do everything to fulfil your desire. Needless to say that my father has ordered this. Please console him. Why is it that the king with his eyes fixed upon the ground is shedding tears drop by drop? With the king's orders let messengers go right away on swift horses to fetch Bharata from his maternal uncle's house. As for me, without deliberating on the propriety of my father's orders, I shall go from here at once to Dandaka forest to live (there) for fourteen years. Kaikeyi, happy to hear the words of the son of the Raghus as she was convinced that his departure (to the forest) was certain, hastened him (to set out). Let it be so. Messengers shall go at once on swift horses to bring Bharata from his maternal uncle's house. Since you are eager (to go to the forest), I do not think it is proper to delay. O Rama therefore it behoves you to proceed immediately from here to the forest. Out of shame the king is unable to speak to you. There is nothing other than this. O Rama, the best of men, dispel this distress (of mind). O Rama, as long as you do not hasten to leave this city for the forest, your father will neither bathe nor eat. 'Fie, what a calamity' sighing thus, the king, overwhelmed with sorrow, fainted and fell back on the golden couch. Rama lifted up the king and, urged by Kaikeyi, hastened to depart for the forest like a horse flogged by a whip. Rama listened to the dreadful, cruel words of the ignoble woman but, without feeling any sorrow, said to Kaikeyi, these words: O Devi, I have no desire to live in this world for the sake of wealth. Know me as one with the sages who are devoted only to righteousness. If I am able to do anything which pleases my venerable father, it shall be done in every possible manner, may be even at the cost of my life. There is no greater observance of righteousness than doing service to one's father or carrying out his orders. Though this has not been said by my respectable father himself, I shall live in the forlorn forest for fourteen years in accordance with your word. Since in my case you have exercised more authority (than my father) and pleaded with the king, it follows, you, for sure, do not see any virtue in me, O Kaikeyi (Or else, you should not have asked for Bharata's kingship). After taking leave of my mother and consoling Sita, today itself I shall go to that wild  Dandaka forest. It is your bounden duty to see that Bharata rules the kingdom and serves father. Father (Dasaratha), too tormented with grief to speak cried out loudly on hearing the words of Rama. Effulgent Rama  bowed at the feet of his father who had fallen into a swoon. He bowed at the feet of the ignoble Kaikeyi and set out. Hardly had Rama withdrawn from the harem after circumambulating his father and Kaikeyi when he saw his friends . Lakshmana, the enhancer of Sumitra's delight, with his eyes brimming with tears, followed him in a rage. Rama circumambulated the vessels meant for the consecration ceremony and steadily glancing at them with attention slowly moved away. Rama was the beloved of the people. Loss of kingdom did not diminish his splendour just like night cannot diminish the splendour of the coolrayed Moon. Rama was determined to renounce the kingdom and go to the forest. So none could see any change in his mind. (For) he was one beyond all worldly affairs. Selfpossessed Rama held back his sorrow within his mind, abandoned the auspicious umbrella, welldecorated fans and chariot, sent away kinsmen, citydwellers and others and entered his mother's residence to break the unpleasant news. Selfpossessed Rama held back his sorrow within his mind, abandoned the auspicious umbrella, welldecorated fans and chariot, sent away kinsmen, citydwellers and others and entered his mother's residence to break the unpleasant news. All the glorious people around him did not observe any change in the countenance of that dignified and truthful Rama. The mightyarmed (Rama) did not leave his habitual cheerfulness like the autumnal Moon his own brightness. Firmminded and illustrious Rama treated all people with sweet words and approached his mother. Mighty Lakshmana as virtuous as his brother held the sorrow in his mind and followed him. Rama entered  the palace which was full of great rejoicing. He did not disclose the obstruction that had come on the way of achieving his objective for fear of causing distress to his friends.       Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the tiger among men (Rama) was coming out with folded palms, there arose a huge cry of distress among the ladies of the harem: Rama was the refuge and protector of all the inmates lot of the inner apartment although it was not his duty nor was he forced by his father to safeguard them. That Rama is now going on exile. Rama conducted himself towards us in the same way as he did towards his mother Kausalya right from the begining. Rama who used to avoid deeds that caused anger, pacified those who were angry with him, and never lost his cool even when cursed, that Rama is going on exile today. Alas our king who has lost his brain, who has ordered the banishment of Rama, the refuge of all living beings, (on the other hand) is moving about in the world. Thus all the queens like calfless cows cried loudly blaming their husband. Tormented with grief on account of his son, the king sank in his seat on hearing the cries of distress from the inner apartment Deeply pained yet selfpossessed Rama, heaving sighs like an elephant went towards the inner apartment of his mother along with his brother. Rama beheld a highly venerable elderly man seated at the entrance of the residence and many others standing (nearby). On seeing Rama, all the eminent among the victors got up immediately and greeted him, saying, 'Victory to you'. With the first courtyard crossed, Rama saw in the second aged brahmins versed in the Vedas, and duly honoured by the king. Rama wished the brahmins and saw old men, women and children vigilantly guarding the door in the third courtyard. Wellpleased, the women then greeted him wishing prosperity. They hurried into the abode of Kausalya and gave her the happy news (of Rama's arrival). Having spent the night with a composed mind (abosorbed in meditation), Kausalya was worshipping lord Visnu in the early morning to secure her son's welfare. Always engaged in the observance of vows, Kausalya (then) clad in silk cloth was performing rituals of auspiciousness, offering oblations to the firegod in accordance with mantras (Vedic hymns). Rama entered the auspicious inner apartment of his mother and saw her exhorting the priests to offer sacrificial oblations to Agni (firegod). There Rama saw  curd, grains of rice, clarified butter, sweetmeats, oblations, parched grain, white garlands, porridge of cooked rice mixed with sesame seeds, sacrirficial faggots, vessels filled with water, etc. kept ready for religious rites. There Rama saw  curd, grains of rice, clarified butter, sweetmeats, oblations, parched grain, white garlands, porridge of cooked rice mixed with sesame seeds, sacrirficial faggots, vessels filled with water, etc. kept ready for religious rites. Kausalya, emaciated due to observance of vows and clad in white silk looked like a celestial being. She was engaged in offering libations to the deities. Seeing her son who had come after a long time and who is a source of joy to his mother, Kausalya approached him with great delight like a mare to her young calf. The scion of the Raghus saw his mother coming and bowed her. She held him in both her arms and kissed his forehead. Out of love for her son, the invincible scion of the Raghu dynasty, Kausalya spoke with gentle and pleasant words: May you attain long life and fame like those of the aged, virtuous and great rajarsis  who upheld the righteousness in the race. O scion of the Raghu race see the king, your righteous and truthful father, who will consecrate you as princeregent today itself. Invited (by Kausalya) to partake the food, Rama out of abashment only touched the seat provided to him and having stretched his folded palms spoke to his mother. Modest by nature, Rama with respectful humility began seeking her permission for his departure to Dandaka forest: O mother surely you do not know that a great misfortune has befallen, causing distress to you, Sita and Lakshmana, too. I am setting forth to Dandaka forest.  What is this seat for? A time has come for me when I am fit for a seat of kusa grass. Abstaining from eating meat like hermits and living on honey, fruits and roots, I am to live in the solitary forest for fourteen years. The great king is conferring the status of heirapparent on Bharata while he is banishing me to Dandaka forest to live like an ascetic. Living on things available in the forest, on fruits and roots, I am to dwell in the uninhabited jungle for fourteen years. All on a sidden Kausalya fell down on the ground like the branch of a sal tree in the forest severed by an axe, like a goddess dropped from heaven. Seeing his mother who had done nothing to deserve (this) suffering and who had fallen down like a plantain tree, deprived of her senses, Rama raised her up (from the ground). Rama gently wiped away the dust that had covered her body as Kausalya stood miserable, like a mare who stands up after having rolled on the ground while pulling the load. Kausalya who deserved happiness yet was struck down by (this) distress spoke to Rama, the tiger among men who was sitting nearby, while Lakshmana was listening. O my son, if you were not born to me, I, even as a woman without  progeny, would not have experienced grief, more intense than this. O my son a barren woman has only one mental agony that she has no progeny.  Except that she does not have any other sorrow. I did not have the fortune, O Rama, to enjoy any auspicious moment or pleasure earlier when my husband was in authority. I exist with the hope that I will have it when my son assumes authority. I, being the eldest (of the queens) will have to listen to many heartbreaking and unpleasant words from my fellowwives who are younger to me. There cannnot be greater distress for any woman than such unending grief and lamentation (which I am now experiencing). O child even when you are nearby I am neglected like this. What to say when you are banished. Death is certain to me. Treating me as an equal or inferior to the attendants of Kaikeyi and making me always dependent, my husband has greatly suppressed me. Any one who serves me or follows me will not talk to me after seeing Bharata (installed as heirapparent). Fallen into an unfortunate state how can I look at Kaikeyi's face who is always harsh and in temper? O Rama, I have spent the last seventeen years after your birth with the expectaion that my sorrows would come to an end. Therefore, O Rama, I cannot at this old age endure this great, endless sorrow and the insults from cowives for long. Without beholding your face that is as bright as the full Moon, how can this wretched woman live this pitiable life? Through meditation, through fasts and with a great deal of efforts you have been brought up by this luckless (mother). But alas this is all in vain. I think my heart must be very firm (hard) like the bark of a great river which, touched by (a flood of) fresh water in the rainy season does not disintegrate. There is no room for me in the abode of Yama (the god of death). If he does not carry me off forcibly like a lion carrying away a crying female deer, certainly there is no death for me. Surely my still (hard) heart is made of iron. It neither bursts nor breaks down on the ground. Pervaded by grief, there is no untimely death for this my body, too. My regret is that all my mortifications, gifts of charity and penances are of no avail. Even the asceticism which I practised for the sake of progeny was fruitless like a seed sown in a barren land. If any one, tormented with great sorrow, could willingly commit suicide I would have gone the way to the assembly of Yama (the lord of death) right away as without you I will be now like a cow without a calf. What is the use of this life now? What is life without you whose countenance glows like the full Moon? Like a cow emaciated by its search for the calf, I will follow you into the forest. Kausalya, filled with anger due to extreme sorrow reflected over her misfortune, and burst into harrowing tears, looking at Rama, like a kinnari looking at her grownup son taken captive.       Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Rama's mother, Kausalya was lamenting, miserable Lakshmana said to her these words appropriate to the occasion: O venerable one, I do not like that Rama should go to the forest yielding to the words of a woman and renouncing the welfare of the kingdom. The king  has a perverse nature. He is aged. He is overpowered by passions. He is under the spell of carnal pleasures and is incited (by Kaikeyi). Such a man can speak anything. I do not see any fault in Rama nor any offence committed by him for which he is exiled from the kingdom. I do not find anybody in this world, even an adversary or one defeated, who finds fault with him even in his absence. With no cause nor concern for righteousness, will any one abandon his son who is nearly equal to god, upright, selfrestrained and loved even by his enemies ? Will any son with the ideals of a king in mind accept such words of this king who has entered his chilhood again ? Before this news is known to any one bring the kingdom under your control with my assistance. O Rama who can commit excesses on you, when you stand like  Yama, god of death, protected by me with my bow? O best of men, if the whole of Ayodhya stands against you I shall depopulate it with my sharp arrows. I shall slay all of them who support Bharata and those who seek his prosperity. A gentleman is treated with disgrace indeed. Even if our father instigated by Kaikeyi becomes our enemy, he shall be imprisoned or even slain regardless of our relationship with him. Even a preceptor who follows the unrighteous path and is filled with haughtiness and does not know how to discriminate between good and bad, deserves to be disciplined (punished). O best of men, under what authority or reason this king wants to confer on Kaikeyi the kingdom  that rightfully belongs to you? What authority, O Rama, chastiser of foes, this king has to bestow the kingdom upon Bharata by entering into undesirable hostility towards you and me? O mother, (Lakshmana now tells Kausalya) I am truly loyal to my brother from the bottom of my heart. I swear this by my bow, on my merits earned through charity, by my truthfulness and by the good deeds I have done. O mother rest assured should Rama enter a blazing fire or a forest I must have already entered it. Like the rising Sun dispelling darkness, I shall eliminate your sorrow. O mother Let Rama see my valour. You, too. Having heard the words of the magnanimous Lakshmana, Kausalya, depressed and weeping, said to Rama: O my son you have heard what your brother Lakshmana said and if it pleases you, do later what is to be done. By heeding the unrighteous words of my cowife (Kaikeyi) it does not behove you to leave me griefstricken and go away from here. You are righteous. You know your duty. If you wish to follow the path of righteousness, stay here, serve me and follow the best of dharma. O son Kasyapa who led a life of selfdiscipline and served his mother at home, attained heaven credited with (the merit of) the highest penance. Just as the king is worthy of your respectful homage, so am I. I will not permit you to go from here to the forest. Separated from you, I have no use of this life or happiness. I prefer to live with you even if it means eating grass. If you depart for the forest leaving me griefstricken I cannot live. Here I shall seek death by fasting. O son you will then fall into hell. As wellknown in the world, the ocean, the lord of rivers, incurred the guilt of slaying a brahmin through unrighteous conduct. Thereafter, virtuous Rama addressed these words consistent with righteousness to his miserable mother Kausalya who was thus lamenting: I do not have the power to transgress the orders of my father. Bowing my head I beseech you,  allow me to go to the forest. Learned sage Kandu who knew what is righteousness and a strict observant of vows, slew a cow for carrying out the command of his father. Earlier the sons of Sagara, born in our family, while excavating the earth by the order of their father met a terrible death. Parasurama, son of Jamadagni himself in obedience to the words of his father, decapitated his mother Renuka in the forest with an axe. All of them including many other godlike persons, O Mother fulfilled the words of their father. I shall also make my father's wish come true. I am not O Devi the only one obeying my father's command. All I have mentioned to you did. I am not advancing anything new, contrary to the existing practice. I am only following the trodden path of our ancestors. I will not do as duty anything contrary to what is done by others in this world. No one who obeys the commands of his father falls off the path of righteousness. One who is the best among the knowers of speech and best of all archers, Rama spoke to his mother in this manner and then said to Lakshmana: I know, O Lakshmana, your profound affection for me. I also know your valour,  strength and unassailable energy. O Lakshamana of auspicious qualities, since my mother is not aware of the significance of truth and selfrestraint, she is overcome with grief, great and incomparable. Righteousness alone is supreme in this world and truth is established in righteousness. This excellent command of our father is supported by righteousness. Any one, O hero, who has taken recourse to righteousness should not  allow the promise made to his father,  mother or a brahmin to go in vain. O hero I cannot transgress the command of my father since at his instance only Kaikeyi urged me (to go to the forest). Therefore, leave this ignoble thought, resort to the duty of a kshatriya, take the righteous path. Do not adopt violence. Follow my decision. Speaking affectionately to his brother Lakshmana, Rama with folded hands and head bowed  again addressed Kausalya: I have decided, O mother to go to the forest from here. Grant me the permission to do so. I swear on my life. Perform all the ceremonies for securing prosperity for me. Like rajarshi Yayati of yore who lost heaven and rejained it, I shall return from the forest to the city (of Ayodhya) after the vow is fulfilled. Do not grieve, O mother Be prudent enough to subdue your sorrow in your heart. Having fulfilled father's words, I shall come back from my sojourn in the forest. You, Sita, Lakshmana, Sumitra and I -- all of us shall abide by the words of my father. This indeed is eternal law. O mother in withdrawing the articles (for consecration) and also in subduing the sorrow in your heart approve of my plan to dwell in the forest. Having heard these words so unruffled and tranquil which conformed to  righteousness, mother (Kausalya), like a dead person regaining consciousness spoke to Rama again: By virtue of my own duty and affection towards you, O my son I am as much your preceptor as your father is. I will not grant you permission. You should not go, leaving me deeply distressed. What is the purpose of my life in this world without you? What purpose do I have with  the other world or with the oblations (offered to manes) or with nectar (availble to the gods). I would prefer one moment in your company to the whole world of living beings (without you). At the (inconsolable) lamentations of his mother, Rama was in flames (within) like a mighty elephant prevented from entering the highway by men with fireworks. Rama, centred on righteousness, again addressed his mother who had almost  fainted and Lakshmana who was deeply distressed. As his words were consistent with righteousness, he alone was competent to speak that way. I know your devotion (to me) and your valour, O Lakshmana But now, without understanding my intention you are causing me and mother severe pain and torment. Dharma,artha and kama, O my dear are adjudged in this world according to the fruits of righteous action. All these three are doubtless there (in my decision to go to the forest), like obedience in a wife and love for the mother in good sons. If actions which combine these three (dharma, artha and kama), cannot be performed (which is likely), resort to righteousness. (For) one who seeks wealth is abhorred and one who seeks fulfilment of desires does not attract admiration in this world. Whatever a preceptor, an old man, a king and a father commands whether it is out of anger or pleasure or passion must be carried out as dharma. Who will not do it unless he is heartless? It is impossible for me not to execute the promise completely, O my dear, he (Dasaratha) is our preceptor and, therefore, fit to command us. Even for  mother Kausalya, he is her husband, her refuge and her dharma. While the righteous king is living, more importantly treading the righteous path, how can mother Kausalya, like an ordinary widow, accompany me leaving this city? Grant me permission O mother, to depart for the forest. Bless me and perform ceremonies for my wellbeing so that I shall return (to the city) after completion (of my exile) like Yayati (who came back to heaven) with the strength of truth. I will not forsake this great glory (of fulfilling my father's promise) for the sake of the kingdom. In this transient existence O mother, I do not wish to acquire this insignificant earth unrighteously. Rama, the best among men, thus pacified his mother insisting on his desire to depart for Dandaka forest with courage. And elaborately instructed his brother about his good intentions after which he circumambulated his mother with all his heart.       Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The selfpossessed Rama held his composure and approached his beloved, intimate brother Lakshmana who was (looking) miserable with his mental agony. To him, who was hissing like a king cobra, he said: The selfpossessed Rama held his composure and approached his beloved, intimate brother Lakshmana who was (looking) miserable with his mental agony. To him, who was hissing like a king cobra, he said: Restrain your anger and sorrow. Dismiss this humiliation (from the mind). Achieve great happiness through fortitude. Remove whatever preparations have been made for the purpose of (my) consecration today, and act quickly so that there is no obstacle. Restrain your anger and sorrow. Dismiss this humiliation (from the mind). Achieve great happiness through fortitude. Remove whatever preparations have been made for the purpose of (my) consecration today, and act quickly so that there is no obstacle. O Lakshmana the same enthusiasm with which preparations for my consecration were made be shown for the cessation of those arrangements. Act in such a way that our mother (Kaikeyi), whose heart ached due to my consecration should not entertain any doubt. Even for a moment, O Lakshmana I am not inclined to ignore her sorrow caused by the apprehension in her mind (about the possibility of Rama's coronation). I do not remember to have done anything any time with a motive or without understanding which might have caused even a little displeasure to father or mothers. Let my father who is always truthful, who is really valiant, who is always striving for truth and who is afraid of the next world, be fearless. If the preparations for the consecration are not withdrawn, my father will suffer mental agony for the fear that his word has not come true and his agony will torment me. Therefore, O Lakshmana I want the arrangement for coronation withdrawn before I proceed to the forest from here itself. Immediately after my departure to the forest, the king's (Kekaya's) daughter having accomplished her objective, will enthrone Bharata without any distraction. Kaikeyi will attain peace of mind only after my departure to the forest in tattered clothes, an antelope skin and a crown of matted locks. With wellcomposed mind this decision has been taken. I do not like to inflict pain (on Dasaratha or Kaikeyi). I shall, therefore, depart to the forest without delay. If the award of the kingdom to me is revoked, O Lakshmana, and if I am banished in this manner, see, it is destiny. If this thought and my misfortune were not caused in Kaikeyi by destiny, how could she muster such determination to inflict pain on me? You know, O gentle Lakshmana that never in the past had I any feeling of  distinction amongst my mothers. And Kaikeyi never differentiated between me and her son. I do not find any reason other than destiny for the cruel and brutal words spoken by Kaikeyi with the objective of preventing my coronation and exiling me. If destiny is not the cause behind this, how could Kaikeyi who is gifted with virtues and a noble nature speak such painful words to me before her husband, like an ordinary woman? Inconceivable is the power of destiny. Its impact on all beings cannot be averted. That  an adversity has befallen me and Kaikeyi is (therefore) evident. O Lakshmana which mortal has the power to fight with destiny the grip of which can be comprehended  by following its course only through its effect and nowhere else. Happiness or misery, fear or anger, gain or loss, birth or death, and all such things  are surely the acts of destiny. Even rishis with severe austerities are tormented by destiny and are swerved from  their observances because of anger and passion. Any unanticipated and sudden hindrance to the action undertaken shall be deemed to be the act of destiny. Even though my consecration was thwarted, there is no feeling of sadness in me. In fact I controlled my mind by my intellect. Therefore, be free from grief like me and revoke all the arrangements made for the consecration ceremony immediately. With these very pots (of holy water) brought for the purpose of consecration, O Lakshmana I shall take bath at the time of taking vow for practising penance. Or else, for me what is the use of these pots of holy water which are the king's property? The water drawn with my own hands will be made use of for my religious bath. Do not grieve, O Lakshmana, over the loss of the kingdom. Living in exile is more glorious than running the kingdom. O Lakshmana our younger mother (Kaikeyi) cannot be blamed for her obstruction to my coronation. Overpowered by destiny, she is speaking such unpleasant words. This you know is the impact of destiny.       Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Rama was speaking thus, Lakshmana listened to him with his head down, experiencing both grief and joy. Lakshmana, frowning between his eyebrows, hissed like a great serpent seized with anger in its hole. With his frown, his face looked frightening like the face of a lion provoked. Shaking his forearm like an elephant raising its trunk, moving his neck horizontally and vertically and casting a pointed and oblique look at his brother, Lakshmana said: O Rama, the greatest among the brave kshatriyas you say this because of your fear that (by disobeying father's command) harm will be done to righteousness. This great haste is unwarranted for there is the least apprehension about people's verdict (in favour of exile). How do you, of all persons, speak about destiny as allpowerful in these circumstances when it is powerless? O Rama, the greatest among the brave kshatriyas you say this because of your fear that (by disobeying father's command) harm will be done to righteousness. This great haste is unwarranted for there is the least apprehension about people's verdict (in favour of exile). How do you, of all persons, speak about destiny as allpowerful in these circumstances when it is powerless? Why do you extol this pitiable and powerless destiny? Why don't you doubt those two vicious persons (Dasaratha and Kaikeyi)? Why don't you realise, O virtuous one that there are soft means of creating hindrances in their plan without trangressing dharma. You know dharma. Why don't you understand that their acts of deception wear the guise of dharma? If both of them had not decided before, O Rama the boon granted to Kaikeyi naturally would have been fulfilled long ago. The consecration of any one other than you, O valiant one is universally detested. I do not want to tolerate (this act). You should pardon me in this matter. O noble minded one I hate this righteousness which has deluded your intellect and created this dilemma about this issue. When you are able to counter (this move), why do you want to execute the unjustifiable and contemptible words of the king who is under the spell of Kaikeyi? I am grieved that even though this plot has been hatched by a treacherous mind, you are not taking it in the right perspective. Censurable is adherence to virtue. As both of them are steeped in passion, they never thought of your wellbeing. How will you fulfil the wishes of these enemies miscalled parents? It might be your opinion that their dictate is the decree of destiny. Even then, it does not satisfy me. It (destiny) should be ignored. Those who are timid and cowardly alone depend on destiny.The valiant with of selfrespect will not accept it. In the case of one capable of striking destiny with human efforts it cannot defeat his objective and bring him despondency. Today all will witness the power of destiny and the power of man. The difference between man and destiny will be manifested today. Today people will see destiny defeated by my valour just as they saw your consecration defeated (obstructed) by destiny. I will make destiny, the elephant, running wild on the strength of the rut, unmanageable (even) by the goad, turn back with my valour. All the guardians of the quarters and all the three worlds united cannot prevent the consecration of Rama today, what to speak of our father (king Dasaratha). O king those who, with mutual support banished you to the forest, will themselves  dwell in the forest for fourteen years. Therefore, I shall frustrate the desire of father and of  Kaikeyi who plans the kingdom for her son by obstructing your consecration. Any one who opposes my terrible valour will come to grief. The power of destiny will not cause that much sorrow as my valour will. When after ruling the subjects for a thousand years you withdraw into the forest (for yativrata) your sons will rule them. Leaving their sons to look after the subjects as their own children, the rajarsis in  ancient times used to retire into the forest as per practice. O righteous one, if you apprehend chaos in the kingdom for want of wholehearted support from the (feudatory) kings then, O my valiant brother, I swear to you, I will protect your kingdom like the shore protecting the ocean. Or else, I shall never attain the afterworld of heroes. O righteous one, if you apprehend chaos in the kingdom for want of wholehearted support from the (feudatory) kings then, O my valiant brother, I swear to you, I will protect your kingdom like the shore protecting the ocean. Or else, I shall never attain the afterworld of heroes. The consecration may be performed with these auspicious materials. I am alone capable of facing these kings with my valour. These my arms are not intended to enhance the beauty (of my body). This bow is not for decoration. The sword is not for the sake of strapping my waist. The arrows are not meant to be fixed to my quiver. All these four are meant for taming my enemies. Any one who turns my enemy will not be allowed to remain alive. Holding my sharpedged sword, lustrous as a flash of lightning, I shall  exterminate my enemy even if it were Indra, the bearer of thunder. Any one who turns my enemy will not be allowed to remain alive. Holding my sharpedged sword, lustrous as a flash of lightning, I shall  exterminate my enemy even if it were Indra, the bearer of thunder. This entire earth will become impenetrable and impassable, scattered with the trunks, thighs and heads of elephants, horses and warriors hacked off with my sword. The elephants, struck by the blows of my sword, will fall on earth like mountains engulfed in flames and like clouds with lightning. When I stand before men (enemies) wearing godha and fingerprotector, holding the bow ready, who amongst men will boast of his manliness? Striking each of my foes with many arrows and many with one arrow, I shall aim them at the vitals of men, horses and elephants. O Lord today you shall see the power of my glorious weapons in depriving the king (Dasaratha) of his authority and establishing your supremacy over the kingdom. These arms, O Rama which are fit for sandalwood cream, for wearing armlets, for distributing wealth and for protecting friends, will perform the worthy act of subduing those who are creating obstruction to your consecration. These arms, O Rama which are fit for sandalwood cream, for wearing armlets, for distributing wealth and for protecting friends, will perform the worthy act of subduing those who are creating obstruction to your consecration. Tell me your enemy who should be deprived of his life, fame and friends. Command me as to how this earth shall come under your control. Now itself I shall do that. I am your servant.",
                "Having perceived that Rama was determined to carry out his father's command, Kausalya with her throat choked with tears said these words of piety: How will this righteous Rama, born to me through Dasaratha, who speaks pleasantly to all, and who has not experienced any sorrow before live on the grains gleaned? How will Rama live on roots and fruits in the forest hereafter when his servants and attendants enjoy delicious food (here)? Who will believe that the virtuous and affectionate scion of the Raghus is exiled this way by the king? Who will not tremble in fear to hear this? O Rama if you, being the delight of the world, are (ordered) to go to the forest, it has to be said certainly that destiny which rules everything is allpowerful. After your departure, O son, an incomparably huge fire of grief with sighs of exhaustion will burst from my body, fanned by the wind of your absence and fuelled by lamentation and affliction. My wailing tears will be the oblations. My anxiety will be the great smoke rising vapour. This fire of grief will leave me very much emaciated and burn me like fire burns a forest of dead trees or a bunch of dry grass in summer. After your departure, O son, an incomparably huge fire of grief with sighs of exhaustion will burst from my body, fanned by the wind of your absence and fuelled by lamentation and affliction. My wailing tears will be the oblations. My anxiety will be the great smoke rising vapour. This fire of grief will leave me very much emaciated and burn me like fire burns a forest of dead trees or a bunch of dry grass in summer.

My wailing tears will be the oblations. My anxiety will be the great smoke rising vapour. This fire of grief will leave me very much emaciated and burn me like fire burns a forest of dead trees or a bunch of dry grass in summer. I shall follow you wherever you go, my son, like a cow following its calf. How is it possible for a cow not to follow its wandering calf? At these words of his mother who was deeply afflicted Rama, best among men replied: The king was deceived by Kaikeyi. If you also desert him after I have gone to the forest, surely he will not live. For a woman, to desert her husband is a cruel act. You must not do that which is  contemptible even to think. As long as the king, my father, the lord of the earth, a descendant of Kakutshta lives, you shall serve him. This is eternal virtue (in a woman). At these words of Rama, unshakable in action, auspiciouslooking Kausalya, exceedingly pleased said 'Be it so'. Thus addressed, Rama, the foremost among upholders of righteousness, said to his mother who was in deep grief: You and I should obey father's words. He is the king, supporter, preceptor, the best (among men) and  lord and master of all of us. Roaming the wild forest for fourteen years I shall abide by your words with supreme pleasure. Thus addressed by Rama, the affectionate Kausalya, deeply distressed, her eyes filled with tears, said to her beloved son: O Rama, I am not able to live in the midst of these cowives. O descendant of Kakutstha, if you have resolved to go to the forest as per the wishes of your father take mea wild deeralong with you into the forest. Adding his tears to his mother's who was wailing Rama said As long as a woman lives, her husband is her god and also her lord (master). The powerful king has authority over you as well as over me. As long as he is the sagacious lord of the entire world, how can we be without a master? Bharata, who is virtuous and speaks pleasantly to all beings and who is always attached to righteousness will surely remain obedient to you. After my departure, you must see that the king is not  overpowered by grief for his son and struggles as little as possible. See that the old king does not succumb to this terrible grief. Serve him with a composed mind. A woman may be highly pious engaged in vows and fastings, but if she does not follow her husband, she will be condemned to hell. A woman who serves her husband will attain the highest heaven even if she pays no homage to gods and abstains from worshipping them. A wife who serves her husband and who is engaged in doing good to him is righteous. This dharma exists in this world since ancient times, declared in the Vedas and the smritis. For my sake, O devi worship the firegod with offerings of oblations and flowers, and brahmins who are true to religious vows. Looking forward to my return, spend your time this way with moderate intake, a mind under control and a life devoted to the service of your husband. If my father, who is the best among the upholders of righteousness, survives till I come back, you will have your highest desires fulfilled. To these words of Rama, Kausalya, distressed with grief for her son, replied with her eyes filled with tears: I am unable to dissuade you, O my brave son, from your firm resolve to go to the forest. It is surely difficult (for me) to bide time. Go with a steadfast mind, O my son May god be gracious. Only with your return, I shall be relieved of my suffering. O reverend one, when you come back after having accomplished your purpose, performed your vows and acquitted yourself of the debt you owe your father, I shall attain supreme happiness. O Rama inconceivable is the course of destiny which is inciting you to go to the forest disregarding my words. Go now, O my mightyarmed son and come back safe. And on your return, delight me with your sweet, gentle utterances. O my dear child, how pleasing would it be, if today were to be the day of your return from the forest when I can see you wearing matted hair and robes of bark Seeing Rama full of auspicious qualities resolved to go to the forest and having spoken to him with the fullness of her heart, Devi Kausalya now braced herself up to perform ceremonies in the interest of  Rama's wellbeing.       Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Highminded mother Kausalya, her anguish subdued, performed the sipping rite (achamana) and her self rendered pure, performed auspicious ceremonies for Rama. I am unable to dissuade you, O the best among the descendants of Raghus, from going into the forest. Go now and return soon. Follow in the footsteps of the virtuous. The duty which you are carrying out with courage and selfdiscipline, O tiger among the descendants of Raghu will alone protect you. O my son may the gods in the temples and in other sacred places and the maharshis you bow to protect you in the forest May the weapons endowed with mantric qualities, which were bestowed on you by sagacious Viswamitra always protect you O my mighty armed son protected by the service to your father, mother and to truth, live long O best of men may sacrificial fuel, kusa grass and sacred rings made of kusha grass, sacrificial altars, temples, various levelled sacrificial grounds, mountains, trees, plants, lakes, birds, serpents and lions protect you May all gods known as Sadhyas, Visvedevatas, Maruts, great ascetics, the sustainer (Virat Purusha), the preserver of creation (lord Brahma), Sun, Bhaga, Aryama, and all other important guardians of the world headed by Indra bestow their blessings on you May the six seasons, years, months, fortnights, nights, days and moments bring good to you O my son may Smriti, Dhriti and Dharma always guard you.

May divine personages and gods, Skanda, Soma, Brihaspati, the seven rishis and Narada protect you at all times May Siddhas, guardians of the quarters invoked by me protect you from all  directions in that forest at all times, O my son When you dwell in the forest may all the mountains, seas, lord Varuna, heaven, space, and earth and also all rivers, all stars and planets with their presiding deities, day, night, dawn and dusk protect you When you dwell in the forest may all the mountains, seas, lord Varuna, heaven, space, and earth and also all rivers, all stars and planets with their presiding deities, day, night, dawn and dusk protect you May all the six pious seasons, months, years, kala and kashta contribute to your wellbeing May gods and demons always give you happiness when you wander in that great forest clad in ascetic garb Let there be no fear from rakshasas who are fearful to look at and commit cruel acts, from pisachas (evil spirits) and from flesheating animals, O my child May monkeys, scorpions, wild gnats, mosquitoes, reptiles and insects in that inaccessible forest not trouble you May the mighty elephants, lions with pointed incisors, tigers, bears and fierce, wild, horned buffaloes, do you no harm, O my dear son May the ferocious breed of cernivores I worship not harm you, O my child O Rama may your path be auspecious May your valour be fruitful Go safel and achieve success in everything May gods from the sky, the earth and all other gods protect you and let there be no harm to you from your foes. Propitiated by my worship, O Rama may Brihaspati, Moon, Sun, Kubera and Yama protect you when you are in Dandaka forest May Fire, Wind, Smoke and Mantras emanated from the mouths of rishis protect you when you take your ablutions, O Son of the Raghu race O Joy of the Raghus May Siva, lord of all the worlds, Visnu, supporter of living beings, Brahma, rishis and all the rest of the gods protect you while you dwell in the forest Thus illustrious, largeeyed Kausalya worshipped hosts of gods by offering them garlands and fragrant substances with appropriate prayers. After collecting the sacred fire through great brahmins she duly offered oblations to the gods for the welfare of Rama. Noble Kausalya procured clarified butter, garlands of white flowers, sacred fuel, and grains of white mustard seed (for oblations to the gods). The officiating priest performed the ritual of sacrificial offerings strictly in accordance   with rules for peace and happiness of Rama. With the remainder of the offerings, he performed whatever ceremonies were to be done externally. Thereafter she made the brahmins pronounce benedictory prayers, offering honey, curd, rice and clarified butter.Then she got mantras (expiatory rites) recited for averting evil to Rama while in the forest. The illustrious Kausalya, mother of Rama gave abundant gifts to the best of the brahmins and thereafter said to him: May the same blessings bestowed by all the gods on the thousandeyed Indra at the time of killing Vritra be with you May you be conferred with the same blessings which Vinata bestowed on Garuda at the time of bringing nectar May you be bestowed with the same blessings conferred by Aditi on Indra, the wielder of thunder for the killing of daityas at the time nectar was generated O Rama by occupying three footsteps of space, highly lustrous Visnu owned the three worlds and obtained glory. May you obtain similar auspiciousness O mightyarmed Rama may the auspicious and prosperous seasons, seas, islands. the Vedas, the worlds and the quarters bless you The largeeyed Kausalya placed the remains of the offerings on his (Rama's) head and  applied sandal cream to his body. She tied an auspicious medicinal herb known as Vishalyakarani to his arm for attainment of his objectives, repeatedly muttering prayers. The largeeyed Kausalya placed the remains of the offerings on his (Rama's) head and  applied sandal cream to his body. She tied an auspicious medicinal herb known as Vishalyakarani to his arm for attainment of his objectives, repeatedly muttering prayers. Even though Kausalya was filled with distress, she appeared as if she was very much happy. She uttered  mere words in a confusing tone without applying her mind. Illustrious Kausalya embraced Rama, bending his head down and smelt his forehead. And then said O Rama go in peace and come back after accomplishing the objective. O my son I shall be happy to behold you back in Ayodhya in sound health successful in your objectives and firmly established in the kingdom. When you return from the forest like the full Moon rising, I shall behold you with my anxieties gone and my face sparkling with joy. After you have fulfilled your father's words and returned from your exile I shall behold you seated on the throne, O Rama O Rama, credited with auspicious events on return from the forest, fulfil my desires and those of my daughterinlaw (Sita). O son of the Raghu race Lord Siva and other gods, the great rishis, bhutas, great asuras and serpents and four quarters worshipped by me will always promote your welfare when you dwell in the forest. Thus with her eyes brimming with tears, she duly completed the benedictory rites and  circumambulated the scion of the Raghus and embraced him again and again holding him tight. Circumambulated by mother Kausalya, the illustrious scion of the Raghu race clasped his mother's feet again and again. And shining in his glory, proceeded to the palace of Sita.       Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After the benedictory rites were performed by his mother Kausalya, Rama paid obeisance to her and staying on the righteous path decided to depart to the forest. He entered the highway thronged with people and illumining it with his lustre and stirred their hearts with (remembrances of) his excellent virtues. After the benedictory rites were performed by his mother Kausalya, Rama paid obeisance to her and staying on the righteous path decided to depart to the forest. He entered the highway thronged with people and illumining it with his lustre and stirred their hearts with (remembrances of) his excellent virtues. Sita, her mind preoccupied with thoughts about consecration, was engaged in religious austerities and hence could not hear of all this (development). Experienced in palace rituals, Sita, grateful (to God) after performing worship of the deities was awaiting in a happy mood the arrival of the prince. His head bent down in embarrassment, Rama entered his welldecorated residence thronged with excited people. Sita got up suddenly, (her limbs) trembling to see her husband distressed with grief and agitated with anxiety. On seeing her, virtuous Rama could not contain the sorrow in his mind which  manifested (through his external appearance). On seeing Rama with a pale face. indignant and heavily perspiring, Sita, consumed  with grief said, My Lord, why are you now like this? O scion of the Raghu race, today has been declared by learned brahmins a suitable and auspicious day for consecration under Pushya star with Brihaspati as presiding deity. Then why are you dejected? How is it that your charming face shines not today under a hundredribbed umbrella (white) like foam in water? (How is it that) your face, with its lotuslike eyes is not being fanned by excellent fans of the colour of the Moon or the swan. (How is it that) O best among men eloquent panegyrists, charioteers, bards are not seen singing your praise with auspicious words? How is it that brahmins versed in the Vedas have not duly sprinkled the mixture of honey and curd on your head (prior to your consecration)? How is it that welladorned ministers, citizens from towns and villages, heads of guilds and others do not follow you? How is it that the chief ceremonial chariot, decorated with gold and harnessed by four galloping horses is not preceding you? How is it that the elephant, whose lustre resembles that of a mountain or a dark cloud and endowed with auspicious features is not seen leading your procession, O valiant one O heroic one O handsome one how is it that I do not see your attendants proceeding in front with the throne carved in gold? How is it that when arrangements are under way now for your consecration, the complexion of your countenance does not look like what it was before? There is no joy on your face. O Sita my venerable father is banishing me to the forest, said Rama, the scion of the Raghus, the joy of the Raghu race, seeing her thus lamenting. You were born in a noble family. You know and practise dharma. I shall tell you how this banishment has come about. Do listen. My father, king Dasaratha, true to his promise, had earlier granted two great boons to my mother Kaikeyi. When the king was preparing for my consecration, she reminded him of the promise and in the name of righteousness he has been cornered. I am to dwell in the Dandaka forest for fourteen years while father has appointed  Bharata princeregent. I have come to see you before departing for the desolate Dandaka forest. You should never praise me in the presence of Bharata because intellectuals cannot tolerate others being praised before them. You should never extol my virtues before him. I have come to see you before departing for the desolate Dandaka forest. You should never praise me in the presence of Bharata because intellectuals cannot tolerate others being praised before them. You should never extol my virtues before him. Never expect special treatment from Bharata. You can (continue to) stay with him (here) by conducting yourself in a favourable manner. O Sita the king has conferred the hereditary regency on him. Therefore, O Sita, you must make efforts to win his favour, especially a king's. I am leaving for the forest right away for fulfilling my father's pledge. O highminded Sita be steady. O sinless, auspicious one engage yourself in vratas and fasting after my departure to the forest inhabited by ascetics. You must rise in time and with the (household) gods duly worshipped, pay obeisance to my father, king Dasaratha. You should give importance to duty(dharma) and show respect to my aged mother who is emaciated due to grief. In terms of love, affection and service, the rest of my mothers are all equal. Therefore, you must pay them due respect regularly. What is more important is that you should look on Bharata as your brother and Satrughna as your son. They are dearer to me than my life. Now Bharata is the king of the country and head of the family. Therefore, you should never do anything disagreeable to him. Kings are gratified if they are served with zeal and good conduct. If the contrary happens, they get provoked. Kings abandon (even) their own sons if they are harmful and receive capable people even if they are strangers. O auspicious one live here by being obedient to king Bharata. Absorbed in righteousness, follow truth and (religious) vows. O my beloved Sita I am going to the wild forest. Stay here and never cause displeasure to any one in any way. Could you carry out these words of mine?       Thus ends the twentysixth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the sweettongued daughter of Videha (Sita) who deserved affection, heard this she was very angry out of her love (for Rama). She said these wordsto her husband (in reply): O Rama why are you speaking so lightly? O prince if you hear these very same words (spoken to you), you will ridicule me. O son of a noble monarch father, mother, brother, son or daughterinlaw   (everybody) experiences the merit (of their past deeds) and receives what is due from destiny. A wife alone, O best of men shares the destiny of her husband. I am also therefore, ordered to dwell in the forest. ( a command to you is a command to me). It is not her father or mother, nor her son or herself, nor her friends but her husband alone gives a woman the permanent refuge in this or in the next world. O son of the Raghus if you set out for the impenetrable forest now itself, I shall also go, walking ahead of you and crushing the thorns and (spiky) kusa grass (rendering the path  comfortable for you to walk). Do take me with you, O valiant one without hesitation. Dismiss all anger and envy (from your mind) like the leftover water after drinking (anger because she disobeys and envy because she, too, like Rama, is willing to brave the hazards of forest life). There is no fault on my part. Every woman, everywhere be it on the top of mansions or in lovely palaces or flying in the sky should take shelter at his (her husband's) feet (or follow his footsteps). I have been so instructed by my parents about diverse duties in all stages of life that I need not be told anything (about my duties) now. I will also go to the forest, which is impassable, uninhabited, teeming with various kinds of animals and infested with tigers and wolves. Free from any anxiety about the three worlds, my only concern will be my duties towards my husband. I shall dwell as happily in the forest as I did in my father's abode. I shall wander with you, O heroic Rama in the honeyscented forest remaining selfpossessed, always doing  your service, and observing the vow of celibacy. O respector of individuals when you are capable of protecting other people in the forest, what of me? There is no doudt that I shall go with you to the forest today. O distinguished one I cannot be restrained from this resolve. Do not doubt that I shall not be able to live on fruits and roots or that I will create difficulty for you while living with you. Living with you sans fear, O my sagacious husband, I wish to see the rivers, mountains, lakes and forests here and there. I wish to enjoy the lotus lakes in full bloom, abounding in swans and ducks in the company of a brave husband like you. Observing such vows and bathing daily in the lotus lakes, I shall be very much happy to sport with you, O largeeyed one Thus living in your company for a thousand years or even  a hundred thousand years, I shall not feel the passing of time. I shall not desire even heaven. O Raghava, tiger among men, if I were given heaven to live in without you, even that I shall not covet. I shall go (along with you) to the highly impenetrable forest infested with animals like monkeys and elephants. I shall live in the forest in (full) discipline as in my father's abode, taking shelter at your feet. Since I have no thought other than you and my heart is (irretrievably) attached to you I have resolved to die if separated from you. Pray, be favourably disposed to take me. I shall not be a burden to you. Although Sita was thus appealing, Rama, devoted to righteousness, was (still) unwilling to take her. In order to dissuade her, he began to describe to the mournful Sita the many hardships of forest life.       Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, who knew his duties and was devoted to righteousness, reflected on the difficulties of forest (life) and did not agree to take Sita even though she was pleading the way she did. Righteous Rama consoled Sita whose eyes were blurred with tears, and in order to dissuade her (from going to the forest) said again: Born in a noble race, O Sita, you are always devoted to duty. Follow your duty, here. It will make me happy. Do as I tell you, O delicate Sita. There are, indeed, many hardships in the forest. I shall tell you all about them. Listen to me. Give up the desire to live in the forest, O Sita Living in the dreary jungle, it is said, has many hardships. I am saying all this in your interest. The forest is a haven of hardships. I know of no happiness in the forest. It is frightening to hear the sounds of  waterfalls and the roar of lions living in the mountain caves. Therefore forest life is painful (fearful). Big, wild animals, moving about freely and sporting in the deserted forest, attack on seeing a human. Thus forest is full of danger. The rivers, infested with crocodiles and filled with mud are difficult to cross even for elephants in rut. Hence forest life is always extremely dangerous. . The paths full of thorny creepers, echoing with the noise of wild fowls, and with no water (to drink) are difficult to tread. So forest is a source of suffering. Exhausted with struggles one has to sleep at night on a bed of leaves fallen on their own on the ground. Therefore, forest life is extremely painful. With the senses under control night and day, O Sita, one must be satisfied with the fruits fallen from trees. Therefore, forest life is full of suffering. One has to wear robes of bark and matted hair and take to fasting as long as one can, O daughter of Mithila One has to worship gods and ancestors according to tradition and extend hospitality to guests, (who arrive unexpectedly). One has to wander about all the while (like an ascetic) as per the customs and take ablutions three times a day at prescribed hours. Hence life in the forest is extremely hard. Flowers collected with one's own hands, O innocent one, should be offered on the altar as per injunction of the Vedas. Therefore (life in the) forest is difficult. The wanderers in the jungle, O daughter of Mithila, have to be satisfied daily with whatever little food is available. So forest (life) is a hard life. There is extreme wind and darkness, hunger and fear. Therefore forest (life) is difficult. There are various forms of fierce reptiles fearlessly crawling on the ground. So (living in the) forest is extremely dangerous. The serpents that live in and move like meandering rivers always obstruct  the paths. Therefore, living in the forest is tremendously difficult. Birds, scorpions, insects, gnats and mosquitoes always create trouble. Therefore, life in the forest is all suffering. O lovely Sita there are thorny trees with branches on the top interlaced with one another. There are kusa grass and reeds. So forest life is very hard. There are various physical afflictions and fears for one who lives in the forest. Therefore, forest brings suffering. Anger and greed have to be given up, with the mind preoccupied with ascetic practices. One should not be afraid of fearful situations. Hence forest (life) always very hard. Thus forest life is not suitable for you. On reconsideration, I see that there are many dangers in forest life. When the great Rama decided not to take her along with him to the forest, Sita, deeply grieved said these words.       Thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard the words of Rama, thus spoke Sita in a faint voice in sadness, with tears flowing incessantly from her eyes: Understand that the difficulties of forest life described by you will be turned into advantages if they are accompanied by your affection. O scion of the Raghu race antelopes, lions, elephants, tigers, sarabhas, birds, srimaras and other wild beasts wandering in the forest have not seen your beauty before. Now on seeing you, they will flee away. In fact, who will not be afraid of seeing an object of fear?. O scion of the Raghu race antelopes, lions, elephants, tigers, sarabhas, birds, srimaras and other wild beasts wandering in the forest have not seen your beauty before. Now on seeing you, they will flee away. In fact, who will not be afraid of seeing an object of fear?. In accordance with the command of the elders, I must accompany you to the forest. If I am separated from you, I will give up my life here itself. If I am  in your company, O Rama even the lord of the gods, Indra with all his might will not be able to hurt me. Your salutary instruction to me, O Rama, is 'A woman cannot live without her husband'. This truth is greatly applicable to me. O highly sagacious Rama  I had also heard in my father's house long ago, from brahmins prophesing that some day I shall have certainly to dwell in the forest. O mighty hero ever since I heard the prophesies from the brahmin palmists I am yearning to dwell in the forest. Therefore, O my beloved I must certainly obtain such a command to dwell in the forest. I must accompany you to the forest and it cannot be otherwise. I will go with you, true to the prediction of the brahmin. That time has come and let his prediction come to pass. I am aware, O valiant one, that there are hardships of every  kind in forest life. But they befall those whose senses are not under their  control. When I was young in my father's house, a holy female mendicant foretold in the presence of my mother that I would dwell in the forest (in this life). Pleased with my long entreaties in the past  to dwell with you in the forest, O lord, you had granted my desire. Since then I have been counting time for this forest life. It pleases me to follow my valiant hero as he lives in the forest. Rama, prosperity to you O my purehearted one by following my husband with love I shall become sinless, because my husband is my god. My union with you, O highminded one, is auspicious even beyond death. A woman, given away by her parents in accordance with traditional offerings of water belongs to him even after death and lives with him. This is a statement from the Vedas quoted by famous brahmins. My union with you, O highminded one, is auspicious even beyond death. A woman, given away by her parents in accordance with traditional offerings of water belongs to him even after death and lives with him. This is a statement from the Vedas quoted by famous brahmins. Why don't you want to take to the forest your own wife who is loyal and devoted, and is of good conduct. O Rama, I am faithful and devoted to you. I have equal disposition to happiness and sorrow. I equally share your prosperity and adversity. Therefore, you should  take your wife (to the forest). In this time of distress. If you do not wish to take your wife in this time of distress to the forest I shall die by consuming poison or throwing myself into fire or drowning in water. Despite Sita's  pleadings with him in various ways the mightyarmed Rama would not consent to take her to the desolate forest. Thus spoken to (prevented), Sita was filled with grief and cried, drenching the ground with warm tears that fell from her eyes. That selfpossessed scion of the Kakutstha dynasty consoled the copperredlipped Sita in several ways to dissuade her (from going to the forest).       Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "In response to Rama's consolation with regard to her stay in the forest, the daughter of Janaka, Maithili (Sita) said: Sita agitated over a supreme cause upbraided the broadchested scion of the Raghu race out of love and injured selfrespect. O Rama while accepting you as soninlaw did my father, king of Mithila and lord of Videha ever think that you are a woman in the guise of a man? Alas that will be a falschood if people out of ignorance say that there is no supreme splendour in Rama like the shining Sun. What may be the cause for your fear and depression behind your desire to desert one who is so exclusively devoted to you? Know, O valiant one, that by remaining subordinate to you, I am as faithful to you as Savitri was to her husband, Satyavanta, son of Dyumatsena. O sinless son of the Raghus I am not like other women who bring disgreace to the family. I have not looked at any one except you, even with my mind's eye. I will go (to the forest) along with you. I have been living with you for a long time, O Rama I am young and chaste. Why do you, like an actor, wish to hand me over to others. You, O sinless Rama, may become subservient and obedient to them about whose wellfare you are speaking of and on account of whom you are preventing me to go (along with you). You should not depart for the forest without taking me. Be it for penance or for the forest or for heaven, I wish to be with you. While following you, I will feel no fatigue there on the way as if I am going on a pleasurestroll or in a comfortable couch. The white reeds, the kusha, the sara and the ishika grasses and thorny trees on the way will feel as soft as cotton or as the skin of a black antelope. I shall regard, O charming Rama, the harmful dust raised by the stormy wind and settled on me as the most excellent sandal powder. O rover of the forest I will feel happier when I sleep on the meadows (of tender green grass) on the outskirts of the forest than when I sleep on the couch spread with carpets. Whatever leaves or roots or fruits you collect with your own hands for me little or much, they will be nectar to me. Enjoying the seasonal flowers and fruits in the forest, I will not remember my mother or father or home. Therefore, you should not anticipate any problem from me in the forest. Neither shall I be burdensome to you nor shall I make you experience any sorrow on my account. Wherever I be with you is heaven and without, hell. O Rama, recognise this truth, and derive great pleasure in my company. If you do not take me to the forest without the least hesitation I shall consume poison right now, but not live under the control of enemies (at Ayodhya). If forsaken, O Lord I shall not live a life of sorrow. Instant death is better (than abandoned existence). I cannot bear this grief even for a moment, what to speak of fourteen (ten and three and one) years of grieving. Tormented with grief, Sita piteously and profusely lamented, and then exhausted,  embraced her husband  tightly and cried bitterly. Pierced by so many words (of objection from  Rama), Sita felt like a cowelephant penetrated by poisonsmeared arrrows. And shed her longsuppressed tears like arani (a firekindling stick) kindling fire. Crystallike tears arising out of distress flowed from her eyes like water trickling from two lotuses. Her face with large eyes assumed the brightness of an immaculate Moon and withered with tears like a lotus plucked out of water. With his arms Rama embraced Sita who had almost fainted in grief. And in order to create confidence in her he said these words: When you are in grief O Devi I do not desire even heaven. Like the selfcreated Brahma, I have no fear for any one. O Sita of auspicious countenance even though I am capable of protecting you I did not like your stay in the forest as I did not know your intentions. Since you, O daughter of Mithila, were born to go along with me to the forest, I cannot abandon you just as a selfrespecting man cannot forsake his reputation. O one  with (shapely) thighs like the trunk of an elephant follow only the path of righteousness practised earlier by the virtuous as Suvarchala follows the Sun. Not that I shall not go to the forest (go I must). My father's word nourished by truth is leading me there, O daughter of Janaka Obedience to parents is a righteous act. Therefore, O one with fair hips I cannot live and disobey the word of truth. Mother, father and preceptor are present before us. By overstepping them, how can we, in various ways, worship God who is beyond reach (not visible)? Where these three(mother,father and preceptor) equal to the three worlds are, O one with loverly sideglances, there is none in this world as holy. Therefore, they are to be worshipped. Truth or munificence or homage or distribution of gifts to the revered ones or sacrifices, O Sita, are  not considered as efficacious as service to father. By fulfilling father's wish, nothing is difficult to achieve, whether it is heaven, or wealth, or foodgrains, or learning, or sons or other comforts. Great men who are devoted to the service of their parents attain the world of the gods, of gandharvas, of cows, of Visnu, of Brahma and other worlds. My father who follows the path of truth and dharma whatever be his commands, I wish to obey. He is, indeed, dharma eternal. O Sita, my discretion fails me in deciding whether to take you to Dandaka forest or not. You are, however, firmly determined to follow me, saying, you can live in the forest. O one with fascinating eyes and exquisite beauty you were born to live in the forest. O gentle lady, assist me in carrying out my duties. You, O my lovely beloved Sita, have taken in the right time a highly dignified decision befitting in all ways your family, myself and yourself. O Sita, begin right now all preparations necessary for residing in the forest. O one, with beautiful buttocks, without you even the very heaven does not please me. Give away your jewels to brahmins who need them and food to religious mendicants. Hurry up Do not delay. Distribute among your attendants highly valuable ornaments and excellent clothing, charming articles meant for (court) sport, my couches, chariots and all other things. Offer the rest to brahmins. Distribute among your attendants highly valuable ornaments and excellent clothing, charming articles meant for (court) sport, my couches, chariots and all other things. Offer the rest to brahmins. Having come to know that her departure to the forest is acceptable to her husband, Sita, highly delighted, quickly got ready to give away (things).",
                "Lakshmana who had already reached there heard the conversation (between Sita and Rama). His eyes brimming with tears, he was unable to bear the grief. He held the feet of his brother tightly and said to the illustrious Sita and Rama of great resolve: Lakshmana who had already reached there heard the conversation (between Sita and Rama). His eyes brimming with tears, he was unable to bear the grief. He held the feet of his brother tightly and said to the illustrious Sita and Rama of great resolve: If you have decided to go to the forest where deer and elephants abound, I shall also accompany you by walking before you, holding the bow. Accompanied by me, you will roam the forests echoing with the cries of birds and sounds of herds of animals. Without you, I do not want victory over the gods or sovereignty over the worlds or even immortality. When Rama tried to dissuade Lakshmana with many words of consolation Lakshmana who was determined to go to the forest said again: You have granted permission to me earlier.Why are you now preventing me? I wish to know, O sinless one, the reason why you are dissuading me, when I am willing to go with you. This creates a doubt in my mind. Addressing the heroic Lakshmana in front of him imploring with folded hands to take him to the forest so that he may walk ahead (and guard them), the effulgent Rama said: You are affectionate, you are devoted to dharma. You are valiant. You always walk the path of virtue. You are dear to me like my own life. You are not only an obedient brother but also a friend. O Lakshmana, if you also accompany me to the forest, who will take care of mother Kausalya and the illustrious Sumitra? Dasaratha, the mighty king like Parjanya (the raingod), lord of the earth used to shower favours on earth. But now he is bound by the noose of passion. Once the daughter of king Aswapati (Kaikeyi) gains control over the kingdom, she will do nothing to help her afflicted cowives (Kausalya and Sumitra). When Bharata secures the kingdom, his confidence reposed in Kaikeyi he will not bother about the miserable Kausalya and Sumitra. Either by yourself or by seeking the favour of the king, O son of Sumitra, lend support to venerable  Kausalya. This is the objective you must accomplish. If you do this, your devotion to me will be amply demonstrated. Service to the elders, O dutiful one, is a virtue, great and unequalled. O delight of the Raghu race, do this for my sake, since deprived of us, there will be no happiness for our mother, O son of Sumitra Thus addressed by Rama who was an adept in the use of words, eloquent Lakshmana gently replied: Aware of your power O valiant one, Bharata will undoubtedly pay respect to Kausalya and Sumitra with all humility. Noble Kausalya has under her charge a thousand villages for her sustenance. She can support a thousand men like me. Illustrious Kausalya is competent enough to support herself, my mother and men  like me. Make me your follower. There is no breach of virtue in this. I will have my purpose accomplished. Your object also will be fulfilled. Holding the bow and arrows and carrying a crowbar and a basket, I shall go in front of you leading the way. I shall daily collect roots, fruits and other forest products fit for ascetics. When you go about for pleasure on mountain slopes along with Sita, I shall do everything for you, whether you are awake or asleep. Pleased with his words Rama said, O Lakshmana go and take leave of all your friends. O Lakshmana in the great sacrifice performed by the highsouled Janaka, Varuna himself gave him two aweinspiring celestial bows, two impenetrable divine armours, two quivers with inexhaustible arrows, two swords plated with gold and as bright as the sun. All these weapons are deposited in the house of our preceptor (sage Vasistha) where they are being worshipped. Go and bring them swiftly.

All these weapons are deposited in the house of our preceptor (sage Vasistha) where they are being worshipped. Go and bring them swiftly. Lakshmana, who was resolved to go to the forest, took leave of his friends, and collected from the house of Vasistha, preceptor of the Ikshvaku race, the powerful weapons deposited with him. Lakshmana, tiger among princes, brought all those divine weapons sanctified and  decorated with garlands and showed them to Rama. O handsome Lakshmana, you have come at the expected time, said the selfpossessed Rama affectionately when he saw him arrive. Let us give away, O tormentor of enemies (Lakshmana) my belogings to the ascetic brahmins. Here live the best of brahmins who are deeply devoted to their teachers along with those who are dependent on me for their livelihood. Fetch Suyajna, son of Vasistha, best among the brahmins along with all other distinguished brahmins to whom I will pay my homage and leave for the forest.       Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Lakshmana having understood the very auspicious and welcome order (of Rama)  immediately  proceeded to the house of Suyajna. Lakshmana paid homage to him who was in the firesanctuary, and said O friend, come and see the palace of Rama who is the accomplisher of all difficult tasks. After performing the twilight prayers, Suyajna along with Lakshmana went straight away and entered the beautiful and prosperous palace of Rama. On the arrival of sage Suyajna wellversed in the Vedas, both Rama and Sita offered obeisance to him as to firegod and circumambulated him. Rama, scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, worshipped Suyajna with a collection of golden ornaments such as earrings, anklets, armlets, bracelets and many other ornaments of precious stones. Then urged by Sita, Rama said to him: Rama, scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, worshipped Suyajna with a collection of golden ornaments such as earrings, anklets, armlets, bracelets and many other ornaments of precious stones. Then urged by Sita, Rama said to him: O handsome friend now Sita intends to give away to your wife her necklace, her golden chain and girdle. Could you accept them? Sita is departing for the forest and offers your wife her armlets, wonderful and elegant  bracelets. Sita also wishes to give away a couch with an exquisite cover, encrusted with a variety of precious stones. I am gifting you, O best among brahmins a thousand elephants including Satrunjaya an elephant my maternal uncle had given me. Thus addressed by Rama, Suyajna accepted the gifts and conferred auspicious blessings on Rama, Lakshmana and Sita. Sweettongued Rama calmly said to his brother (Lakshmana) like Brahma addressing Indra: O Lakshmana invite Agastya and Kausika, the two celebrated brahmins, and bestow on them with reverence plenty of precious gems like showers of rain on standing crops. Satisfy them, O highlyarmed Lakshmana, O bestower of honour with a thousand cows, gold, silver and with the great wealth of gems. O Lakshmana, give away chariots, maidservants, silk clothes to learned brahmins of Taittiriya branch and wellversed in the Vedas, to agreeable and faithful brahmins attending on Kausalya with their blessings till they are fully satisfied. O Lakshmana, give away chariots, maidservants, silk clothes to learned brahmins of Taittiriya branch and wellversed in the Vedas, to agreeable and faithful brahmins attending on Kausalya with their blessings till they are fully satisfied. Noble counsellor (of our father) and charioteer Chitraratha has been in our service for many years. Gratify him with invaluable jewels, clothes, wealth, with young female calves and a thousand cows. O Lakshmana many brahmacharis with a staff (as a mark of religious authority) wellversed in Katha and Kalapa portions of the Vedas engaged daily in the study of the Vedas and nothing else. Not active otherwise, they are fond of delicious food and are respected even by great people. Give them eighty carts filled with gems, a thousand bulls capable of carrying paddy, and two hundred oxen capable of  ploughing land and a thousand cows for preparing food (with milk products).

Give them eighty carts filled with gems, a thousand bulls capable of carrying paddy, and two hundred oxen capable of  ploughing land and a thousand cows for preparing food (with milk products). Give each of the large number of brahmacharis wearing girdles and working under Kausalya a thousand (cows or gold coins), O Lakshmana You should, O Lakshmana treat all those brahmins in such a way that my mother shall be pleased on seeing my respectful offerings. Thereupon Lakshmana, a tiger among men, personally distributed like Kubera, gifts of riches to all those Indras among brahmins (best of brahmins) in accordance with the instructions of Rama. Rama then bestowed abundant wealth on each of the dependents as they stood with their throats choked with tears, saying: Till I come back, guard each of the palaces of Lakshmana and mine and ensure that they are not left unattended. Having spoken thus to all dependents who were overcome with grief, Rama ordered the  treasury officer to bring the entire treasure. When all the dependents fetched the entire wealth of Rama, they were pleased to see the great heap of wealth. Rama, best among men, got the entire wealth distributed among indigent brahmins, and young and old alike with the help of Lakshmana. A brahmin by name, Trijata, a descendant of sage Garga and of reddishbrown colour used to live in that region earning his livelihood in the forest by digging the earth with an ironspade and a plough. His young wife, highly distressed due to poverty, keeping her young sons before her said to the aged brahmin: Listen to me throw away this ironspade. Go and see the righteous Rama.You may obtain something. At the words of his wife, Trijata took the path to Rama's palace, having wrapped  himself with a torn upper garment . No one in the crowd stopped Tirjata until he reached the fifth courtyard as he looked like Bhrigu and Angirasa in brilliance. Trijata approached Rama and said O illustrious prince I am a destitute and have many children. I am  living in the forest by collecting leftover grains. Look at me. Trijata approached Rama and said O illustrious prince I am a destitute and have many children. I am  living in the forest by collecting leftover grains. Look at me. Rama jokingly replied to him, I have not yet gifted one thousand cows. Throw your staff and the cows on the space your staff covers will be yours. Bewildered Trijata swiftly tightened up his upper garment around his waist, set the direction for his staff and hurled it with all his might. The staff he hurled crossed the bank of the river Sarayu and fell near a bull in the midst of a thousands cows. The virtuous Rama embraced Trijata, and despatched all the cattle extending up to the bank of Sarayu to his hermitage. Afterwards Rama sought to placate Trijata, that descendant of Ganga, saying: This was a joke. Do not be angry. Your power is unsurpassable and to ascertain this, I incited you to do this act. If there is anything else, ask for it. Truly speaking, there is no limit to seeking wealth. My wealth is specifically meant for brahmins. By distributing all the wealth earned by me, I get pleasure and renown. Thereafter that great sage Trijata along with his wife, immensely happy to receive multitudes of cows, pronounced blessings on the magnanimous Rama for glory, power, pleasure and prosperity. Prompted by the deserving words of acclaim from his friends, Rama distributed with joy and without delay the entire wealth earned by him through dharma. Thus there was none among those brahmins, attendants, poor people, and beggars, who was not satisfied with the honour (received) or with the charity.       Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After giving away plenty of wealth to brahmins in charity, Rama and Lakshmana along with Sita set out to see their father, king Dasaratha. The pair of dazzling weapons held (by Rama and Lakshmana) looked splendid decorated with flower garlands by Sita. The rich climbed their palaces and mansions, terraces of sevenstoried buildings and watched them sadly. The streets were so thronged with multitudes of citizens that they were impassable. Therefore, people felt miserable and ascended their mansions and gazed at Rama. Seeing Rama walking without the royal umbrella, people were very much shocked. They expressed their reaction in so many words: Whenever Rama went out, powerful army of four divisions used to follow him. Today he is walking alone followed by Lakshmana and Sita. Rama who enjoyed the comforts of affluence gratifies those who have desires. Out of veneration for righteousness, he does not want to prove his father false (to his promise). It was not possible even for the creatures wandering in the sky (birds) to have a glimpse of Sita before. Now passersby walking the highway can behold her. Sita who used to apply fragrant unguents and smear the body with redsandal cream will now be exposed to the rain, the heat and the cold which will quickly discolour her body. Surely king Dasaratha possessed of an evil spirit spoke the way he did today. Otherwise, should a king banish his beloved son? Even a son who is bereft of virtues cannot be banished, what to say about Rama, who by good conduct alone has conquered the world. Harmlessness, compassion, learning, good conduct, restraint of senses and selfcontrol, all these six qualities adorn Rama, the greatest among men. Therefore, people are deeply pained to see Rama afflicted. They look like aquatic creatures in summer when the water dries up. Just as severed at the root, an entire tree along with its fruits and flowers is destroyed, similarly the whole world gets afflicted when Rama, the ruler of the world, comes to harm. Effulgent Rama personifies the essence of dharma. He is the root of  (the tree of) humanity. The other people are connected with this tree like flowers, fruit, leaves and branches. Let all of us without delay along with our wives and relations follow Rama, like Lakshmana, wherever he goes. Deserting our gardens, fields and houses and experiencing the same joy and sorrow of the virtuous Rama, we shall follow him. Let Kaikeyi take possession of our deserted and dilapidated homes with ruined courtyards which seem as though struck by calamities. They are drained of wealth and foodgrains, covered with dust and abandoned by the gods. There is no water or smoke (from kitchen). They are infested with rats. They stand unswept. There foodgrains lie around ratholes, and broken earthenwares lie scattered. There are no offerings, no sacrifices, no recitation of sacred hymns, no libations and no invocations.

Since the scion of the Raghu race is going to the forest, let that forest itself be our city and let the city deserted by us become the forest. Let all the fanged creatures leave their lairs, birds and animals the mountain slopes, lions and elephants, their haunts due to the fear caused by our presence and occupy the city left by us (on seeing us deserting). Let Kaikeyi along with her son and her relatives acquire that country which will be inhabited by birds and animals living on grass, fruits, and flesh. Withdrawn, we shall happily live in the forest along with Rama. Let Kaikeyi along with her son and her relatives acquire that country which will be inhabited by birds and animals living on grass, fruits, and flesh. Withdrawn, we shall happily live in the forest along with Rama. Such were the various words uttered by the people. Even after hearing them his (Rama's) mind remained unmoved (from his resolve). Dutiful Rama, endowed with the prowess of an intoxicated elephant, approached the residence of his father that resembled from a distance the peak of mount Kailasa in splendour. Rama entered the royal palace guarded by welltrained warriors and not from very far saw Sumantra who stood a picture of dejection. Even after observing the people in grief, Rama did not reveal his sorrowful feelings. Bound by duty he went in as if with a smile to see his father. Seeing Sumantra stricken with grief for the first time the magnanimous Rama, scion of the Ikshvaku dynasty, on the way to the forest waited there for his father to be informed of his arrival. Rama, lover of righteousness, determined to go to the forest in obedience to his father's command said to Sumantra, Inform the king of my arrival.       Thus ends the thirtythird sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic  composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Let my father be informed of my arrival, said the lotuseyed, darkcomplexioned, venerable, peerless Rama to the charioteer. At the command of Rama, charioteer Sumantra whose senses were overwhelmed with grief quickly entered the apartment of the king and found him heaving sighs. He saw the lord of the world (Dasaratha) dull like the Sun in eclipse, like the fire covered with ashes, like a tank with its water dried up. Seeing the king brooding over Rama, in an extremely agitated state, the sagacious charioteer approached him with folded hands. At first greeting the king with the words 'victory be yours', the charioteer, trembling with fear, gently said in a feeble voice. Your son Rama, the  best of men, having given away his entire wealth in charity to brahmins and to all the dependents is waiting at the entrance. Be blessed audience may be granted to Rama who possesses proven prowess, and now waits, after taking leave of his friends, to see you. O Lord of the world behold him embellished with all princely virtues like the Sun encircled with its rays, (now) leaving for the forest. That truthful and virtuous king (Dasaratha) who was deep like the ocean and free from mud (pure) like the  sky replied: O Sumantra bring all my consorts who are here. In the company of all my wives, I desire to give audience to virtuous Rama. O venerable ones, king Dasaratha summons you. Go there without delay, said Sumantra to the king's consorts after crossing the inner apartment. Thus addressed by Sumantra in accordance with the king's order, all the women went to their husband's palace. Thereafter, Kausalya surrounded by three hundred and fifty  ladies who were faithful to their vows, reached there slowly with their eyes turned copperred (in grief). Usher in my son (Rama), O Sumantra, said the lord of the world (king Dasaratha) to the charioteer on seeing his wives arrive. Then the charioteer fetched Rama, Lakshmana and Sita and advanced towards the king without delay. When the king saw from a distance his son coming with folded hands, he, surrounded by the ladies and tormented with grief, stood up. At the sight of Rama, the lord of men (king Dasaratha), tortured with grief, immediately ran towards him but  before he could reach him, fell unconscious on the floor. Rama and the mighty warrior Lakshmana, quickly reached the king who lay as though  he had lost his senses due to grief. All on a sudden there arose from (the mouths of) a thousand women of the palace cries of 'alas, alas, Rama' mingled with the tinkling sounds of their ornaments. Thereafter Rama and Lakshmana assisted by Sita, lifted him wailing in their arms and laid him on a couch. After the king regained his consciousness in a moment, Rama with folded hands said to him, who was immersed in a sea of sorrow: O great king, I am asking leave of you, for you are lord of  all of us. I am set to depart  for the Dandaka forest. See me (off) in a cheerful mood. Allow Lakshmana and Sita to follow me into the forest. I tried to dissuade them with a number of reasons but they did not agree. Discard your grief and, like Brahma, the creator, allow Lakshmana, Sita and me all of us, your subjects, O respector of men On seeing Rama, unruffled, waiting for his permission to proceed to the forest, the lord of the earth, king Dasaratha said: I have been deluded by Kaikeyi into bestowing boons. Imprison me and be now king of Ayodhya, O scion of the Raghu dynasty Thus spoken to by the king, Rama, skilled in speech and upholder of righteousness, replied to his father with folded palms: You will remain the lord of this earth for a thousand years to come, O king As for me, I will dwell in the forest. Do not deviate from truth on my account. Having fulfilled the vow on the completion of fourteen years of wandering in the forest I shall come back to touch your feet, O lord of men The king who was bound by the cord of truth and instigated by Kaikeyi said, wailing in distress: Go, my dear child, wish you wellMay your path be auspicious, free from obstacles and fear (from any quarters). Come back (after fulfilment of the pledge) O my beloved son O delight of the Raghus you are devoted to truth and duty. It is difficult to dissuade you from your resolve . O son, by all means, do not go now, today, tonight Give me, at least, one day more to see (by with) you to my satisfaction. Stay tonight in the company of your mother and me. With all our desire satisfied, you can set out tomorrow at the appropriate time. O my son, O descendant of the Raghus, you are called upon to accomplish, by all means, a very difficult task. For the sake of my pleasure you are forsaking your dear ones and going to the desolate forest. I swear by truth, O my beloved son, that your departure to the forest is in no way a pleasure to me. With a hidden motive, this woman who is like fire  concealed by ashes has duped me. Instigated by this Kaikeyi, the destroyer of traditions (of the race) I have been deceived for which you wish to pay. It is not a great surprise that you, O my son, being the eldest, want to make your father free from a false promise. Rama and Lakshmana were sad to hear the words of their anguished father. Rama replies: Who will give me the merit (of propriety) I earn today? Therefore, I want to depart (today), discarding all my desires. The kingdom abdicated by me with all its people, its wealth and foodgrains may be bestowed on Bharata. My decision to go to the forest remains unchanged. O bestower of boons, O king  honour to the last word the boons you had granted Kaikeyi. And adhere to truth. As already said, I shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years with forest rangers, in obedience to your commands. Do not brood. Bestow the kingdom on Bharata. I do not have any desire for the kingdom or pleasure. Nothing is dearer to me than compliance with your order, O Delight of the Raghu race Do not brood. Bestow the kingdom on Bharata. I do not have any desire for the kingdom or pleasure. Nothing is dearer to me than compliance with your order, O Delight of the Raghu race Let your grief go. Do not shed tears. The indomitable ocean, Lord of rivers, is never perturbed. I desire no kingdom, no comfort, not this earth nor any pleasure nor heaven nor even life. I wish you, O best of men, to uphold truth and not falsehood. I swear this in your presence in the name of truth and on my merits acquired. It is not possible for me, O father to stay here for a moment any longer. Restrain your grief. There can be no change in my resolve, O king 'O Rama, go to the forest', Kaikeyi had said, and I have given her word I would go. I must fulfil my promise. Do not worry, O Lord We will enjoy (our stay in) the peaceful forest full of deer and resounding with the chirpings of various birds. Father is divine even for the gods as cited in scriptures, therefore, looking upon father as my god, I will carry out his words, O father I shall return after fourteen years have passed, O best among men you will see me back, Give up this grief. When you, O tiger among men, are required (as king) to pacify those whose throats are choked with tears, why this change in you? I am renouncing this city, kingdom and this entire earth, and let all this be conferred on Bharata. In obedience to your order, I shall go and live in the forest for a long time. I am leaving behind, O king this (auspicious) land with its welllaid boundaries, mountain ranges, cities and forests, which Bharata alone should rule. Let it happen the way you have said. O king my mind derives no happiness from great enjoyment or personal comfort as it does from carrying out your order. This is corroborated by the wise. Your grief (relating to filfilment of the vow) on mt account will be dispelled, O sinless one O sinless one by associating you with falsehood I will neither seek this eternal kingdom nor objects of desires nor objects of happiness nor Maithili nor even my life. I only wish that your vow comes true. Entering the forest full of various kinds of trees I shall be happy to view the mountains, rivers and the lakes and to eat fruits and roots. (Hence) do not grieve. The king, immersed in anguish and distressed with tears of grief embraced his son and then fell down unconscious on the floor and lay motionless. Thereupon all the queens except Kaikeyi, wailed loudly. Sumantra, too, cried and fell unconscious. The entire palace cried 'Alas, Alas'.       Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the  holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Overcome with anger, charioteer Sumantra started shaking his head and sighing off and on, crushing his palms and grinding his teeth. His eyes turned red due to anger. Overcome with a sudden, ominous grief, the complexion of his face turned red.  Sumantra understood the mind of Dasaratha. With sharp arrows of words as if piercing the heart of Kaikeyi, he denounced her in exceptionally harsh words which, like thunderbolt, cut her to the quick: Overcome with anger, charioteer Sumantra started shaking his head and sighing off and on, crushing his palms and grinding his teeth.

There is nothing in this world which you are notcapable of doing. King Dasaratha is invincible like Indra, unshakeable like a mountain and unperturbable like the ocean. By causing grief to him through your action I feel you are killing your husband (inch by inch). I think you are ultimately destroying your own race. King Dasaratha is invincible like Indra, unshakeable like a mountain and unperturbable like the ocean. By causing grief to him through your action I feel you are killing your husband (inch by inch). I think you are ultimately destroying your own race. Do not have contempt for Dasaratha who is your husband, nourisher and bestower of boons. For a wife, the desire of her husband is considered worthier than ten million sons. After the death of the king, the princes will obtain the kingdom according to   seniority. Why do you want to break this tradition in the case of Rama, the lord of the Ikshvaku dynasty? Let your son Bharata be king and rule the earth. All of us will go whereever Rama goes. Now by  your act, you intend to transgress the bounds of tradition(code of conduct). No brahmin shall ever dwell in your country. All of us certainly will follow the path pursued by Rama. Abandoned by relatives, brahmins and virtuous men for all times, what pleasure will you derive by your lust for this kingdom? O Kaikeyi, why do you intend to trangress the limits of honour? All of us certainly will follow the path pursued by Rama. Abandoned by relatives, brahmins and virtuous men for all times, what pleasure will you derive by your lust for this kingdom? O Kaikeyi, why do you intend to trangress the limits of honour? It is a wonder that the earth does not split right away when you are perpetrating such an (abominable) act. It is a wonder that while bent upon banishing Rama, you are  not destroyed by frightening fire created by great brahmarsis, crying, 'Shame, shame' By axing a mango tree and growing a nimba in its place and sprinkling it with milk one does not get sweet fruit. Your nature corresponds to your mother's, so I think. 'Honey will not flow from a nimba tree' is a wellknown saying in this world. We have heard in the past about the evil (stubborn) nature of your mother. Once a bestower of boons conferred an extraordinary boon on your father by virtue of which he could tell the sounds of all living beings. He also understood the language of all crookedly  moving creatures. We have heard in the past about the evil (stubborn) nature of your mother. Once a bestower of boons conferred an extraordinary boon on your father by virtue of which he could tell the sounds of all living beings. He also understood the language of all crookedly  moving creatures. Then one day near his bed your highly brilliant father laughed repeatedly over what an ant or a bird said, for he knew the meaning from its sound. 'O queen if I disclose it, then I will undoubtedly die that very movement' replied the king to his wife. Then your mother said to your father, 'Whether you live or die, tell me the cause. You are laughing at me'. Hearing the words of his beloved, king of Kekaya related the entire matter, as it happened, concerning the conferor of boons. That holy man who had granted the boon (to the king) had said, 'Let her die or destroy herself, but do not disclose (the cause of your laughter). Happy to hear these words, your father sent away your mother and moved about like Kubera. O evilminded one you, too, are following the path of wickedness, forcing the king infatuated (with you) to act unrighteously. The generally accepted saying in this world that 'sons resemble the father and, daughters the mother' appears true to me today. Do not be like your mother. Accept what the king says. Abide by his wishes. Be his saviour. Instigated by the wicked, do not attribute unrighteousness to your husband who is equal to Indra in brilliance and is the sustainer of this world. The lotuseyed, sinless and prosperous king Dasaratha, O Devi will not render false the promise given you (he will fulfil it in another form). Let his eldest son Rama, valiant, generous, skilful, dutiful and protector of this world, be consecrated. O Devi, if Rama goes to the forest leaving his father, the king, you will be squarely blamed by the people of the world. Therefore, let Rama potect this kingdom. Be relieved of mental afflictions. There is no other person in this excellent city more competent than Rama to rule this kingdom. If Rama is installed as heirapparent, king Dasaratha, the great archer will retire to the forest for carrying out austerities following ancient customs.",
                "Afflicted on account of the promise he had made, Dasaratha, descendant of the Ikshvakus heaved deep sighs again and again and with his eyes full of tears uttered these words to Sumantra: O Sumantra arrange immediately four divisions of the army, wellequipped with  precious stones to escort Rama in his journey to (the forest). Let the sweettongued courtesans, opulent merchants with well spreadout merchandise make the army of my son graceful. Bestow immense wealth on those who depended on Rama for their living and on the gallant youths with whom he used to sport. Send them along with the entourage. Main weapons, citizens (bodyguards), carts, wanderers in the forest and fowlers wellacquainted with the forest shall follow Rama. Hunting the elephants and antelopes, drinking forest honey, beholding several rivers on the way, Rama will not recollect the kingdom. Let the entire contents of my granary and treasury follow Rama wherever he lives in the desolate forest. Performing sacrifices in the holy places and liberally giving appropriate gifts, Rama will live happily in the forest in the company of sages. (While) mightyarmed Bharata will rule Ayodhya, Rama be furnished with all objects of enjoyment. While Dasaratha was saying these words, Kaikeyi was gripped by fear and her face looked pale. Even her voice got choked. The dejected and frightened Kaikeyi with a dry countenance, looked at the king and said: O virtuous king Bharata will not take charge of the kingdom abandoned by men, drained of wealth and incapable of being enjoyed, like wine with its essence evaporated. King Dasaratha heard the terribly cruel and shameless words of that largeeyed Kaikeyi, and said: O brutal Kaikeyi, you fastened me to the yoke and when I am drawing forward, why do you beat me? O vile woman why did  you not prevent me in the beginning itself? At these wrathful words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi with redoubled fury replied to the king: In your own dynasty  king Sagara prevented his wellknown eldest son Asamanjasa (from enjoying the kingdom). Rama also should depart in the same manner. Hearing the words of Kaikeyi, Dasaratha could say only 'shame'. All the people felt ashamed, but Kaikeyi could not understand this. An aged minister named Siddhartha who justified his name, highly respected by the king said this to Kaikeyi: That wickedminded Asamanjasa used to seize the children playing on the street and amuse himself by hurling them in the waters of river Sarayu. Watching it, all the enraged citizens said to the king, 'O enhancer of the prosperity of the kingdom, either you choose Asamanjasa or us'. The king  then asked them, 'Why this fear?'. And the citizens responded: That insane (Asamanjasa) while throwing our children who were playing around into Sarayu river in his insanity derived incomparable pleasure'. That king (Sagara) heard the words of the citizens and with the intention of doing good to them, banished that malevolent son. Then the father made him and his wife climb a carriage with the clothes they had at the time on them and at once ordered his servants to banish him for life. Like an evildoer wandering about in different directions, holding a spade and a basket in his hand, he went about digging the impenetrable mountains. Highly righteous king Sagara thus banished his son. What sin has Rama committed to secure a similar banishment? We see no fault in Rama. Unlike the stain in the Moon it is difficult to find any  blemish in him. O Kaikeyi speak truly if you find any fault in this scion of the Raghu race (Rama). Then he will be exiled. The act of banishment of an innocent one walking the righteous path is like destroying the brilliance of Indra by restraining his righteousness. O Devi, there is no use obstructing Rama's prosperity. O one with an auspicious countenance, save yourself from the censure of the world. Having heard Siddhartha, the king, stricken with grief, said to Kaikeyi in a gradually feeble voice. O Kaikeyi of vicious behaviour, you do not aceept even the words of Siddhartha. You woman of wicked acts, having adopted vile ways, and abjured the right path cannot know what is good either for you or for me. Abandoning this kingdom, these comforts and this wealth, I shall follow Rama. Enjoy the kingdom for a long time happily along with king Bharata.       Thus ends  the thirtysixth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the minister, Rama who knew how to be polite spoke these words  to Dasaratha humbly: O king giving up pleasures and attachments altogether I am going to live on whatever is available in the forest. What is the use of followers? Having given away the best of elephants, will any one be interested in the rope tied to its girth? Why should one have any attachment for the rope after he has given up the elephant? O best among the virtuous O lord of the world, I do not have any use for this army. I am giving away everything (to Bharata). Bring the bark only. I am going to the forest to live there for fourteen years. Bring me two things: a basket and a crowbar. Thereupon in the assembly of people, without any sense of shame Kaikeyi herself brought the bark robes and said to the son of the Raghus (Rama), Wear it. The tiger among men (Rama) received the bark robes from Kaikeyi and putting off the fine apparel wore the robes of an ascetic. Lakshmana also  removed his auspicious raiment in front (presence) of his father and accepted (put on) the robes of an ascetic. Then Sita in silk clothes glanced at the bark robes meant for her to wear and was frightened like a doe seeing a (fowler's) snare. Sita of auspicious nature who knew her duties and understood righteousness, took the garments made of kusa grass from Kaikeyi. With a sense of abashment her eyes suffused with tears, she said to her husband who was the very image of  the king of gandharvas. Sita of auspicious nature who knew her duties and understood righteousness, took the garments made of kusa grass from Kaikeyi. With a sense of abashment her eyes suffused with tears, she said to her husband who was the very image of  the king of gandharvas. Sita, unacquainted with wearing bark robes, asked Rama, perplexed 'How do the sages who live in the forest wear bark garment?'. The daughter of Janaka, placed one end of the garment round her neck and held the other in her hand, and stood ashamed as she did not know what to do next. Rama, foremost among protectors of righteousness, came forward quickly and fastened the bark himself over her silk garment. Beholding Rama fastening the bark garment on Sita, the women of the inner apartment shed tears from their eyes. Profoundly distressed, they said to Rama glowing with burning lustre O dear, no one has ordered this highminded Sita to dwell in the forest. In obedience to the words of your father, O lord you are going to the forest. Till you return, please allow us to have her (Sita's) audience. Go, O son to the forest with Lakshmana as your companion. (But) this auspicious Sita, will not be able to live in the jungle like a hermit. Do accede to our prayer. Let lovely Sita stay with us as you, O son faithful to your duty, will not like to remain here. While Rama was listening to such words uttered by them, he got the bark robes fastened round Sita who was of similar nature. When Sita wore the bark garments, Vasistha, the king's preceptor who was watching this restrained her (Sita) and said to Kaikeyi: . You are exceeding all limits of decency O Kaikeyi your motive is evil. You are a disgrace to the race You have deceived the king and your behaviour does not conform to the standards (of righteousness). You are devoid of good conduct, O Kaikeyi Divine Sita need not go to the forest. Remaining here she should occupy the royal throne of Rama. For every householder, his wife is the soul. Since Sita is the soul of Rama, she can rule this earth. Otherwise, if Sita goes with Rama to the forest, all of us along with the entire city will follow. The guardians of the harem, its patron king Dasaratha with his retinue and, the people of this city will go wherever Rama lives with his wife. Wandering in the forest and wearing bark, Satrughna and Bharata will live in the company of their elder brother (Rama) in the jungle. Intent upon doing harm to the people with your vile behaviour, you alone rule this kingdom full of trees and deserted by men. That is not a kingdom where Rama does not rule. If Rama lives in the forest, that shall be  the kingdom. If Bharata is truly born to the king, he will not rule the kingdom which has not been bestowed on him (wholeheartedly) by his father. Nor will he live like a son to you. Even if you were to fly from earth to sky, Bharata who knows the traditions of his  father's dynasty, will not act otherwise. Therefore, by greedily guarding your son's interest you are doing him harm. There is  none in this world who will not follow Rama. Today  you shall see, O Kaikeyi, flocks of cattle, elephants, deer and birds following Rama, even the trees bending towards him. O Kaikeyi remove those bark robes and bestow on your daughterinlaw precious ornaments. She was not ordained to wear the bark. Vaisishta, saying so, prevented Sita from wearing that garment. O Kaikeyi, you asked that Rama only should dwell in the forest (wearing bark robes). Therefore let Sita, adorn her body daily, while she  lives in the forest with Rama. Equipped with excellent chariots, attendants, garments, and all other needs let the princess (Sita) go. While seeking boons, you did not include Sita. (Though) Vasistha, endowed with matchless power, the preceptor of the king and foremost among the brahmins thus expressed himself, Sita was not willing to swerve from her resolve in order to serve her beloved husband.       Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Beholding Sita who was wearing a bark garment, like one without a support, though having a husband, all the people cried bitterly exclaiming O Dasaratha, fie on you. Hearing that tumult the distressed Dasaratha lost faith in his own life and in his righteousness. The descendant of the Ikshvakus (Dasaratha), heaving hot sighs, said to his wife O Kaikeyi, Sita does not deserve to go (to the forest) in garment of kusa grass. Sita a delicate, young princess accustomed to comforts is not fit to dwell in the forest. This is what my preceptor has truly spoken. Sita, daughter of Janaka, the greatest among kings, stands amidst people wearing bark garment like an ascetic with her senses switched off. To whom and what harm has she done? Let the daughter of Janaka take off her bark garments. This is not the promise I had made to you earlier. Let the princess happily go to the forest adorned with all jewels and with all other necessities. By giving this cruel promise through importunity, I have rendered myself unfit to live. This promise was made as a child's play and it (now) destroys me like a bamboo destroyed by its own flowers. O sinful woman O wretch Rama might have done something unbecoming to you, but what offence has Sita committed? What wrong has the daughter of Janaka largeeyed like a doe, so gentle and worthy of compassion done to you? Rama's exile, O wicked woman, is enough for you. What are you committing further heinous crimes for? I have heard you, O Devi speaking to Rama when he came here in connection with the coronation. I promised you to that extent only. Having exceeded all that, you want to behold Sita in bark garment and thereby, wish for hell. The king could not see any end to his lamentation. Immersed in the grief of separation from his son and deeply tormented, he fell down on the ground. Rama who was about to leave for the forest addressed his father who sat with his head bent once again: O righteous father O king my aged and illustrious mother, Kausalya possesses neither a mean character nor does she blame you. O bestower of boons,  separated from me and unaccustomed to suffering, she will be plunged into an unforeseen ocean of sorrow. You should pay her greater attention. Let her not grieve on account of her son. O venerable father, if she, who deserves compassion is honoured by you, she will live. You are powerful like Indra.You should act accordingly so that my mother who has a possesive feeling towards her son should not, due to emaciation go to the abode of Yama after my departure for the forest.       Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After hearing  Rama and beholding him in the robes of  an ascetic, Dasaratha and his wives fell unconscious. With his body and mind afflicted with grief, Dasaratha could not look Rama in the face nor could he make a reply. After hearing  Rama and beholding him in the robes of  an ascetic, Dasaratha and his wives fell unconscious. With his body and mind afflicted with grief, Dasaratha could not look Rama in the face nor could he make a reply. The mightyarmed king lost consciousness for a moment and in grief lamented, brooding only over Rama. 'In the past I must have separated many from their children or harmed many living beings. That is why I think this calamity has befallen me. Unless the destined hour arrives, life does not leave the body. Therefore, even though I am tormented by Kaikeyi and even after seeing my son, standing before me, (bright) like fire, taking off his fine clothes and wearing the robes of an ascetic my end does not come. Unless the destined hour arrives, life does not leave the body. Therefore, even though I am tormented by Kaikeyi and even after seeing my son, standing before me, (bright) like fire, taking off his fine clothes and wearing the robes of an ascetic my end does not come. Only because of Kaikeyi  who resorted to this deception in pursuit of selfish ends so many people are made to suffer. Having uttered these words and muttering, 'O Rama' only once, his vision blurred by tears, he could speak no more. Regaining his senses in a moment, the king, with eyes filled with tears, said to Sumantra: Harness the finest horses to the chariot suitable for the journey, drive this magnanimous Rama to a place outside the city, and come back. That the pious and heroic son is banished by his parents to the forest is, I think, the reward to the virtuous for his virtues. In obedience to the words of the king, Sumantra promptly harnessed the horses to a welldecorated chariot and brought it there. With folded palms Sumantra informed the prince that a chariot, decked in gold and harnessed with excellent horses, is ready. The king who was aware of the right place and time summoned hurriedly the treaury officer, who was firm and honest and said to him: Assess the (needs for) number of years the princess of Videha (Sita) is going to be in the forest, and fetch her quickly highly valuable garments and excellent ornaments. Ordered thus by the king, the officer went to the treasury, collected all the things and presented them to Sita. That princess of noble birth from Videha adorned her beautiful limbs with the sparkling ornaments and got ready to depart for the forest. Welladorned Sita illumined the palace like the rising Sun lighting up the sky at dawn. Kausalya, Sita's motherinlaw, took her in her arms, embraced her, kissed her on the forehead, and said to her who conducted herself without evoking any pity. Those women who, although always gratified, do not follow their husband when they fall into misfortune, are regarded as unfaithful. Though they have enjoyed all pleasures (with their husbands) earlier, they censure them in the wake of the slightest trouble or even abandon them. This is the nature of women. Evilminded young ladies are infidels. They are of perverted nature. They are inscrutable. In an instant they lose their love (for their husbands). Neither family traditions nor benefits received, nor education nor affection nor gifts nor even accumulated wealth attract women's hearts. Their minds are unstable indeed. But for those virtuous women whose minds are fixed in chastity, truth, scriptures and stability, the husband occupies a distinguished place and is considered supremely holy. You must not underestimate my son in his exile. You must treat him as your god whether he is wealthy or not. Sita who understood the import of these words which were in conformity with dharma and artha, repiled to her motherinlaw facing her with folded palms: I shall do exactly all that the venerable motherinlaw instructs me. I have heard it earlier and have fully understood as to how I should conduct myself towards my husband. My worshipful motherinlaw should not equate me with wicked people (women). I cannot swerve from the path of virtue like radiance which never leaves the Moon. A veena (lute) sans strings cannot be played. A chariot without wheels cannot move. Similarly, a woman without her husband finds no  happiness even though she has one hundred sons. While the happiness that the father, mother and son give is limited, a husband gives unlimited happiness. Which wife will not worship such a husband? Instructed about my obligations by an eminent lady (her mother?), imbued with these ideals, how can I, O exalted one, underestimate him (my husband)? For a woman the husband is a god indeed Listening to the heartstirring words of Sita, Kausalya with her heart so pure burst instantaneously into tears of joy and grief. Most virtuous Rama approached his mother, that highly revered lady among all his mothers, and with folded hands said: O mother, do not grieve. Look after my father. My stay in the forest will soon come to an end. Fourteen years will pass off like a night's sleep. You will see me come home safe and sound, surrounded by my friends. Speaking thus to his mother with highly polished words, he then turned his gaze at his other three hundred and fifty mothers. To all the mothers who stood deeply distressed with grief the son of Dasaratha spoke with folded hands these words suffused with virtue: If I have been harsh towards you, on account of our living together or through ignorance may you forgive me. I (now) seek leave of you all. All the women with their senses afflicted by grief heard the virtuous and wellbalanced words of the scion of the Raghu race: While Rama said so, there arose a loud cry of the wives of the king like the cry of the female herons. Dasaratha's palace which reverberated, like the rumblings of the cloud, with the sounds of drums and other musical instruments earlier, now immensely griefsticken and trapped in calamity, is filled with wailings and lamentations.       Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, Sita, Rama and Lakshmana with folded palms in a forlom state touched (the feet of) the king and circumambulated him. Taking leave of Dasaratha, the righteous descendant of the Raghus (Rama) along with Sita paid obeisance to his mother Kausalya who was afflicted with deep grief. Immediately following Rama, his brother, Lakshmana also paid obeisance to Kausalya and, thereafter, held the feet of his own mother Sumitra. While the mightyarmed Lakshmana paid her homage, Sumitra wailed, kissed him on his forehead, wished him well and said: Although deeply attached to your beloved ones, O Son, you are born to dwell in the forest. Never be inattentive towards your brother Rama who is on his way (to the forest). Rama is your refuge in times of adversity or prosperity, O sinless one To be obedient to the eldest (brother) is the duty of virtuous men in this world. Charity, initiation at sacrifices and yielding life in battles are the befitting ancient traditions prevailing in your race. Having said this to Lakshmana Sumitra again and again said to her beloved Rama, who was fully prepared, 'Go, go'. (To Lakshmana she said) Regard Rama as Dasaratha, Sita as me and the forest as Ayodhya. My child, go in peace. Then Sumantra who knows the ways of politeness and humility spoke to Rama, with folded hands as Matali did to Indra. O Illustrious prince, wish you well Mount the chariot. I shall convey you speedily whereever you want. You have been directed by Kaikeyi to live in the forest for fourteen years. Accordingly you must now commence counting those years as directed. Sita of lovely limbs decorated herself and with a cheerful mind boarded the chariot which was shining like the Sun. Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana also boarded that chariot decorated with gold and  shining like blazing fire. Fatherinlaw (Dasaratha) gave clothes and ornaments on the assessment of the number of years Sita was going to spend in the forest with her husband. So also Dasaratha secured a multitude of weapons, shields and protective leathercoverings for hands and placed them at the centre of the chariot, for use by the brothers. When Sumantra ensured that Sita, Rama and Lakshmana boarded the chariot,  he briskly hastened the horses which were as speedy as the wind. So also Dasaratha secured a multitude of weapons, shields and protective leathercoverings for hands and placed them at the centre of the chariot, for use by the brothers. When Sumantra ensured that Sita, Rama and Lakshmana boarded the chariot,  he briskly hastened the horses which were as speedy as the wind. Having seen Rama set out  for the great forest for a long period, the city was stilled and men were enervated. The city was distressed and flurried by the intoxicated elephants, provoked by the mighty sound of the tinkling of bells and the neighing of the horses. Thereafter the extremely afflicted people of the city, including young and old alike, ran towards Rama like men oppressed with heat running for water. All the people hanging from the chariot from behind and by the sides, heaving deeply, their faces covered with tears, thus addressed to Sumantra: O charioteer, control the reins of the horses and go slow so that we may look at the face of Rama, for soon we will not be able to see him. Alas, the heart of Kausalya whose son, Rama, resembles the offspring of the gods, does not break even though he is going to the forest Undoubtedly it must be made of iron. Sita, deeply attached to her duty, and with her desire fulfilled is following her husband like a shadow just as the sunlight which never leaves mount Meru. With your desires fulfilled, O Lakshmana, you will attend to your godlike brother who always speaks pleasant words. The very fact that you are  following Rama is a great achievement and a great fortune for you. This, in fact, is the way to heaven. Speaking thus, the people following their beloved Rama, the delight of the Ikshvaku dynasty, were not able to bear (restrain) the tears flowing from their eyes. I wish to see my beloved son said the king with a sense of desolation and emerged, surrounded by forlorn women, from the palace. He heard the women crying loudly in front like wailings of cowelephants when their bull elephant is captured. The king born in the race of Kakutstha, though bright, looked dull then like the full Moon eclipsed (by Rahu). The son of Dasaratha, glorious Rama of inconceivable courage, exhorted the charioteer to drive the chariot fast. Urged by Rama to drive fast on the one hand and by the citizens to stay, on the other, the charioteer could do neither on the way. As the mightyarmed Rama was going away, the dust raised from the earth subsided with the tears falling from the citizens' (eyes). At the time of Rama's departure, the insensate city was drenched with tears of the deeply afflicted people crying, 'Alas, Alas'. Tears born of anguish fell from the eyes of women just as waterdrops fall from lotuses shaken by the movements of fishes. Having seen the city (people) absorbed in one single thought, the prosperous king, griefstricken, fell down on the ground like a tree severed at its root. When the people saw the king enfeebled by deep grief, they raised an uproar behind Rama's (chariot). Some among them wailed 'Oh Rama', while some others cried 'Oh mother of Rama' By crying loudly, they made the women in the inner apartment cry too. When Rama glanced back, he saw his mother and father trailing behind him on the highway, with an agitated and dejected mind. Like a fastened foal cannot see its mother, Rama restrained by bonds of duty could not see his parents clearly. Seeing his parents, who were worthy of riding a chariot now going on foot, who were accustomed to comforts and did not deserve any suffering, Rama urged his charioteer to drive fast. Rama the best among men, could not, like an elephant tormented by the goad, endure that pitiful sight of his father and mother. Rama's mother ran after the chariot, like an affectionate cow running towards the shed to join its fastened calf. While Kausalya was weeping and running after the chariot, crying O 'Rama, O Sita, O Lakshmana, shedding tears for them, Rama repeatedly glanced at her who was twisting and bending as if in a dancing pose. While Kausalya was weeping and running after the chariot, crying O 'Rama, O Sita, O Lakshmana, shedding tears for them, Rama repeatedly glanced at her who was twisting and bending as if in a dancing pose. The king cried, 'Stay, Stay', while Rama said 'Go on, Go on'. Sumantra's mind was caught as if in between two wheels. When the king reproaches you for not stopping the chariot, you can say 'I could not hear'.Prolonging agony is sinful, said Rama to Sumantra. Obeying the command of Rama and after taking leave of the people, Sumantra hastened the horses although they were galloping. The king's men returned, with Rama circumambulated (on the plane of their minds). But from their minds they could not hold back their tears (grief). We should not follow over a long distance those we wish to return, said the ministers to king Dasaratha. Dasaratha and his wives, overcome with grief, heard their words steeped in virtue (wisdom). The king stood there with his perspiring body and melancholic appearance, fixing his gaze on his son.       Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic  composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Rama, the foremost men, was departing with folded palms there arose a huge cry of distress from the inner apartment of ladies. Rama was a refuge and a protector to all the people who were defenceless, weak and miserable. Where is such a protector going now? (said the people). Where is he who, even if reviled, never gets angry, never does acts that provoke anger, pacifies those who are enraged and shares the sorrows of others going now? Where is he, that effulgent, magnanimous one who treated us (with the same respect) as he treated his mother Kausalya, going now? Tormented by Kaikeyi, the king ordered him to go to the forest. Where is he, who happened to be the protector of the people of this world, going now? Alas, the king must be devoid of any sense as he is sending away Rama, who is dear to the world, is righteous and truthful, to dwell in the forest. So wept aloud the anguished wives of the king like cows separated from their calves. Upon hearing the dreadful wailing from the inner apartments of the palace, the king already devasted at the separation from his son, grew even more distressed. The sacred fire in agnihotra sacrifices was not invoked householders did not cook their food the people did not attend to their daily chores. And the Sun set. Elephants dropped their morsel of food. Cows did not suckle their calves. Even the mothers were not pleased with their firstborn sons. The constellation Trishanku, the planets Mars, Jupiter, Mercury and other fierce planets took their position near the Moon. The stars were shorn of their radiance. The brilliance of the planets diminished. Shrouded in smoke the Visakha constellation appeared in the sky. After Rama left for the forest, dark clouds appeared (in the sky) like the (waves of) the great ocean uplifted by the speed of the wind which shook the city. As if covered with darkness, all the cardinal points became agitated. No planet, no star nor was anything (any heavenly body) shining (in the sky). All of a sudden the people of the city became miserable. No one was interested in eating and enjoying (life). All the citizens of Ayodhya, afflicted with a series of grief and heaving deep sighs  ceaselessly bewailed at the sight of the lord of the world (Dasaratha). The faces of the people on the highway were turbid with tears. None looked happy. All were plunged in sorrow. The breeze did not blow cool. No more did the Moon look pleasant. The Sun did not give warmth to the world. All the world was agitated. Mothers stopped thinking of their sons and husbands of their wives. Brothers were no longer interested in each other. Every one deserted every one and thought only of Rama. All the friends of Rama were stupefied. Afflicted with the burden of sorrow they did not leave their bed. Without magnanimous Rama, Ayodhya thereafter looked like the earth along with its mountains bereft of Indra. Afflicted with fear and sorrow it started shaking dreadfully with the sounds of horses, elephants and warriors.       Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As long as the dust raised by the wheels of the chariot of Rama (who was departing to the forest) was visible, Dasaratha, the best of the Ikshvakus, could not withdraw his eyes (from  Rama). So long as king Dasaratha was able to see his exceedingly virtuous and beloved  son (Rama), it appeared that his body kept rising from the earth to have a sight of his son. When the king could no longer see even the dust, he fell on the ground, despondent and grief stricken. Kausalya reached for the right hand of Dasaratha (to raise him up) and Kaikeyi the beloved (mother) of Bharata reached for his left. The king, endowed with rectitude, virtue and also humility, stared at  and said to Kaikeyi with pain. O Kaikeyi you are a woman of evil conduct. Do not touch my body. I do not wish to see you. You are not my wife or my relation. Your dependents have nothing to do with me nor I with them. I denounce you since you are a selfseeker without any sense off righteousness. I renounce the relationship established with you through marriage by taking your hand and circumambulating the fire, both in this world and in the next. If Bharata feels pleased to secure this imperishable kingdom, then may his obsequial offerings at my funeral not reach me Then Kausalya, emaciated due to sorrow, lifted the king who was thoroughly coated with dust and returned to the palace. That virtuous Dasaratha, recalling (the sight of) his son with the robes of an ascetic, burned with remorse as if he had intentionally slain a brahmin or placed his hand in fire. Turning back again and again at the trail of (Rama's) chariot, the grieving king appeared lustreless like the Sun in eclipse. The griefstricken king began to lament thinking of his beloved son, and (suddenly) realizing that his son had crossed the limits of the city, said: I can see the marks of the hooves of the splendid horses carrying my son on the highway but not that magnanimous Rama. Rama, the best of all my sons who, smeared with sandalpaste and fanned by graceful women used to sleep (with his head) on comfortable cushions will surely, from now on, lie down somewhere at the foot of a tree, (his head) pillowed upon a piece of wood or stone. Rama, the best of all my sons who, smeared with sandalpaste and fanned by graceful women used to sleep (with his head) on comfortable cushions will surely, from now on, lie down somewhere at the foot of a tree, (his head) pillowed upon a piece of wood or stone. That unfortunate Rama, having been covered with dust, will get up from the ground sighing like a bull elephant rising from mount Prasravana. Surely the forestrovers will be gazing upon the longarmed Rama, protector of the world, as he rises (from the ground) and wanders in the jungle unprotected. Sita, beloved daughter of Janaka, who is accustomed to comforts, will now wander in the forest troubled by piercing thorns. Sita who knows not the forest will now live in terror, listening to the hairraising, horrible roars of wild animals. O Kaikeyi, your desire is fulfilled.  Rule the kingdom as a widow. Without Rama, the best of men, I don't desire to live. Thus the king, who looked like one after the inauspicious (funeral) bath, surrounded by streams of people entered the most beautiful city (Ayodhya) which portended misfortune. There the mansions and squares on the highways were all deserted. The temples and marketplaces were closed. The people were weak, fatigued and tormented with grief. The highways were not much crowded. Having seen such a sight of the city on all sides, lamenting and brooding over Rama, Dasaratha entered his palace like the Sun plunging into a cloud. There the mansions and squares on the highways were all deserted. The temples and marketplaces were closed. The people were weak, fatigued and tormented with grief. The highways were not much crowded. Having seen such a sight of the city on all sides, lamenting and brooding over Rama, Dasaratha entered his palace like the Sun plunging into a cloud. The palace without Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, stood like a vast, unperturbed lake with serpents snatched away by Suparna (Garuda). Thereupon Dasaratha lamenting with his throat choked addressed (his attendants) in a low, feeble, melancholic, gentle voice: Take me quickly to the apartment of Rama's mother, Kausalya. There is no other place where my heart can find solace. Having heard the king, the doorkeepers took  him to the apartment of Kausalya and  there respectfully made him rest. His mind tossed restlessly although he entered Kausalya's palace and climbed into the couch. To the king, the palace deserted by his two sons and his daughterinlaw, seemed like the sky without the Moon. The valiant maharaja looked around that palace, lifted up his arms and shouted in a loud voice, Oh scion of the Raghus (Rama) you have forsaken me. Oh how fortunate are those best of men who will live until that time to see Rama return and embrace him. In the middle of the night which, for him, felt like the night of death Dasaratha said to Kausalya thus: O Kausalya, my sight that had followed Rama has not yet returned. I cannot see you clearly. Please touch me with your hand. Having seen the king in bed brooding over Rama, the queen, (Kausalya), sitting by his side, sighed and lamented, deeply anguished.       Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Struck by the grief of her son's departure, Kausalya looked at the king who lay on the couch completely exhausted and said to him. Moving crookedly like a snake, Kaikeyi has released her venom on Rama, the best among men. Now she will move about freely like a sheserpent that has cast off its slough. Having banished Rama, she is now happy with her desires fulfilled. And like a vicious serpent living in the house she will again frighten me. It would have been better had I offered her my son as a slave. He would have lived on in the house by doing his duties and begging his food in the city. You have thrown away Rama from his place as per the whim of Kaikeyi, like the share of offering meant for gods given away to rakshasas by the sacrificers on the new Moon days. My mightyarmed son, a great archer and a hero, Rama whose gait is like that of the king of elephants, must be entering the forest along with his consort Sita and Lakshmana. You have banished them as per the desire of Kaikeyi. What will be their plight in the forest, for they have never experienced any hardship earlier Deprived of all costly things they have been banished at the tender age of youth, a time for enjoying their lives. How will they lead a miserable life subsisting on fruits and roots? Will there ever be that auspicious moment to end my sorrow? When I can see  Rama here along with his wife and brother? When will the city of Ayodhya attain that glory when having heard that both the brave brothers have come back the people will rejoice and fill it with uplifted banners? When will, like the swelling sea on a full Moon day, the city hail the return of Rama and Lakshmana, the best among men? When will the mightyarmed hero (Rama) enter the city of Ayodhya with Sita in front in the chariot, like a bull following the cow? When will the people in their thousands shower the parched grain on the highway when my sons (Rama and Lakshmana), subduers of enemies, enter the city? When shall I see both of them wearing auspicious earrings and holding poweful weapons (bows) and swords high, like two mountain peaks? When will I see them delightfully moving round the city with young brahmin girls offering them flowers and fruits. When will Rama, the knower of righteousness, possessing the lustre of gods, and fully mature in age and wisdom come back to me playfully like a threeyearold boy? O valiant one, in my previous birth I must have undoubtedly hacked off the udders of cows when the calves were thirsting for milk from their mothers. O best of men I have been forcibly separated from my affectionate son by Kaikeyi just like a cow from its calf by a lion. I cannot live without my only son who is adept in all scriptures and endowed with all virtues. Without seeing my beloved son, longarmed and mighty, I have but little strength to live in this world. I am consumed by this blazing fire of grief caused by separation from my son like the earth scorched in summer by the Sungod with his oppressive rays       Thus ends the fortythird sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Kausalya, the best of women was thus lamenting, virtuous Sumitra spoke to her these righteous words: My venerable lady, your son Rama is the greatest among men and is endowed with every virtue. Why do you lament in this way? Why do you weep bitterly? In order to vindicate the words of his great and truthful father, O noble lady,your mighty son has renounced the kingdom and has gone (to the forest). He has stuck to the path so scrupulously followed by the wise, the everlasting results of which can be fully realised in the world to come. Such a peerless son is never to be grieved over. In order to vindicate the words of his great and truthful father, O noble lady,your mighty son has renounced the kingdom and has gone (to the forest). He has stuck to the path so scrupulously followed by the wise, the everlasting results of which can be fully realised in the world to come. Such a peerless son is never to be grieved over. Blameless Lakshmana, compassionate to all beings, has acted most nobly in this matter for the benefit of his great soul. The daughter of Videha (Sita) who was used to comforts has knowingly followed your virtuous son into the hardships of forest life. Your allcompetent son who considers righteousness and truth as wealth, is waving  the flag of fame in this world. What is that which your son did not gain ? Knowing Rama's sterling purity and greatness the Sun evidently dare not scorch his body with its rays. A pleasant yet moderately hot and cold breeze blowing through the woodlands will serve Rama at all seasons. While that sinless Rama sleeps at night, the Moon will comfort him by touching him with cool beams like a father embracing his son. To the mighty, heroic Rama, that best of men, Brahmalike Viswamitra has bequeathed many divine weapons, seeing him slay Timidhwaja's son (Subahu), lord of demons, in the battle. He will stay fearless in the forest, relying on the strength of his own arms as though he were living in the palace.

He will stay fearless in the forest, relying on the strength of his own arms as though he were living in the palace. When enemies who are targets of his arrows are destoyed, how can this earth, not stay under the command of Rama? On return from his sojourn in the forest, Rama, endowed with splendour, valour and a strength that brings wellbeing will quickly regain his kingdom. O Devi Rama is the Sun (light) of the Sun, fire (splendour) of the fire, master (command) of masters, prosperity of the prosperous, the fame of the famous, forbearance of the forbearing, god of the gods and supreme among all beings. Whether he dwells in the forest or in the city, he has no demerit whatsoever. O Devi Rama is the Sun (light) of the Sun, fire (splendour) of the fire, master (command) of masters, prosperity of the prosperous, the fame of the famous, forbearance of the forbearing, god of the gods and supreme among all beings. Whether he dwells in the forest or in the city, he has no demerit whatsoever. Rama, the best among men, will soon be coronated with these three namely the earth, the goddess of fortune and Sita. When the people of Ayodhya saw the godlike Rama departing, clad in robes of kusha and bark, they were moved to tears of grief. What is impossible for him who is unconquerable and whom Sita, like the goddess of fortune, follows. When the people of Ayodhya saw the godlike Rama departing, clad in robes of kusha and bark, they were moved to tears of grief. What is impossible for him who is unconquerable and whom Sita, like the goddess of fortune, follows. What is impossible for Rama ahead of whom moves Lakshmana, the best of archers, weilding swords, arrows and other weapons? I tell you the truth, Kausalya, that you will see Rama's return when the period of exile is complete. Hence give up your sorrow and delusion. O irreproachable and auspicious one you will see your son, like the rising Moon, touching your feet with his head. Soon you will see him enthrouned shining in full glory on his return from exile while tears of joy will flow from your eyes. Desist from grief or tear for Rama, O Devi nothing inauspicious will happen to him you will soon see your son along with Sita and Lakshmana. O sinless lady, O queen when you are overcome by fear, how can you console others? O Kausalya,  with a son like Rama, you should not grieve. There is none in this world superior to Rama who stands steady in the path of virtue. Like a flake of cloud in monsoon, you are going to shed tears of joy soon seeing your son along with his friends bowing to you in reverence. Your son, bestower of boons, will soon return to Ayodhya and press your feet with his soft, tender hands. While paying obeisance to you, you will drench your brave son, surrounded by friends, with tears of joy like a mass of clouds drenching the mountain. Irreproachable and skilful in the use of words, queen Sumitra of cheerful disposition fell silent after thus consoling Rama's mother in various ways. On hearing the words of Lakshmana's mother the grief in the heart of the queen (Kausalya), mother of Rama, instantly disappeared like the autumnal cloud that holds but little rain.       Thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the highsouled Rama whose strength was his sense of truth set out for the forest, the faithful people followed him. The king and the hosts of friends were forcibly sent back but they did not return. They continued to follow the chariot of Rama. The illustrious and virtuous Rama was as dear to the inhabitants of Ayodhya as the full Moon. Although entreated by his subjects (not to go) Rama proceeded to the forest  to make his father's vow come true. Looking at the people with love as if they were his own children and as though drinking them with his glances, Rama appealed to them: O citizens of Ayodhya may the love and respect you have shown to please me be bestowed specially on Bharata Bharata, enhancer of the delight of Kaikeyi, possesses an auspicious character. He will do for you everything appropriate, agreeable and beneficial. Though tender in age Bharata is mature in intellect. Gentle, valiant and virtuous, he will dispel all your fears and act as a true protector. Endowed with kingly qualities, he is recognised as heirapparent. Therefore, as I did, all of  you should obey the order of the king. If you desire to please me, act in such a way that the king does not grieve after I have gone to the forest. The more the son of Dasaratha (Rama) committed to righteousness, the more the subjects desired that he should be their king. Rama along with Lakshmana attracted the citydwellers who, choked with tears, were looking miserable. It appeared they were bound with his virtues. Those brahmins who were senior (to him) on three counts like age, wisdom and spirtuality spoke to him from a distance with their heads shaking with age: O horses of noble breed, turn back Do not carry your master swiftyly any farther. Do good to him. All animals, especially horses have a keen sense of hearing. Therefore, having listened to our entreaty, turn back. Your master has a purity of heart. He is righteous, virtuous, brave and firm in resolve, carry him backward and not forward from the city into the forest. Having seen the aged brahmins muttering pitiful lamentations in this manner, Rama immediately alighted from the chariot. Then Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana began walking on foot with slow steps towards the forest. Rama a man of probity and compassion could not ride off in his chariot while those brahmins were trudging far behind. Having seen Rama thus going towards the forest, those brahmins, highly agitated and distressed, said to him: This entire order of brahmins with the sacrificial fires on their hsoulders is following you, their wellwisher. See these umbrellas acquired by us while performing Vajapeya sacrifice are following you like the clouds at the end of the rainy season. You do not have a royal umbrella and you are scorched by the rays of the Sun. We will offer you shade with the umbrellas acquired during Vajapeya sacrifice. O dear child, our minds always pursue the study of vedic hymns. For your sake now they are made to follow the life in the forest. The Vedas are our greatest wealth and they reside in our hearts. Our wives, protected by their fidelity, shall stay at home. We are not going to revoke our decision. We have made up our minds to follow you (into the forest). If you have no regard for this decision, then who will adhere to the path of righteousness? O Rama, you are firm in your duty.We beseech you, our heads bowed with swanwhite hair and soiled with dust, to return to Ayodhya. Many of those brahmins who arrived here have commenced their sacrifices. O dear child, their consummation depends on your return. O Rama, all these living beings, movable and immovable, are devoted to you and are entreating you with devotion to return. Show consideration to those supplicants. Although the trees uplifted by the speed of the wind, intend to follow you, their movement is stalled by their roots. Unable, they appear to be weeping. Even the birds instead of foraging for food are sitting motionless on the trees at one place. They are imploring you, you who are compassionate to all creatures, to return to Ayodhya. While those brahmins were thus crying out, river Tamasa came into view as if seeking  Rama to turn back to Ayodhya. Then Sumantra also unyoked the fatigued horses from the chariot and quickly allowed  them to roll and relax on the ground. Having made the horses drink and dip in water, he released them for grazing not far from Tamasa river.       Thus ends the fortyfifth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The scion of the Raghus (Rama), having taken shelter on the lovely bank of Tamasa, glanced at Sita and said to Lakshmana thus: O Lakshmana, this happens to be the first night of our exile. You should not have any longing in your mind. Wish you well Look at the deserted forest. The wild animals and birds have returned to their hideouts. They fill the air with their cries. There is no doubt that now the men and women of Ayodhya, father's capital city must be bewailing our departure. O best of men because of our many virtues, the people (of Ayodhya) are indeed loyal to the king, to you, to me and to Satrughna and Bharata, too. What distresses me is the thought that both father and illustrious mother may become blind by repeated weeping (over us). Righteous Bharata will indeed console parents with words in conformity with  dharma, artha and kama. As I reflect again and again on the benevolent nature of Bharata, there is no concern in me about my parents, O Lakshmana You, O Lakshmana, the best among men, have done a good job by accompanying me. Otherwise assistance for Sita's protection would have been sought (necessary). O Lakshmana, I shall live this night on water alone. I prefer it, though various kinds of forest products are available. Having said so to Lakshmana, he turned to Sumantra to say O gentle friend, tend the horses with care. As the Sun was setting, Sumantra tethered the horses, fed them with abundant fodder and sat close to them. Then the charioteer worshipping the auspicious Sandhya (twilight), and seeing the night approach made  bed for Rama and Lakshmana. Having seen the bed of leaves made ready on the bank of Tamasa, Rama lay down there along with Sita and Lakshmana. Having seen that his brother along with his wife had fallen asleep, Lakshmana narrated the many virtues of Rama to Sumantra. Lakshmana continued to describe Rama's virtues to the charioteer, keeping awake that entire night on the bank of Tamasa until the Sun rose. Rama spent the night with his subjects not very far from the bank of Tamasa which was crowded with herds of cattle. On getting up, the brilliant Rama looked at his subjects and said to his brother Lakshmana full of noble qualities: O Lakshmana, son of Sumitra look at these people, fast alseep under the trees. Out of affection for us, they are even indifferent to their home. On seeing the people's resolve to take us back, it appears they are prepared to give up their lives rather than abandon their determination. While they are asleep, we shall quickly mount the chariot and fearlessly proceed on the way. These loyal inhabitants of Ayodhya, the city of the Ikshvakus will no more sleep again shelterd under the trees. The prince should deliver the citizens from the sufferings caused by themselves but should not make them suffer on their account. Lakshmana said to Rama who was the very image of like righteousness O wise one, I like this (proposal). Let us quickly mount the chariot. Then glorious Rama addressing Sumantra said O master charioteer, harness the chariot. I shall (let us) quickly leave for the forest. Thereupon the charioteer hurriedly harnessed the splendid horses to the chariot and informed Rama with folded hands: O best among riders the chariot has been harnessed. O mightyarmed one, board it along with Sita and Lakshmana. All the best Rama (along with others) mounted the chariot with his belongings, crossed the rapidly flowing Tamasa agitated with whirlpools. Having crossed the river, the mightyarmed and gracious Rama proceeded on the auspicious and thornless highway arousing confidence even in the timid. With the intention of confusing the citizens, Rama said to the charioteer, O Sumantra, having seated in the chariot proceed speedly for a while in northerly direction and again turn back the chariot. Accomplish this feat in such a manner that the citizens will not know (where we have gone). With the intention of confusing the citizens, Rama said to the charioteer, O Sumantra, having seated in the chariot proceed speedly for a while in northerly direction and again turn back the chariot. Accomplish this feat in such a manner that the citizens will not know (where we have gone). The charioteer did as instructed by Rama, returned to him with the chariot and informed (of its readiness). When Rama and Lakshmana, perpetuaters of the Raghu race along with Sita were seated on the wellyoked chariot, Sumantra urged the horses to move. As it augurs well to travel north Sumantra placed the chariot in that direction. Thereafter that great charioteer, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana boarded the chariot and departed.       Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the night advanced towards dawn the citizens were stunned not to see the scion of the Raghus (Rama). Overwhelmed with sorrow they lost their senses. Anguished and drenched with tears of grief they looked hither and thither but could not find even a trace of Rama. Those highminded people with sorrowful faces due to separation from sagacious Rama expressed themselves in piteous words: Fie on this sleep which robbed us of our senses. We are unable to see (now) that broadchested and mightyarmed Rama. How is it that the mightyarmed Rama who never renders services done to him fruitless has deserted his devoted people and gone into exile? How could he, the best among the kings of Raghu dynasty, who used to protect us as a father protects his own children, go to the forest, abandoning us? We all will die here. We will go on the everlasting journey to death. Of what use is this life to us without Rama? There are plenty of dry logs of wood. We will prepare a pyre with them, set fire to it and we all will enter it. What shall we say (to the people)? How can we say, 'We have conducted him (to the forest), that scion of the Raghus, that mightyarmed Rama, who is of gentle speech and free from malice? Seeing us return without Rama, the women, children and  the aged of the city (Ayodhya) will certainly feel miserable and cheerless. Having left (that city) with the valiant and selfrestrained Rama, how can we now return without him ? All of them with grief distressed, and with their arms thrown up lamented like cows deprived of their calves. For a short while they followed the tracks (of the chariot) and after having gone a little distance, they missed the way. They were again submerged in deep sorrow. When they could not find the tracks of the chariot, those highminded people turned back and said to themselves 'What is this? We have been deceived by fate. What are we to do now?' Thereafter, all of them, the virtuous people grieving, their minds fatigued, returned to Ayodhya the same way they had come. On seeing  the city the minds of the people were agitated due to the loss (of their prince). Tears streamed down their eyes, oppressed with sorrow. This city without Rama just as a river with serpents lifted away by Garuda from its depths looks no longer beautiful. Plunged in grief, they saw the city deprived of all joy, looking like a sky without the Moon and an ocean without water. Those people devoid of delight entered their rich mansions with great difficulty. Even though they, stricken with sorrow, looked at men and their own kinsmen they could not recognise them.       Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The people afflicted with sorrow followed Rama and returned to the city deeply distressed. Eyes overflowing with tears, they longed for death. Smitten with grief, they lost their highmindedness and looked as if their life had been drained out. The people afflicted with sorrow followed Rama and returned to the city deeply distressed. Eyes overflowing with tears, they longed for death. Smitten with grief, they lost their highmindedness and looked as if their life had been drained out. The subjects reached their respective homes  and surrounded by their sons and wives  broke down their faces flooded with tears. The people had no joy in life nor did they find cheer in anything. The merchants did not offer their wares for sale. The marketplace looked graceless (lifeless). (The stocks were empty). The householders did not cook their food. Neither loss nor acquisition of wealth mattered (to the people). No mother rejoiced over getting her firstborn son. In every house, women wept and in anguish heaped abuses on their husbands on their arrival at home with words (sharp) like goads on elephants: For those who do not see Rama, of what use are the houses or spouses or sons or fortunes or delight? Lakshmana is the only fortunate person in the world who has followed Rama of the Kakutstha race along with Sita to serve them. The rivers and the lotuspools have done some meritorious acts in the past as a result of which Rama having plunged into their holy waters will make his ablution. Forests with beautiful groves rivers with vast expanse of waters, mountains with their slopes will enhance the lustre of the scion of the Kakutsthas (Rama). Whichever hill or forest Rama visits, people will receive him there like a welcome  guest and will not fail to render hospitality to him. Trees with bunches of cololurful flowers and clusters of blossoms hovering over with black bees will present themselves to the son of the Raghus (Rama). The hills will exhibit their excellent flowers and fruits off season out of compassion in order to welcome Rama. The mountains, displaying various wonderful streams here and there, will flow with pellucid waters (for Rama). The trees on the mountain summits will enchant Rama. Where Rama goes, there will be no room for fear or dishonour. Before that valiant, strongarmed son of Dasaratha goes too far away (from us), we should follow him. The shadow of the feet of this magnanimous lord will give us happiness. He alone is the goal and protector of all these people. He is the supreme refuge. We will serve Sita. You will serve Rama. Such were the words of the distressed women of the city to their husbands. (They continued). In the forest, Rama will look after your wellbeing and Sita will ensure our, women folk's security. The people here are choked with grief. Who will like to stay here where life is disagreeable, cheerless, full of despondency and distress? If Kaikeyi rules this kingdom unethically, we do not want to live here like orphans. What is the use of our progeny or property (in such a place)? Can Kaikeyi, who has brought disgrace to the race by abandoning her husband and son for the sake of wealth, spare others? We swear on our sons that as long as Kaikeyi lives, or we live, we will never stay in her kingdom as servants. Who can live with pleasure under the rule of Kaikeyi of  unrighteous character and wicked behaviour, one who without compassion banished Rama, son of Dasaratha, king of kings? The entire kingdom, for the sake of Kaikeyi, is under a great calamity. With no support or leader it will definitely go to ruin. Now that Rama has been banished, the king will not live (long). After his death there will be evidently only lamentations. Where you are in deep trouble with merits exhausted, it is better to take poison, or follow Rama or walk into the unknown. Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana has been deceitfully exiled and all of us delivered to Bharata like beasts to a butcher (for protection). Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana is a tiger among men, a subduer of enemies, powerful like an intoxicated elephant, and a great charioteer. Blue in complexion, he has a face like the full Moon. He has lotuslike eyes, kneelong arms and fleshy clavicles. Endowed with a sweet nature, he always speaks the truth and the first to speak to others. When he roams the forest, charming like the Moon and pleasing to the whole world, he will surely make it look graceful.

Overcome with grief as if frightened at the approach of death, they wept bitterly. As the women of the city were thus lamenting over the scion of the Raghus (Rama) (sitting) at home, the sun set. Night fell. With sacrificial fires extinguished and the reading of holy scriptures and sacred recitations stopped, Ayodhya looked as if besmeared with darkness. With markets closed, the city of Ayodhya cheerless and shelterless looked like the sky without stars. The women grieved over Rama as if a son or a brother had been exiled. Depressed and distressed, they wept and sobbed. For them, Rama was indeed more than their sons. With the cessation of singing, celebrations, dance and music, there was no rejoicing in the city. The markets displaying merchandise were shut down. The city of Ayodhya looked like the ocean with its waters diminished.       Thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Recollecting his father's command, Rama, the foremost among men, covered a long distance during the remaining part of the night. While Rama was thus travelling, the auspicious night ended. With the sandhya (morning twilight), worship over, he reached the frontiers of the country. Watching the villages furrowed at the outskirts, forests in blossom, hearing the gossips of the people living in the midst of villages, Rama felt he was moving very slowly whereas he had actually covered a long distance with those excellent (swift) horses. (The villagers were speaking among themselves) Fie on the king who is overtaken by passion Alas, the heartless, sinful Kaikeyi, indulging in evil has banished into the forest this prince who is righteous and sagacious, compassionate and selfrestrained. How could this cruel Kaikeyi, by breaking all limits of decorum resort to such atrocious action?

Alas, the loveless king Dasaratha now intends to abandon his own sinless son Rama who is dear to the subjects. Such were the words of people living in villages and hamlets that Rama the valiant lord of Kosala happened to hear as he was crossing the boundaries of Kosala. He then crossed the river Vedasruti flowing with sacred waters and went in the southern direction where sage Agastya resided. Travelling for a long time along the river Gomati full of cool waters on whose marshy bank cows grazed, Rama crossed it at the point where it flows into the sea. Gomati gone, Rama with the swiftmoving horses crossed the river Syandika echoing with the cries of peacocks and swans. Rama showed Sita vast tracts of land encircled by kingdoms which were formerly bestowed upon Ikshvaku by emperor Manu. Graceful Rama, best among men with a voice resembling that of an intoxicated swan, called the charioteer again and again and said: When shall I return and reunite with my father and mother and go hunting in the blooming forest on the bank of the river Sarayu? In this world, hunting is a unique pleasure. It is regarded as a delightful sport for royal sages. But I do not have a great longing for hunting in the forest on the bank of river Sarayu. In this world, hunting in the woods is a pleasure for royal sages and is greatly sought after by bowmen. This was later resorted to by others. The descendant of Ikshvaku related to the charioteer in a sweet voice the thoughts that came to him and went on the way (continued his journey).       Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having crossed the vast, beautiful kingdom of Kosala, the sagacious elder brother of Lakshmana stood facing Ayodhya with folded palms and said: O Ayodhya, the best of cities ruled by those born in the Kakutstha race I take leave of you and of all those gods inhabiting and guarding you. On completion of exile and my filial obligations to king Dasaratha, lord of the world, discharged, I shall, reunited with my parents, see you again. He looked miserable, his copperred eyes filled with tears. He raised his right hand and said to the villagers who had come to see him: You have aptly shown your kindness and compassion to me. It is not proper to prolong one's grief. So do go and altend to your duties. All of them paid their homage by circumambulating the highsouled Rama. Crying bitterly, they stood here and there. Not yet satisfied (they wanted to linger longer), they stood weeping, while Rama went out of sight just as the Sun disappears at nightfall. Rama, the best  of men, crossed the auspicious land of Kosala which was worth seeing by kings. It looked charming with sacrificial posts and altars, pleasure gardens and mango groves and tanks filled with water. It was rich with herds of cattle, wealth and foodgrains. It was inhabited by charitable, contented and wellnourished people free from fear from any quarter. And it reverberated with the sounds of Vedic recitations.

It was inhabited by charitable, contented and wellnourished people free from fear from any quarter. And it reverberated with the sounds of Vedic recitations. Rama, the greatest among those endowed with fortitude, travelled through the middle of the kingdom which was pleasing, prosperous and full of ravishing gardens fit to be enjoyed by kings. There Rama saw the holy Ganga flowing in three (worlds) with her sacred waters, free from moss, and worshipped by sages. The holy Ganga, adorned with graceful hermitages situated not far away is visited at times by delightful nymphs who sport in her lakes. The Ganga is graced by devatas, danavas, gandharvas and kinneras. Wives of several gandharvas always visit this auspicious river. Since this river flows through heavens for the gods, it is wellknown as 'Devapadmini' where celestial lotuses grow. The river embraces hundreds of hills serving as sporting places and pleasuregardens for gods. The sound of dashing waters of the Ganga is like her laughter and the foam like her sparkling smile. Here she flows straight like the braid of a maiden and there in whirlpools. Here the Ganga runs deep but quiet, there she looks perturbed due to fastflowing waters, here she flows with a deep groan and there with a dreadful roar. Here hosts of celestials take their ablutions and there she shines with lilies of pure blue. Here her banks are curved and there her bed is dotted with patches of white sand. The river reverberates with the cries of swans, cranes and chakravakas (ruddy goose). It rings intermittently with the chirpings of birds charged with endless pasison. Here on her banks stand trees adorned as though with garlands, and there in her waters abound fullblown lilies and a forest of lotuses. Here she is decked with hosts of waterlilies and halfblown flowers while elsewhere she looks intoxicated with the pollen fallen from various flowers. The river, cleansed of heaps of impurities, appears like a transparent gem. The interiors of forests on her banks always resounds with the trumpeting of mighty, intoxicated, wild elephants guarding the quarters, fit to be the vehicles of gods. Just like a lady, Ganga is decorated with the best of ornaments her banks are filled with fruits, flowers, tender leaves or shoots and (flowering) shrubs. It is inhabited by birds and brahmins and infested with sisumaras (small whales), crocodiles and serpents.

                "Deeply moved to see Lakshmana, scion of the Raghus, keeping awake all night without any pretence for his brother's sake, Guha spoke. O dear prince this comfortable bed has been arranged for you. Rest happily on this bed. We are used to all kinds of suffering and you, to comfort. We will keep vigil during the night for the protection of Rama, descendant of the Kakutsthas. For me, there is none dearer than Rama in this world. I speak the truth. I swear by truth. I am seeking supreme fame in this world through the attainment of dharma and acquisition of abundant artha by the grace of Rama alone. I along with my kinsmen, bow in hand, will protect my dear friend, Rama with Sita from every side. Wandering about in this forest all the time there is nothing unknown to me (here). We can withstand even  a vast army of four divisions. Lakshmana said to Guha, O sinless one when all of us are under your righteous protection we have nothing to fear. When Rama, son of Dasaratha, sleeps on the ground with Sita how can I sleep or live or enjoy pleasures? Look at that Rama whom all the gods and demons cannot face in war sleeps so comfortably on the grass with Sita. This favourite son of Dasaratha who has similar traits like his father was born after he rigorously practised austerities accompanied by (Vedic) mantras. When he is banished, the king will not live long. Surely this land will soon be widowed. This favourite son of Dasaratha who has similar traits like his father was born after he rigorously practised austerities accompanied by (Vedic) mantras. When he is banished, the king will not live long. Surely this land will soon be widowed. All the women having cried so much must have quietened down out of sheer exhaustion. That is why perhaps the sounds from the royal palace have ceased. I doubt whether all of them -- the king, Kausalya and my mother -- can survive this night. My mother may live looking forward to Satrughna. But, alas Kausalya may die, separated from her valiant son. That city (of Ayodhya) is full of loyal people. It brings them happiness. It is dear to them. It will perish due to the sad demise of the king. How can the noble king survive unable to see his highsouled, beloved, eldest son? Subsequent to the death of the king, Kausalya will die and my mother will follow her. Past is past (irreversible). My father, brooding over his desire of installing Rama as king unfulfilled, will perish. Those who will remain present around the king, my father, at the time of his death and perform the funeral rites have their desires fulfilled (for they could attend the king's obsequies). They will roam about happily in the capital city of my father with its lovely squares, wellaligned broad highways, its mansions and palaces, full of chariots, elephants, horses. It will be echoing with the sound of trumpets. It will be full of the welfare of all. It will be graced by the fairest of courtesans. Filled with wellnourished and contented people, the city dotted with several pleasuregardens and parks, will look splendid with community festivals and fairs.

Filled with wellnourished and contented people, the city dotted with several pleasuregardens and parks, will look splendid with community festivals and fairs. Will the king be still alive? Will we see the noble king again on our return from exile after the fulfilment of his vows? Will we ever be able, after completion of the exile, to enter the city of Ayodhya along with Rama who is true to his promise? While that noble prince (Lakshmana), tormented with grief, stood thus wailing, the night passed off. Out of great friendship with Guha, Lakshmana thus told the true story of prince (Rama) in the interest of his subject (Guha). (On hearing it) Guha was deeply afflicted with grief and pain and began shedding tears like an elephant suffering from fever.        Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As the night advanced towards dawn, broadchested Rama of great renown said to Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, who had auspicious marks on his body: O dear Lakshmana the holy night is over and it is time for sunrise. The deep dark bird, the cuckoo is singing. Listen to the screams of the peacocks in the forest. The Ganga is flowing fast to merge in the sea. We need to cross it. In response to Rama's desire, Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, one who brings joy to his friends, called Guha and the charioteer (Sumantra) and stood before his brother. Having heard and accepted Rama's proposal, the king of the nisadas called his ministers at once and said: Get quickly to the sacred bank (of  Ganga) a strong, auspicious boat equipped with rowing rods and helmsmen who can help cross the river with ease The ministers heard the orders, soon brought  a beautiful boat and informed Guha (that his orders have been carried out). Then Guha with folded palms said to Rama: O king, the boat ready. Tell me what else can I do for you. O best among men, renowned like a god's son and constantly engaged in vows, here is the boat for you to cross the Ganga flowing into the sea. Do board it. Thereafter the radiant Rama said to Guha, You have fulfilled my desire. Keep all our belongings in the boat. Rama and Lakshmana then put on their quivers, fastened their swords and holding their bows went towards Ganga along with Sita. The charioteer (Sumantra) approached the righteous Rama and asked him with folded hands: What can I do? Rama then caressed  Sumantra with his right hand and said, Sumantra, go back immediately and never be inattentive in serving the king. You have done enough. I shall now leave the chariot and walk into the great forest. Having been permitted to go, Sumantra, the distressed charioteer, said to Rama, the best among men, and a descendant of the Ikshvaku race: None else in this world would be able to live in the forest as you have resolved to, like a common man, along with your brother and spouse. If your celibacy and your grief are the consequences of your study of the Vedic lore, your compassionate nature and simplicity of character, I think there is no use of all these (virtues). Valiant scion of the Raghus dwelling in the forest along with Vaidehi (Sita) and brother Lakshmana you will attain the status as if you have won the three worlds. Deprived of you, O Rama we will come under the control of that sinful Kaikeyi. We will suffer and die. Rama was like his (Sumantra's) own self. When Sumantra, the charioteer, saw that  Rama was preparing to go afar for a long time, he started weeping aloud in deep distress. After the flow of tears ceased Sumantra took a sip of water and became sanctified. Then Rama addressed him with sweet words over and over again: I find none else like you as friendly as you are to the Ikshvaku race. So do whatever you like  to see that king Dasaratha does not brood over me. I tell you this because the lord of the earth (Dasaratha), is in deep distress. He is old. And he is under the control of his passion. To make Kaikeyi  happy, do whatever little the great king Dasaratha orders you to do. The minds of kings create no hurdles in all that they want to do. That is why they rule kingdoms. Sumantra do things exactly in the manner the great king desires so that he does not feel sad or disappointed. After offering your salutations, tell these words, on my behalf, to the king who is respectable, bent with age and who has conquered his senses and never experienced any sorrow before. I do not regret my banishment from Ayodhya to live in the forest. Neither Lakshmana nor Sita does. Very quickly these fourteen years will come to an end and we will return (to Ayodhya). Then you will see me, Lakshmana and Sita off and on. Having said this to the king, O Sumantra tell my mother, the other queens including Kaikeyi again and again about my wellbeing and the wellbeing of Lakshmana and Sita. Convey our respectful salutations at the feet of mother Kausalya. Having said this to the king, O Sumantra tell my mother, the other queens including Kaikeyi again and again about my wellbeing and the wellbeing of Lakshmana and Sita. Convey our respectful salutations at the feet of mother Kausalya. Tell the king to send for Bharata quickly, and on his arrival, he be placed in the position of the king as per his own desire. On embracing Bharata and making him the crownprince the sorrow due to our departure will not affect you. You should tell Bharata that just as he treats the king so should he treat all the mothers without differentiating betwen them. Just as you treat Kaikeyi and Sumitra in a special manner, so should you treat Devi Kausalya, my mother. Princeregency is awaiting you because of our father's loving desire. See that through you (your actions) he is able to attain happiness in both the worlds. When Sumantra was asked by Rama to go back, he grew griefstricken. Having heard all that was said by the scion of the Kakutsthas, he replied: I beg your pardon for what I have told you out of love. Accept it as the words of a devotee expressed without fear or formality. Without you how can I go back to the city (of Ayodhya) which, separated from you, is grieving like a lady who has lost her son? The people who had seen Rama board the chariot will be brokenhearted to see it without him. Seeing the empty chariot the people of the city will look pitiable just like an army left only with the charioteer after its hero is killed in the war. Although living at a distance, the subjects feel in their minds that you are just ahead of them. Today they will certainly go without food, brooding over you. At the time of your departure, O Rama, you have seen all that happened, the hearts of the people exhausted with grief. You have witnessed the cry of agony raised by the citizens at the time of your banishment. Now when they see the (empty) chariot, they will make it (raise their cry) a hundredfold. What shall I say to Kausalya? Shall I say 'O venerable queen I have left your son at his maternal uncle's, hence don't grieve'. How can I lie to her? How can I tell her the unpleasent truth? How can these excellent horses who used to carry you and your friends till now draw this chariot without you even though they are at my command? That is why, O sinless one I cannot go back to Ayodhya without you. Allow me to accompany you into your exile. If you forsake me in spite of my request I shall immediately enter fire along with my chariot. With my chariot I shall retaliate and prevent all those animals in the forest causing obstacles to your austerities, O Rama By your grace I experienced the pleasure of driving your chariot, and by your grace, too, I am looking forward to deriving the pleasure of dwelling in the forest. Be pleased. I wish to stay with you in the forest I long to hear from you these favourable words, 'Stay with me'. O valiant one, if these horses too could render services to you while you dwell in the forest, they would attain the supreme state. As I dwell in the forest, I shall serve you with my head bowed. For this I may altogether relinquish Ayodhya or even heaven. Just as a sinner cannot enter the capital of Indra (heaven), it is impossible for me to enter Ayodhya without you. It is my cherished desire to take you after the completion of your exile, back to the city (Ayodhya) in this chariot alone. If I accompany you into the forest, fourteen years will pass like a moment, otherwise it will seem like a hundred years. O Rama you are affectionate towards your servants. I abide in the path followed by you, my master's son. I am your devoted servant. It does not behove you to forsake me who is faithful. Repeatedly implored in various ways by the miserable Sumantra, Rama who is compassionate to his servants replied: O Sumantra, listen I know your deep devotion to me (I also know) you are loyal to your master (Dasaratha). So I am sending you to the city (Ayodhya) from here. When my younger mother Kaikeyi sees that you have returned to Ayodhya, she will believe that Rama has really gone to the forest. If queen Kaikeyi is fully satisfied that I have gone to dwell in the forest, she will no longer have any doubt and will believe that righteous king Dasaratha is not a liar. My prime resolve is that my younger mother should enjoy this prosperous and vast kingdom ruled by her son Bharata. Sumantra, return to the city with the chariot for my pleasure and also for the pleasure of the king and convey to each of the persons concerned the message exactly as instructed. Having spoken to the charioteer and consoling him again and again, indefatigable Rama spoke to Guha words full of reasoning: Guha this forest where people live is not suitable for my stay. It is necessary that I live in a hermitage. So please do the needful. Seeking the welfare of my father, Sita and Lakshmana I shall enter the forest with matted hair and practise the prescribed austerities which are the adornments of ascetics. Do fetch me the sap of a banyan tree. Guha fetched the latex quickly and gave it to the prince (Rama) and with that Rama matted his own hair and  Lakshmana's. The longarmed Rama, the best of men, put on locks of matted hair. As the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana stood dressed in bark wearing crowns of matted hair, they resembled two resplendent ascetics. The longarmed Rama, the best of men, put on locks of matted hair. As the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana stood dressed in bark wearing crowns of matted hair, they resembled two resplendent ascetics. Having adopted the path of ascetics along with Lakshmana, Rama said to his friend Guha: O Guha you must be vigilant about your army, treasury, forts and provinces. A kingdom, it is (rightly) said, is protected with great difficulty. Rama, Delight of the Iksvakus, then permitted Guha to take leave. And departed quickly with his consort and Lakshmana in peace. Seeing the boat on the river bank and intending to cross the swiftly flowing Ganga, Rama, descendant of the Iksvakus said to Lakshmana: O Lakshmana, the best of men the boat stands ready, get into it slowly (carefully), and then help the noble Sita board it by holding the beam (which balances the boat). Having heard his brother's command the selfcontrolled Lakshmana did as he was told.He first helped Sita get into the boat and  thereafter boarded it himself. With the boat boarded by the glorious Rama, Lakshmana's elder brother, Guha, king of the nishadas urged his kinsmen (to row the boat). Resplendent Rama boarded the boat and muttered for his own safety mantras befitting brahmins and kshatriyas. Rama of undimmed radiance sipped the waters (of the Ganga) in accordance with the scriptures and with great pleasure and paid obeisance to the river with Sita and Lakshmana. Having permitted Sumantra and Guha with his army to leave, Rama seated on the boat urged the boatmen to proceed. The wellruddered boat rowed by the helmsmen and propelled by strong oars, swiftly crossed the waters of the river. When the boat reached the midstream that unblemished Sita with palms folded invoked the river thus: O Ganga, protected by you, this son (Rama) of Dasaratha, the sagacious maharaja, will carry out his father's command. He along with his brother will return after living in the forest for full fourteen years. O fortunate Devi, he will worship you in delight for fulfilling all his desires after his safe return. O Ganga, protected by you, this son (Rama) of Dasaratha, the sagacious maharaja, will carry out his father's command. He along with his brother will return after living in the forest for full fourteen years. O fortunate Devi, he will worship you in delight for fulfilling all his desires after his safe return. O Ganga, protected by you, this son (Rama) of Dasaratha, the sagacious maharaja, will carry out his father's command. He along with his brother will return after living in the forest for full fourteen years. O fortunate Devi, he will worship you in delight for fulfilling all his desires after his safe return. O Devi, you are Tripathaga, flowing in three directions (worlds). You behold the region of Brahma and happen to be the spouse of the king of the ocean in this world (of mortals). O Devi O lovely Ganga I offer you my obeisance and my adorations. After the safe return of Rama, the tiger (best) among men, from the forest and after he regains the kingdom I shall give a hundred thousand cows, clothing and delicious food to brahmins as a mark of regard, which will please you. O Devi O lovely Ganga I offer you my obeisance and my adorations. After the safe return of Rama, the tiger (best) among men, from the forest and after he regains the kingdom I shall give a hundred thousand cows, clothing and delicious food to brahmins as a mark of regard, which will please you. O Devi after my return to Ayodhya  purified by my austerities, I shall worship you by offering a thousand pots of nectar and food in the form of meat. I shall worship all those deities inhabiting your banks and all sacred spots and temples. O sacred one may the blemishless, mightyarmed Rama accompanied by me and his brother reenter Ayodhya after the exile. While the unblemished, auspicious Sita was thus addressing (the river), the boat swiftly reached the south bank. Rama, the best of men and tormentor of enemies, after  reaching  the other side of the river, left the boat and proceeded with Sita and his brother. The longarmed Rama then said to Lakshmana,  enhancer of the joy of Sumitra: Whether in populated areas  or in solitary places, excercise alacrity in the matter of protection. In this desolate forest which we had never seen before we must certainly be concerned about our protection. O Lakshmana , let Sita follow you O best of men, I will follow you and Sita and keep watch. We must ensure  mutual protection. We have not yet confronted any hardship. From now on Sita will come to know the difficulties of forest life. Now she will enter the forest which is devoid of concourse of people, farms and pleasure groves and which is uneven and inaccessible and full of deep ditches. Having heard the words of Rama, Lakshmana went ahead and Rama, delight of the Raghus, walked behind Sita. The wretched Sumantra kept gazing at Rama who swiftly reached the other side of the Ganga and only when he could not see him because of long distance, he turned away his gaze and, overcome with grief, shed tears. Having crossed that mighty river, the highsouled Rama, bestower of boons and equal in splendour, to the Protector of the world reached Vatsa by and by, a highly prosperous country inhabited by happy people. Famished, they (Rama and Lakshmana) killed a boar, a rishya (whitefooted male antelope), a spotted deer and a great deer with black stripes. They partook the meat and reached a tree by evening where they rested for the night.        Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Ayodhyakanda of  the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On reaching the foot of the tree, Rama offered oblations to Sandhya of the west. And then he who is the best in keeping people in good humour said to Lakshmana: We will have to spend this first night without Sumantra and away from human habitation. (Yet) you need not worry. O Lakshmana, from now on we must be sleeplessly vigilant at night. The welfare and safety of Sita depend on us both. O Lakshmana, we will have to somehow pass this night, sleeping on the ground spread with whatever we have procured. Rama who deserved a luxurious bed lay down on the ground and uttered these beneficial words to Lakshamana: O Lakshmana, the maharaja must be having a painful sleep tonight. But Kaikeyi with her desires fulfilled, ought to feel satisfied. After the arrival of Bharata, I hope queen Kaikeyi does not deprive the king of his life for the sake of the kingdom? That lustful king, having come under the hold of Kaikeyi, has been deprived of my presence. What can that forlorn and aged king do? Reflecting on the calamity and mental aberration of the king, I think passion is stronger than wealth and righteousness. O Lakshmana, will even an illiterate man for the sake of a woman ever abandon his son like me who is faithful and obedient, as did my father? Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, with his wife will alone enjoy like an emperor this kingdom of Kosala full of happy people. The king is advanced in age and I have to dwell in the forest. Therefore, Bharata alone will be the chief of this entire kingdom. Any king who abandons dharma and artha and adopts a life of pleasure will very soon reach this state as Dasaratha has attained. O handsome Lakshmana I think Kaikeyi has come to our house for the destruction of Dasaratha, for my banishment and enthronement of Bharata in the kingdom. Intoxicated with her good fortune will not Kaikeyi torment Kausalya and Sumitra for my sake? O Lakshmana, because of me mother Sumitra should not live in sorrow. Therefore, tomorrow morning go back to Ayodhya from here itself. I shall go with Sita into the Dandaka forest and you be the protector of the helpless, Kausalya. Kaikeyi who is a woman of heinous deeds may follow, out of hostility, an unjust way in respect of my mother. In that case my mother may be entrusted to the care of Bharata who is righteous. O Lakshmana, surely in one of her previous births did my mother separate women from their sons. That is why this (calamity) has befallen her. Kausalya nurtured me for a long time and reared me with great difficulty. When she was going to enjoy the fruits of her labour, I have been separated from her. Fie upon me O Lakshmana, I am causing endless sorrow to my mother. May no mother give birth to a son like me (On hearing my banishment) her myna would say to her parrot, 'O parrot, bite the foot of the enemy (Kaikeyi)'. I think  that bird is  a greater source of joy to my mother than I, O Lakshmana My mother has less fortune and more grief like a woman without a son, O Lakshmana, subduer of enemies For her, what is the use of a son like me who cannot render any service to her? My mother is unlucky as she has been separated from me. Extremely distressed, she must have plunged into an ocean of grief. Once enraged, O Lakshmana I can overpower Ayodhya, even the whole world all by myself with my arrows. But exhibition of prowess without any reason is not desirable. O sinless one, I did not get myself coronated owing to fear of unrighteous conduct and fear of the other world. Like this and in many other ways Rama lamented pitifully in that desolate forest. When his face was filled with tears, he sat silently in the night. Lakshmana consoled Rama who ceased to lament like fire with extinguished flames or like a motionless sea: O Rama, foremost of warriors, it is certain that since your departure, the city of Ayodhya must be lustreless like night without the Moon. This is not the way you should lament, O Rama. O foremost of men, by doing so you are disheartening me and Sita as well. Without you Sita or I will not survive even for a moment like a fish taken out of water, O Rama Without you, O Rama, tormentor of enemies, I wish to see neither father nor Satrughna nor Sumitra nor even heaven itself Thereafter Rama and Sita, the duo, nurturers of righteousness, from their comfortable  seats moved to the bed wellmade under the banyan tree not far (from there where they were sitting) and lay down (to sleep). Rama, the tormentor of enemies, listened, out of love, to the excellent and copious words of Lakshmana and permitted him to live in the forest for the entire period of fourteen years by observing the prescribed code of conduct as enjoined on  life in the forest. Then the two mighty perpetuators of the Raghu race, who were like two lions dwelling on the slopes of mountains, lived in that lonely forest  without fear or hesitation.       Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "They (Rama, Sita and Lakshmana) spent that auspicious night under that great tree and set out from there after the bright sun rose. Illustrious Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the deep forest and saw the different regions of the land and other enchanting places which they had never seen before and proceeded towards the region where the river Yamuna merged with Bhagirathi Ganga. Illustrious Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the deep forest and saw the different regions of the land and other enchanting places which they had never seen before and proceeded towards the region where the river Yamuna merged with Bhagirathi Ganga. Walking on the safe path and observing various kinds of trees Rama said to Lakshmana at the end of the day: O son of Sumitra, look at the column of smoke rising like the banner of the venerable firegod near Prayaga. I think an ascetic dwells nearby. We have surely reached the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna which can be ascertained from the sounds of clashing water. Here are logs of wood cut into pieces by forestdwellers, living on forest products. You can see various trees near the hermitage of sage Bharadwaja. The two archers (Rama and Lakshmana) reached comfortably (walking at an easy pace) by evening the hermitage of sage Bharadwaja near the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna. Seeing Rama approaching the hermitage the deer and the birds were frightened. Proceeding on the path, for a while Rama reached (the place of) Bharadwaja. Thereafter the two heroes followed by Sita arrived at the hermitage and, wishing to see the sage, waited at a distance. Rama entered the hermitage and saw that highsouled Bharadwaja surrounded by his disciples. He was a distinguished sage who (himself) kindled sacrficial fires and acquired spiritual insight by practising rigid austerities with concentration of mind and ascetic powers. Rama, Lakshmana and Sita paid their obeisance to that great sage. Rama entered the hermitage and saw that highsouled Bharadwaja surrounded by his disciples. He was a distinguished sage who (himself) kindled sacrficial fires and acquired spiritual insight by practising rigid austerities with concentration of mind and ascetic powers. Rama, Lakshmana and Sita paid their obeisance to that great sage. Lakshmana's elder brother (Rama) introduced himself (to Bharadwaja), O venerable one, we are both sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana. This blessed one is my consort, Sita, daughter of Janaka. Irreproachable she has followed me to the desolate grove of penance (hermitage). This is the son of Sumitra, my beloved younger brother, a man of firm resolve. He has accompanied me when I was sent on exile to the forest by my father. O venerable one on my father's command we entered the desolate forest of penance. Subsisting on roots and fruits, I shall practise the righteous way of life. Sage Bharadwaja heard the words of sagacious Rama and offered a bull, water (for washing feet) and arghya (offering to a guest). The ascetic who practised severe penance offered them different kinds of food and drink made from roots and fruits available in the forest. He also provided them a place to rest in. There the sage sat, surrounded by hermits, animals and birds after having welcomed Rama with due honour. Rama accepted the hospitality of Bharadwaja and took a seat in front of the sage, who spoke to him these words in conformity with righteousness: O descendant of the Kakutstha dynasty, I am able to see you on your arrival here after a long time. I have also heard about your unwarranted banishment. This sacred and solitary region near the confluence of two great rivers (Ganga and Yamuna) is a pleasant place. You may stay here comfortably. Rama, ever devoted to the wellbeing of every one, heard Bharadwaja and replied to him with these auspicious words: O venerable sage, I feel the people living in nearby villages and towns, perceiving that we can be easily seen here, will frequent this ashram. This is the reason I don't wish to stay here. O venerable sage, I feel the people living in nearby villages and towns, perceiving that we can be easily seen here, will frequent this ashram. This is the reason I don't wish to stay here. O revered one, Janaka's daughter (Sita) deserves comfort. Suggest a solitary and agreeable place for our hermitage where she can enjoy herself. On hearing the auspicious words of Rama conveying his intention, the great sage Bharadwaja replied to him thus: O my son ten krosas (about twenty miles) from here is a mountain wellknown as  Chitrakuta, resembling 'Gandhamadana'. That mountain frequented by maharshis is sacred. It looks pleasant from all sides. Monkeys, apes and bears wander there and it is an appropriate place for you to live in. O my son ten krosas (about twenty miles) from here is a mountain wellknown as  Chitrakuta, resembling 'Gandhamadana'. That mountain frequented by maharshis is sacred. It looks pleasant from all sides. Monkeys, apes and bears wander there and it is an appropriate place for you to live in. As long as one beholds the peaks of mount Chitrakuta, he will be inspired to do good deeds and will not employ his mind in sinful thoughts. On the Chitrakuta mountain many ascetics wandered about (lived) for hundreds of years carrying on penance. In the process they became so much emaciated that they looked as if they were left (only) with the skulls on their heads. (In the end) they ascended heaven. O Rama, I think you will enjoy your stay there in a solitary place. Or else, you may live with me here during the period of banishment. Bharadwaja, who knows his duty honoured Rama, his beloved guest with his consort and brother by extending all kinds of hospitality. At Prayaga, while the great sage Bharadwaja was narrating to Rama sitting near him several interesting anecdotes, the holy night set in. The exhausted scion of the Kakutsthas, used to comforts, stayed in the lovely hermitage of Bharadwaja for the night with Sita, as the third member (of the group). When the night passed into dawn, Rama the best of men approached the resplendent Bharadwaja and said. O venerable sage devoted to truth, we have spent the night in your hermitage. Please permit us to depart for the dwellingplace (suggested by you). When the night came to a close, Bharadwaja said (to Rama): You may proceed to Chitrakuta which abounds in roots, fruits and honey. O mighty Rama, I think mount Chitrakuta is the right place for you to stay. Go there. That mountain is full of trees of every kind, is inhabited by kinneras and uragas (serpents). It echoes with the cries of peacocks, is frequented by mighty tuskers. Filled with fruits and roots, it is sacred and pleasant.

It echoes with the cries of peacocks, is frequented by mighty tuskers. Filled with fruits and roots, it is sacred and pleasant. You will see, O Rama, herds of elephants and deer ranging in the forest. Your heart will be filled with joy while you wander with Sita beholding rivers, waterfalls, plateaus, caverns and mountaintorrents. The auspicious mountain (Chaitrakuta) resounds with the note of cheerful lapwings and cuckoos. Intoxicated elephants and deer move about in the enchanting mountain. There you may settle down in a hermitage.        Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After spending the night, the princes, destroyers of enemies, offered obeisance to that great sage (Bharadhwaja) and went towards that mount Chitrkuta. Seeing them setting forth, the great sage blessed them for a safe journey and followed them like a father following his children. Then that great effulgent sage Bharadwaja began to speak to Rama whose strength was truth. Reaching the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna, O Rama and Lakshmana best among men proceed along the Kalindi (Yamuna) river flowing westward. On reaching that swiftflowing river Yamuna, O Rama and Lakshmana O scions of the Raghu race, you will find an ancient spot (on the river bank). There make a raft and cross Kalindi, daughter of the Sun. There you will find a large, banyan tree with its lush green leaves, looking dark with its densely grown trees. It is inhabited by siddhas. Sita should offer with folded palms invocations for her wellbeing. There you will find a large, banyan tree with its lush green leaves, looking dark with its densely grown trees. It is inhabited by siddhas. Sita should offer with folded palms invocations for her wellbeing. Reaching that tree, you may tarry or proceed further. A krosa from there, you will see a beautiful forest filled with dark trees mixed with Palasas and badaris and bamboos on the Yamuna. That path leads to Chitrakuta. I had travelled through it several times. It is beautiful, smooth and safe from forest fires. The great sage returned after instructing Rama about the path. So be it, said Rama and offering obeisance requested Bharadhwaja to go back. With the sage gone, Rama said, O Saumitri (son of Sumitra) we are lucky, for the sage has been so kind. Thus talking with one another, the two nobleminded tigers (best) among men advanced towards river Kalindi (Yamuna) with Sita walking in front. Thereafter, they all reached the rapidly flowing river Kalindi and began pondering how to cross it. Then they both made a big wooden float by joining logs of wood, spreading bamboos on it and covering it with the (fragrant roots of) Ushira bushes. The valiant Lakshmana cut the stems of reeds and branches of the Jambu tree to prepare a comfortable seat for Sita (on that float). Rama, son of Dasaratha helped his beloved (Sita), who was looking inconceivably like Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and was feeling a little bashful while stepping on to the float. Rama placed robes and ornaments on the float by the side of Sita and a spade and a basket along with weapons. Those valiant sons of Dasaratha held the float (firmly) to help Sita step on to it. Then they crossed the river carefully. On reaching the middle of the river Yamuna, Sita made reverential salutations to her saying O goddess, I am crossing you, may safety be ours and may my husband fulfil his vow After Rama's (safe) return to the city (of Ayodhya) ruled by the Ikshvaku kings, I shall worship you with a thousand cows and a hundred pots of wine. On reaching the middle of the river Yamuna, Sita made reverential salutations to her saying O goddess, I am crossing you, may safety be ours and may my husband fulfil his vow After Rama's (safe) return to the city (of Ayodhya) ruled by the Ikshvaku kings, I shall worship you with a thousand cows and a hundred pots of wine. While Sita with her fair complexion was thus invoking river Yamuna with folded hands they reached the southern bank. They crossed the swiftflowing river Yamuna, daughter of the Sungod, full of waves and with trees growing thick on her banks. Having crossed the river, they left the float and proceeded from the adjoining forest of Yamuna and reached the dark, cool banyan tree covered with lush green leaves. Having reached the banyan tree, Sita invoked it, saying, 'O great tree I offer you my salutations. May my husband fulfil his vow May I behold Kausalya and the illustrious Sumitra on my return. Saying so, she went round the tree offering reverential salutations with folded hands. Having reached the banyan tree, Sita invoked it, saying, 'O great tree I offer you my salutations. May my husband fulfil his vow May I behold Kausalya and the illustrious Sumitra on my return. Saying so, she went round the tree offering reverential salutations with folded hands. Beholding the obedient, blemishless, beloved Sita invoking blessings, Rama said to Lakhsmana: O Lakshmana, best among bipeds (men) and brother of Bharata walk ahead with Sita and I shall follow with weapons. Whatever fruit or flower the daughter of Janaka asks for, get it. Whatever pleases her mind give it. The daughter of Janaka walked between them like a sheelephant between two males. That gentle lady enquired of Rama about a tree or a shrub or a creeper in full bloom which she did not see before. Cheered by Sita's indents, Lakshmana brought her various beautiful plants and stocks of flowers. Beholding the river Yamuna with its wonderful water and sand echoing with the cackle of swans and cranes, Sita went ecstatic. After walking a krosa into the forest on the bank of Yamuna, the two brothers killed many deer suitable for sacrifice and ate them. They reached the tableland on the bank of that river and moved in high spirit in the lovely forest resounding with cries of flocks of peacocks and teeming with monkeys and elephants. Finally they selected  a spot for their stay.       Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the night was over, Rama, Delight of the Raghus, gently awakened Lakshmana who was asleep. Listen to the songs of the forest birds, O son of Sumitra O tormentor of foes it is time we set out. Awakened by his brother in time, Lakshmana shook off his sleep, his drowsiness and his fatigue due to journey. Then they all rose, touched the river's auspicious waters and went the way the sage had directed -- towards mount Chitrakuta. Early in the morning Rama set out with Lakshmana and said this to Sita with eyes like lotus petals: O daughter of Videha behold these kimsuka trees in full bloom everywhere. With the passing of winter, they appear bright as though they are garlanded by their own flowers. Behold these bhallataka trees in full bloom though there are none to enjoy them. They are bent with fruits and leaves. Surely, we can live here. (This place is fit for our habitation). O Lakshmana see the honeycombs of the size of wooden vessels crowded by the honeybees hanging down from every tree. In this delightful forest region strewn with fallen flowers the peacock is responding to the screaming of natyuha bird. See these flocks of singing birds followed by herds of elephants. See this mount Chitrakuta with its towering peaks. O dear this sacred forest of Chitrakuta standing on a level land is full of various trees. Let us enjoy it. Then they both along with Sita walked to that lovely, delightful Chitrakuta mountain. Rama arrived at that enchanting mountain full of various kinds of birds, fruits and roots, and sweet water. (And said to Lakshmana:) O gentle one this enchanting mountain with different kinds of trees and creepers and many roots and fruits appears to be a happy place to live in. Great sages reside on this high mountain. Let it be our habitation and let us enjoy our life here, O handsome one Thus Rama, Sita and Lakshmana approached the hermitage of sage Valmiki and paid obeisance to him with folded hands. The great sage Valmiki conversant with righteousness was delighted. He honoured them by extending welcome and said 'Be seated'. The mightyarmed elder brother of Lakshmana revealed his identity to the sage by duly introducing himself. And said then to Lakshmana: O handsome Lakshmana, make a hut with strong, sound logs of wood. My mind impels me to stay here. Having heard Rama, Saumitri, the subduer of enemies fetched different kinds of logs of wood, and with them made a hut and thatched it with leaves. Rama saw the goodlooking leafhut with mats tied around as walls, and said to Lakshmana who was awaiting further command with rapt attention: O Lakshmana those who intend to live for long (in this hut), should pacify the deity presiding over here. Therefore, we shall bring the venison of a black antelope and make necessary offerings. Slay an antelope and bring it here quickly. O Lakshmana The rites as prescribed by the scriptures will have to be carried out. You may recollect that tradition. Lakshmana, slayer of heroes on the enemy's side, understood and implemented what he was told. Rama again said to him: Cook this venison, O handsome one We will offer it to the presiding deity of this hut. Hasten, the day and time are fixed (for the rites) Then the powerful son of Sumitra killed a black antelope fit for offering, and offered it to the wellkindled fire. With the blood drained out of the venison, Lakshmana roasted it and cooked it well, and then said to Rama, the tiger (best) among men. This black antelope with all its limbs is wellcooked. O divine sire, you may make the offering to Vastu devata in which you are proficient. Virtuous Rama, who was an expert in the recitation of mantras, took his bath and his mind controlled, intoned briefly all the mantras appropriate to the completion of the ritual. Sanctified with the worship of all the gods, Rama of immeasurable lustre felt a great happiness on entering the hut. Rama, offered oblations to Visvadevas, Rudra and Visnu,  performed the auspices for the appeasement of the household deity. And having muttered japa silently in conformity with tradition, he took his ablution in the river as enjoined (by the sastras) and offered his final oblations for the expiation of his sins. Rama, offered oblations to Visvadevas, Rudra and Visnu,  performed the auspices for the appeasement of the household deity. And having muttered japa silently in conformity with tradition, he took his ablution in the river as enjoined (by the sastras) and offered his final oblations for the expiation of his sins. Rama, son of the Raghus, made altars in all the quarters, places of worship and sacred spots for fire befitting a hermitage. Bestowed with auspicious qualities, Rama and Lakshmana along with Sita propitiated those celestial beings with garlands of forest flowers, fruits and roots, wellcooked venison, water, muttering of prayers as expounded in the Vedas, faggots and kusa grass and entered that auspicious hermitage. Just like the gods enter the court of Sudharma, they all stepped into the hut to dwell there. The hut was charming wellbuilt on a suitable site and protected against storm. Then they with their senses conquered, enjoyed perfect happiness in that splendid forest teeming with many varieties of animals and birds, with trees full of brilliant clusters of flowers and echoing with the sounds of wild animals. Having reached the marvellous mount Chitrakuta and river Malyavati with excellent holy places and full of animals and birds, Rama shed the sorrow of his banishment from the city (of Ayodhya) and rejoiced with a gladdened heart.       Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of  the  holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Until Rama reached the southern bank, Guha kept talking with Sumantra for long and returned home with great sorrow. Positioned there, they could mark their arrival at Bharadwaja's at Prayaga, their stay (nighthalt) and their onward journey to Chitrakuta mountain. Permitted by Rama to leave, Sumantra harnessed the best of horses and set out for the city of Ayodhya with a heavy heart. Beholding the fragrancefilled forests, rivers, lakes, villages and  towns on the way, Sumantra quickly crossed them. The charioteer reached Ayodhya on the third day at dusk and found the city cheerless. Beholding the silent city, almost empty, the deeply depressed Sumantra, afflicted with gushing tears reflected: Has the city along with its elephants, horses, people and its king perished in the fire of grief for Rama? Absorbed in these thoughts, the charioteer came to the citygate, carried by the swiftfooted horses, and quickly entered the city. Meanwhile as the charioteer was moving towards the city, hundreds and thousands of men came pouring towards him enquiring, 'Where is Rama?' I took leave of the great, righteous Rama on the bank of the Ganga and have returned with his permission. (replied Sumantra). Hearing that they had (the trio) crossed the river Ganga, the people, with their faces filled with tears sighed and saying 'Fie upon us Alas, Rama' cried out aloud. He saw them gathering in groups, saying, Henceforth we will not be able to see Rama and without him, we are lost indeed. No longer will we see Rama at sacrifices, weddings, great assemblies and at places of charitable activity. Rama looked after his people like a father always thinking what was good for them, dear to them and comfortable to them. (He) heard wailings of women looking through the window and of the people in marketplaces burning with sorrow over Rama's exile. Sumantra with his face muffled, drove along the highway straight to the palace of king Dasaratha. Quickly alighting from the chariot, he entered  the king's palace and crossed the seven courtyards overcrowded with people. Women from mansions, sevenstoried buildings and from royal palaces, sighted him and pained at not seeing Rama cried out 'Alas, Alas'. The women in great anguish stood silently looking at one another, their large eyes flooded with overflowing tears. From different spots in the palace, Sumantra heard the sobs and whispers of Dasaratha's wives who were tormented with the sorrow of Rama's exile. The charioteer left with Rama and returned without him. What can he say to the wailing Kausalya? I think it is indeed difficult for Kausalya to live wherever and whichever way she tries as she has been separated from her son. (the queens said). Listening to the correct words of the king's wives, he immediately entered the palace as if in flames (of grief). On entering the eighth courtyard, he saw in a pale white chamber king Dasaratha desolate, anguished and withered with the sorrow of separation from his son. Sumantra approached the king who was seated, paid obeisance to him and conveyed Rama's words verbatim. The king silently listened to Rama's message. Bewildered and tormented by the grief of Rama's absence, he fell down on the ground in a swoon. The moment the lord of the earth fell down on the ground unconscious, the women in the inner apartment burst into tears, raising their arms. Having seen her husband collapsed on the ground, Kausalya assisted by Sumitra lifted him up and said to him thus: O distinguished king, why are you not enquiring from the messenger about him  (Rama) who is capable of performing arduous tasks? O descendant of the Raghus are you ashamed of having done an injustice? Arise. you may be a blessed one (for fulfilling your promise). If you grieve, none will help you. Kaikeyi for fear of whom you dare not ask the charioteer about Rama, O king is not here. You may speak to him without fear. Absorbed in grief, Kausalya spoke to the maharaja in a voice choked with tears and then collapsed on the floor. All those women saw weeping Kausalya as well as their husband fallen on the ground and wailed loudly in a chorus. Having heard the sound emanating from the inner apartment, people, old, young and women, of the city lamented. The city was crowded again.       Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the king regained his consciousness and was consoled, he summoned the   charioteer to hear news about Rama. Then the charioteer with folded palms approached the king who, deeply afflicted with grief and pain, was brooding over Rama alone. Aged Dasaratha was heaving deep sighs like a newlycaptured, indisposed elephant. Then the charioteer with folded palms approached the king who, deeply afflicted with grief and pain, was brooding over Rama alone. Aged Dasaratha was heaving deep sighs like a newlycaptured, indisposed elephant. Seeing the dejected charioteer standing before him, the desolate king covered all over with dust and his face bathed in tears, said to him in extreme grief: O charioteer Rama is rightous and he is acustoomed to all sorts of comfort. Taking refuge at the foot of a tree how shall he live and what shall he eat? How can the son of the guardian of the earth who is accustomed to a comfortable bed and not to undeserved suffering lie down on the ground like an orphan, O Sumantra Wherever Rama went, elephants, chariots and footsoldiers followed him. How can he (now) live in the desolate forest where he has taken refuge? How can the two young men along with Vaidehi live in the forest infested with black cobras and wicked, wild animals? O Sumantra how did those two princes along with pitiable, delicate Sita, alight from the chariot, and enter the forest on foot? You are blessed indeed, O charioteer to have seen my sons entering the outskirts of the forest like Aswinis stepping into the region of the Mandara mountain. Upon reaching the forest, O Sumantra what did Rama, Lakshmana and Sita say? Tell me, O charioteer where Rama sat, where he slept, what (food) he ate. Only your words will enable me to live like Yayati among saints. Thus questioned by the king the charioteer, his voice choked with tears and words faltering in grief, addressed the king: With palms folded and head bowed, O great king Rama offered his salutations to you in confirmity with righteousness and said to me: 'Convey on my behalf, O charioteer to my illustrious father who is known for his selfknowledge, and is worthy of homage, that I am saluting his feet with my head bowed. 'On my behalf convey, O charioteer, without any distinction, my salutations to all the women befitting their status and tell them I was enquiring about their wellbeing. 'Convey my mother carefully my saluations and my wellbeing and tell her: 'O mother, adhering to the righteous path and performing in time the rituals in the chamber of sacrificial fire, offer your services at the feet of king Dasaratha as if he were a god. 'O mother, conduct yourself with other mothers without pride and egoism. Ensure that venerable Kaikeyi remains welldisposed towards the king. 'Behave towards young Bharata as to a king. Irrespective of age, a king is a king. (Hence should be honoured). You should keep this rajadharma (royal prerogative) in mind. 'Tell Bharata of my welfare and tell him on my behalf that he should honour all our mothers equally. 'The king is advanced in age. Do not restrict him in any manner. Carry out his orders as prince regent, and live happily'. Shedding profuse tears, Rama continued, 'Look after my mother who is covetous of her son as your own mother'. While saying this the red lotuslike eyes of illustrious Rama streamed with tears, O maharaja But Lakshmana, seething with anger and sighing said, 'For what offence has this king's son  been banished'? 'The king, too, submitting to the trash command of Kaikeyi has perpetrated an act, just or unjust (he knows better), for which we are made to suffer so much. 'Whether it was out of greed (for the kingdom) or for (the execution of) the boon bestowed, this act of banishment is by all means wicked'. 'Or he might have thought he is the overlord and can do as he likes. (Or, he might have done this for fear of God) Otherwise, I do not see any reason for the abandonment of Rama'. 'Unjustly, foolishly and without (proper) consideration Rama has been banished. This will (definitely) cause sorrow'. 'I do not regard the great king as my father. Rama alone is my brother, protector, friend and father. 'How can anyone in this world be pleased with you for deserting Rama, the beloved of all, and ever devoted to their welfare? 'Having banished the righteous Rama, the delight of all subjects and, thereby, antagonizing the entire world, how can you claim to be their king?' O great king as for that sensitive Janaki, she stood sighing, stupefied and oblivious (of the past), yet smiling as though her mind was possessed by an evil spirit. That glorious princess Sita who had never experienced any adversity earlier, weeping with sorrow, could not even speak to me anything. When she saw me leaving, she looked at her husband with a dry (pale) face and suddenly burst into tears. Supported by Lakshmana's arms, Rama stood, his face streaming with tears and palms folded, while the wretched Sita, glaring at me and the royal chariot, weeping.       Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Listening to the charioteer, the best of ministers (Sumantra), the king asked him to tell the rest. Having heard him, Sumantra, overcome with tears, related further details of Rama's message. O King the heroes in bark robes and with matted hair crossed the Ganga and proceeded towards Prayaga. Lakshmana walked ahead guarding Rama, the delight of the Raghus. While I returned helplessly seeing them go. When Rama set out for the forest, and I turned back, my horses shedding hot tears were reluctant to walk the path. Thereafter, controlling my grief and paying obeisance to both the princes with folded palms, I ascended the chariot and returned. There along with Guha I waited for (three) days that Rama might call me back. O great king even trees with their flowers, buds and shoots throughout your empire have withered because of the calamity on Rama. Water in rivers, ponds and lakes has heated up while all the foliage in the forests and gardens have shrivelled. No living being move about and even wild animals roam no more. Overwhelmed with grief on account of Rama a great silence pervades the forest. The water in the lotus lakes, O king, has become turbid. The blue lotuses have withered and their shrivelled petals are submerged in water. The fishes and aquatic birds are hidden under waters. Bunches of flowers grown in water and on land, as well as fruits with their scant fragrance do not shine as before. Pleasuregardens are all deserted as the birds have vanished. O best of men, as such they do not look beautiful. None greeted me when I entered Ayodhya, People heaved sighs repeatedly when they did not see Rama. Beholding the royal chariot arrive without Rama, all were on the highway shedding tears of anguish. When the women from mansions, sevenstoried buildings and from royal palaces saw the chariot without Rama, they, overwhelmed with sorrow, cried, 'Alas, Alas'. The women, with their large, bright eyes flooded with gushing tears looked in silence at one another in deep anguish. I did not see any difference in the degree of anguish among friends, those who are not friends and and those who are indifferent. (The degree of agony was same in all). O maharaja, Ayodhya is filled with cheerless people with deep sighs, agonised voices and pale faces depressed and distressed due to Rama's exile. (Even) elephants and horses look spiritless. For me it (the city) resembles (dejected) Kausalya deprived of her son. O maharaja, Ayodhya is filled with cheerless people with deep sighs, agonised voices and pale faces depressed and distressed due to Rama's exile. (Even) elephants and horses look spiritless. For me it (the city) resembles (dejected) Kausalya deprived of her son. At these words of the charioteer, the king in deep distress replied with a voice choked with tears: Incited by Kaikeyi of sinful relations and sinful motive, I did not consult expert, elderly counsellers. For the sake of a woman, this act was committed in great haste, without consulting friends or ministers or men of prudence. Surely it is destiny and this calamity has befallen for the wilful destruction of the (entire) race, O charioteer O Charioteer, if ever I have rendered you any favour, quickly  take me to Rama. My life is hastening me (fast running out). If my command prevails today, Rama may be brought back. Without Rama I cannot live for a moment even. Otherwise if (you think) the mightyarmed (Rama) has gone too far then quickly put me in the chariot, and show me Rama (Carry me to him). Where is that Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana who has wellshaped teeth and wields a mighty bow? If I can see him along with Sita I will survive. If I cannot see Rama of redcoloured eyes, the mightyarmed one and wearing earrings bedecked with precious stones I shall surely go to the abode of Yama, the god of death. What else can be of greater sorrow to me who having reached this state, am still unable to see Rama? Ah Rama, Ah Lakshmana, Ah unfortunate Vaidehi, you do not know that I am dying  like an orphan because of my grief. The king whose mind was extremely enfeebled due to grief and who was immersed in a sea of tears which he was unable to cross continued: O queen Kausalya, I am completely immersed in this ocean of sorrow. The misfortune due to Rama's separation is its breadth. Sita's separation is the other end of the shore. Sighs are its turbulent waves and whirlpools. Tears are its foam and turbid waters. Waving of arms is its fishes. Cries of agony are its roars. My dishevelled hair is its moss. Kaikeyi is the mouth of Badaba. My copious tears are its source. Words of the hunchback (Manthara) are the monstrous crocodiles. The cruel boons to Kaikeyi are its shores. Without Rama I cannot cross  this sea of sorrow alive. Ah, what a pity O queen Kausalya, I am completely immersed in this ocean of sorrow. The misfortune due to Rama's separation is its breadth. Sita's separation is the other end of the shore. Sighs are its turbulent waves and whirlpools. Tears are its foam and turbid waters. Waving of arms is its fishes. Cries of agony are its roars. My dishevelled hair is its moss. Kaikeyi is the mouth of Badaba. My copious tears are its source. Words of the hunchback (Manthara) are the monstrous crocodiles. The cruel boons to Kaikeyi are its shores.

Words of the hunchback (Manthara) are the monstrous crocodiles. The cruel boons to Kaikeyi are its shores. Without Rama I cannot cross  this sea of sorrow alive. Ah, what a pity Though I wish I cannot see Rama together with Lakshmana. Indeed this is very unfortunate. Lamenting thus, king Dasaratha of great reknown fell on the bed, unconscious. Wailing, Dasaratha fell unconscious. He was doubly grieved due to his yearning for Rama. Rama's mother was seized with fear hearing those lamentations.       Thus ends  the fiftyninth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter Kausalya, trembling as if possessed by an evil spirit and rolling on the floor like one who her senses now and again, said to the charioteer (Sumantra): Take me where Rama, Sita and Lakshmana are. I do not wish to live even for a moment without them. 'Turn back your chariot immediately and take me to the Dandaka forest. If I do not follow them, I shall enter the world of Yama'. With folded hands and faltering words choked by his fastflowing tears the charioteer tried to console Kausalya: Abandon your tears, delusion and despair arising out of sorrow. Rama is going to live in the forest, brushing aside all agony. Selfcontrolled Lakshmana, aware of his duty, serves Rama in the forest. By this he is securing his next world. Sita with her mind fixed on Rama is living confidently in that desolate forest without any fear as if it were her home. I could not see even the slightest depression in Sita as if she was accustomed to staying away from home. Earlier, just as Sita used to revel in the gardens of the city, so does she now in those desolate forests. Charming Sita whose face resembles the full Moon, with her mind fixed on Rama, is enjoying even the desolate forest like a child. Her heart is ever united with Rama, and her life is under his control. Without Rama, even Ayodhya would become a forest for her. Seeing villages, cities, trees of different kinds and courses of rivers, Sita is enquiring from Rama or Lakshmana about them. She feels as though she is sporting in the pleasuregarden just a krosa from Ayodhya. Seeing villages, cities, trees of different kinds and courses of rivers, Sita is enquiring from Rama or Lakshmana about them. She feels as though she is sporting in the pleasuregarden just a krosa from Ayodhya. Sita did say something about Kaikeyi, but now I do not remember what. Diverting the context of what he uttered inadvertently relating to Kaikeyi, the charioteer said pleasing words of consolation to Kausalya. Just like the beams of the Moon, Sita's glow is not affected by the fatigue of the journey or by the speed of the wind or by the scorching heat. The countenance of Sita with her gentle eloquence resembles a hundredpetalled lotus. She has the luminance of the full Moon that has not wilted. Her feet, now devoid of lacdye, still look red like lac and shine like the lotus bud. Casting off her ornaments, the damsel (Sita) is gracefully walking as if dalliant with her tinkling anklets for her love for him (Rama). Though in the forest, Sita, under the protection of Rama's arms, is afraid of neither elephants nor lions nor tigers. You need not lament for them or for yourself or for the king. This story of Rama will endure permanently in the world. They are upholding the sacred promise of their father with cheerful hearts, grief given the goby, steadfastly pursuing the path established by maharsis, subsisting on forest fruits and enjoying the forest life. Though Sumantra was speaking with befitting words to prevent Kausalya from weeping over her son which had enfeebled her, she did not stop crying, 'O my beloved', 'O my son', 'O Rama'.       Thus ends the sixtieth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Rama, the greatest among those who please the people, he who was conscious of his duty left for the forest. Kausalya, sobbing in bitter anguish, said to her husband: Your great fame has spread all over the three worlds. People know you as compassionate, generous and sweetspeaking scion of the Raghus. O Dasaratha, the best among kings, how will your two sons and Sita brought up in great comfort now tolerate the hardships of forest life? How can the daughter of Mithila (Sita) who in the prime of her life, accustomed to comforts, endure  heat and cold indeed? How can the largeeyed Sita having enjoyed delicious food mixed with condiments and soup now partake the food prepared with wild grains? How can the blameless Sita, used to the soft sound of songs and musical instruments hear the frightful roars of lions and other carnivorous animals? Where will that mightyarmed and powerful Rama, as lofty as Indra's banner, sleep using his ironbarlike arm as pillow?. When shall I see Rama with his lotushued face, his beautiful locks of hair, breath of lotus fragrance and eyes like blue lotus? No doubt my heart must be made of thunderbolt, since unable to see Rama it does not split into a thousand pieces. (O king) It is because of your heartless action, my Rama and my relatives who deserve to enjoy pleasures at this age have been banished and are miserably wandering in wilderness. Even if Rama returns in the fifteenth year, it is unlikely that Bharata will give up the kingdom and royal treasury (in favour of Rama). Some first feed their own relatives in shraddha ceremony and thereafter look for the best of brahmins to feed. The godlike brahmins who are virtuous and learned will not accept the food after others have partaken even if it is ambrosia. The bulls (best) among the wise brahmins would not like to accept the food after it is tasted by other brahmins, just as bulls dislike their horns being shorn. O Lord of the world why not the eldest and the most distinguished among the brothers likewise disdain the kingdom enjoyed by the younger brother? Just as a tiger will not eat the food acquired by another beast, Rama, the tiger (best) among men will not accept the kingdom enjoyed by others. Havis, sacrificial offerings like ghee, cakes, kusha grass, and sacrificial posts made from khadira wood, once used in the sacrifice cannot be used again. In the same way Rama will not accept this kingdom enjoyed by others like liquour or soma juice drained of its essence. Rama, highly determined will not suffer this indignity. If enraged, he can split open even mount Mandara with his sharp arrows. Out of respect for his father magnanimous Rama is not inclined to kill you. He has not defied the anger, the Sun, the Moon and the sky looking wonderful with stars can be pulled down. He will not even shake or break the earth surrounded by hundreds of mountains. Out of respect for his father magnanimous Rama is not inclined to kill you. He has not defied the anger, the Sun, the Moon and the sky looking wonderful with stars can be pulled down. He will not even shake or break the earth surrounded by hundreds of mountains. A powerful tiger will not allow its tail to be twisted. In the same way Rama also will not tolerate an insult of this sort. Even if all the worlds were to unite and fight against him, he will not fear. This righteous Rama will reestablish justice in this unrighteous world. Valiant and mightyarmed Rama, with his golden shafts can annihilate all living beings and oceans like at the time of  deluge everything is consumed in fire. Such Rama, the best among men, powerful like a lion, with eyes fierce like that of a bull has been destroyed by his own father just as the big fish destroys its own offsprings. You have banished your son who is devoted to righteousness. Is it in accordance with the scriptures and the eternal tradition followed by the twiceborn? O king for a woman the first refuge is the husband, the second her son, the third her relatives and there is no fourth alternative in this world.",
                "Forced to hear the harsh words of angry Kausalya, the king, deeply distressed, was absorbed in sad thought. The king (Dasaratha) tormentor of enemies, for a while, lost his consciousness, his senses bewildered. After a long time he regained his senses. When he regained his senses, the king heaved deep, hot sighs. Seeing Kausalya by his side he relapsed into a state of anxiety. While he was thus reflecting on a sinful act he had inadvertently comitted long ago, the act of discharging an arrow that could hit its target following the sound, flashed in his mind. The great king, the lord with a broken heart started regretting deeply about both the grievous acts he had committed previously (one is shooting at the son of a sage and the other, banishing Rama). Consumed by the double sorrow, the king trembling, with head down and folding his hands said to Kausalya in order to appease her: O Kausalya I entreat you with folded palms. Be merciful. Forever affectionate, you are not cruel even towards your enemies. O Devi for women who have regard for righteousness, a husband, whether virtuous or not, is a god incarnate. You always adhere to righteousness. You have seen both the extremes (good and bad) of this world. Athough you yourself are in grief it does not behove you to speak unpleasant words to one who is suffering from a greater grief. Kausalya heard the pitiable words uttered by the king who was in a wretched condition. She shed tears like a water channel discharging fresh rainwater. Frightened Kausalya, weeping and raising her palms folded like lotus on to her head,  and charged with emotions said with stumbling syllables: O lord, by falling on the ground at your feet, bowing my head I beg of you to be pleased. By your act of beseeching me, I have been badly hurt. I do deserve to be pardoned. O heroic one a woman, who is entreated by her sagacious and praiseworthy husband, loses both the worlds. O righteous one I know the path of dharma. I also know that you are a truthful. Afflicted with grief on account of my son, I spoke somewhat harshly. Grief destroys fortitude. Grief destroys knowledge of the scriptures, grief destroys  everything. There is no enemy equal to grief. One can endure an unexpected blow from the enemy's hand but to endure unexpected  grief, however slight it may be, is impossible. O heroic one even learned ascetics who are well versed in ethics and scriptures and who are free from doubts with regard to dharma and artha, are deluded by grief. This is the fifth night of Rama's exile, but it is like five years to me whose joy has been destroyed by sorrow. As I think of Rama, my heart swells with sorrow just as the ocean rises with rushing rivers. While Kausalya was speaking these hearttouching words, the rays of the Sun began to fade and the night fell.",
                "Waking up in a moment tormented with grief, the king began to ponder once again. Indralike Dasaratha due to banishment of Rama and Lakshmana, was besieged by a great calamity like the Sun enveloped by demonic dark at the time of eclipse. After Rama had left along with his wife the king of Kosala (Dasaratha) recollected his former evil deed and wanted to narrate it to the darkeyed Kausalya. After the banishment of Rama the king spent the sixth night, recalling the evil deed done by him in the past. King Dasaratha distressed by the separation from his son, pondered over his past misdeed, and said to helpless Kausalya, who was equally grieving over the separation from Rama: O gentle auspicious lady a man has to reap the fruit of his action, good or evil. He who, at the commencement of any action, does not foresee the good or evil consequences of his action in considered a child. If some one cuts down mango trees and plants palasa trees and waters them will repent when he sees only flowers while he expects fruit. Without foreseeing the fruits of his action, he who runs after action only will regret at the time of fruition like the one who waters the palasa tree. So I have cut the mango trees and watered palasa trees. In utter foolishness, I have banished Rama at the time of fruition and  regretting later. O Kausalya in my youth I was a great archer who could hit the target by its sound. As such I committed this sin. Just as a boy consumes poison out of delusion, O Devi, this sorrow has befallen me as a result of my own action. Like some one who is deluded by palasa trees I too did not realise the consequences of shooting the target following the direction of the sound. O Kausalya, you were not married then. I was prince regent. The rainy season that inflames passion and pride had just set in. Having sucked the waters of the earth and scorching the world with its rays, the Sun had entered the frightful southern quarter ranged by departed souls. At that time the heat subsided, glistening clouds appeared. The frogs, geese and peacocks began to rejoice. The birds with their plummage moistened  as if they had dipped in water reached with great difficulty the tops of the trees which were shaken by the wind and rain. Engulfed by torrents of rain that continued to fall ceaselessly, the mountain visited by intoxicated antelopes looked like a mass of water. Although pure, the rapidly flowing water from the mountains mixed with the minerals in the soil turned white and red in colour and flowed like a serpent. The streams that were pure, mixed with red soil flowed red, deviating from their natural course. In that highly delightful season, wishing to go hunting I, armed with bow and arrows, rode my chariot towards  river Sarayu. And there, with no control over my senses, I hid  in a lonely place with my bow in readiness intending to shoot a buffalo or an elephant or any other wild animal that might come to the spot for drinking water in the night. Hiding and waiting there, following the sounds of animals I killed two animals that had reached the bank of the river. Then at a place that was out of the range of my sight in darkness I heard the sound of a pitcher being filled with water which resembled the sound of an elephant. Wishing to kill the elephant, I seized my arrow glowing like a venomous snake and aimed it towards the sound. Then I discharged a sharp shaft like a venomous serpent. In the morning twilight I saw that the shaft had hit the vital part of the body of a forest dweller and his cry of 'Alas', was clearly heard as he fell in the water. Then I discharged a sharp shaft like a venomous serpent. In the morning twilight I saw that the shaft had hit the vital part of the body of a forest dweller and his cry of 'Alas', was clearly heard as he fell in the water. When the arrow hit him, a man's voice was heard saying, 'How can an arrow be discharged at a person like me who is an ascetic?' 'I have come to this lonely spot of the river to take water. Who has hit me with this arrow? What (harm) have I done to any one?' 'Renouncing violence I live the life of an ascetic on forest produce. Why should any one kill me with a weapon? 'Who wants to kill me who lives like an ascetic with matted hair and wearing bark or the skin of an antelope? What harm have I done to him? 'Whoever it is, he has committed only a mischievous and senseless act. This sin like a disciple sleeping on the bed of his preceptor none will approve of. 'I do not regret so much about the loss of my own life as  about my mother and father after I am dead. 'So long I have been supporting this aged couple. After I am dead, how will they live? 'My aged parents along with me are killed by a single arrow. Who is that malicious knave  who has slain us? On hearing the piteous voice the bow and arrow dropped from my (trembling) hands since I was keen on following the righteous path. Having heard his pathetic lamentations at night, I was extremely frightened by the force of grief and stood bewildered. With dissipated energy and intensely troubled mind, I reached the bank of river Sarayu and there I saw the ascetic lying struck by the arrow and with scattered locks of hair. The water pitcher was thrown away and his body smeared with blood and dust as he lay on the ground. With dissipated energy and intensely troubled mind, I reached the bank of river Sarayu and there I saw the ascetic lying struck by the arrow and with scattered locks of hair. The water pitcher was thrown away and his body smeared with blood and dust as he lay on the ground. I was mentally stricken and frightened. He looked up as if buring me with the energy of his eyes. Then he uttered the words 'A cruel act' 'O king you have struck me when I was trying to carry water to my parents. I am a forestdweller. What harm have I done to you? 'By striking at the vital part of my body with one arrow, you have killed both my aged and blind mother and father too. 'How will the two who are frail, thirsty and blind wait for me for long controlling their thirst with great difficulty with the expectation (that I would fetch them water)? 'My father does not know that I am lying on the ground. It is true that there is no reward either for asceticism or for scriptural knowledge. 'What can my weak father who has no strength to walk do, even if he knows about it? Like a tree which cannot protect another which is being severed, he is helpless. O scion of the Raghus (Dasaratha) Go at once and inform my father, lest in anger he should burn you like ignited fire consuming the forest. 'O king, this footpath leads to my father's hermitage. Go and beg his forgiveness so that he may not curse you out of anger. 'Gently remove the arrow from my body, O king the sharp arrow is piercing deep into my vital just like the current of the river hits its elevated bank'. The thought of removing the arrow kept me pondering. If not removed, it will be painful, and if removed, he will die. The son of the ascetic noticed my anguish and seeing me thus distressed, wretched and afflicted with sorrow, said: Suffering from excruciating pain, sinking with his limbs twisting and writhing and plunging into death and destruction, with intense agony he uttered the following words with great difficulty: 'I am now calm. I bear my pain with patience. Remove the fear from your mind that you have committed a sin by slaying a brahmin. 'O king Dasaratha, lord of the land, I am not a brahmin. Feel no sense of guilt in your mind. I was born of a sudra mother and a vaisya father.",
                "Grieving for having unfairly killed the great sage the rightenous descendant of the Raghus (Dasaratha) coutinued to tell Kausalya about it: Having committed the sin unwittingly, I was greatly agitated. I reflected in my mind as to how to atone for this great sin. Holding the pot filled with clean water I reached the hermitage following the path as directed. There I found his weak, blind, old parents. With no supporter, they looked like birds with clipped wings. They sat there helplessly like orphans and passively talking about their son, their only hope that I have deprived them of. There I found his weak, blind, old parents. With no supporter, they looked like birds with clipped wings. They sat there helplessly like orphans and passively talking about their son, their only hope that I have deprived them of. Smitten with grief and my heart throbbing with fear I reached the hermitage and my sorrow became manifold. Hearing the sound of my footsteps, the sage said 'O son why have you delayed? Bring me some water quickly'. 'O Dear child, whatever be the reason, you have been sporting in the water so long, come at once to the hermitage. Your mother is anxious. 'O Child, O Son if your mother or I have done anything disagreeable, do not take it to heart, for you are an ascetic. 'You are a support to the supportless, eyes to the blind, you are our very vital life. Why don't you speak to us'? As I saw him, my heart was filled with terror and I stammered as I spoke in garbled sentences. After a lot of effort, with great fear controlling my thoughts and the power of speech, I related to him the calamity that had befallen his son. O magnanimous sage I am a kshatriya known as Dasaratha. I am not your son. A pathetic incident has been caused by my own action, condemnable by the virtuous. Wishing to hunt a wild elephant coming down to the water hole for drinking, I went  to the bank of Sarayu, bow in hand, O revered sage There I heard the sound of a pot being filled with water and mistaking it to be an elephant's, shot an arrow. Thereafter I reached the river bank  and beheld an ascetic with an arrow pierced in his chest. He was lying on the ground, his life ebbing away. O venerable one I released an arrow towards the water aiming at the sound intending to kill an elephant but it hit your son. Then I approached him. He was suffering from excruciating pain. I pulled out at his word the arrow from his chest. Grieving for both of you and crying you are blind he died as soon as the arrow was pulled out. Your son has been killed by me due to my ignorance. Since this has happened, may  the ascetic be pleased to command me on the next course of action. The venerable sage heard my cruel words about the sinful act and was not able to seriously react. (He was stunned). The griefstricken, glorious ascetic with his face filled with tears, heaving deep sighs  broke down with grief and spoke to me as I was standing with folded palms. 'O king, hadn't you yourself broken this inauspicious news, your head would have split into a hundred thousand pieces right now. 'If a kshatriya kills any one knowingly, particularly when in vanaprastha (third stage) this sin can displace even Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt from his position, O king. 'If any one deliberately discharges a weapon upon an ascetic observing austerities or on him who expounds the Vedas, his head will split into seven pieces. 'Since you have done this unwittingly you are still alive. If it had been otherwise, your Ikshvaku race itself would have been exterminated, what to speak of you 'O king take us to that place. We wish to  have the last look at him, at his garment of antelope skin in disarray, his body spattered with blood, lying on the ground unconscious under the sway of the lord of death'. Thus the sage said to me. 'O king take us to that place. We wish to  have the last look at him, at his garment of antelope skin in disarray, his body spattered with blood, lying on the ground unconscious under the sway of the lord of death'. Thus the sage said to me. Thereupon, I took both of them all by myself to that spot and made the grieving ascetics touch the body of their son. Both the ascetics stroking their son's body and collapsed upon it. And the father said: 'O child why are you not greeting us today nor speaking? Why are you lying on the ground? Are you angry with us? 'O righteous son if I am no longer dear to you, (at least) look at your mother. O tender child, why are you not embracing me? Speak. 'From whom shall I hear the sweet recitation of scriptures or other texts, delightful to my heart in the last watch of the night? 'O son I am tortured with sorrow and fear. Who will serve me from now on after the ablution and the morning worship of Sandhya, followed by oblations to the sacrificial fire? 'I am incapable of doing any work, I am unable to procure anything (to meet my needs. now). I have no guide (to help me walk my way). Who will feed me like a welcome guest with tubers and fruits? 'O son how can I support your wretched and pitiable mother, who is blind, old and yearning for her son? 'My dear son, stay with me, do not go (now) to the abode of Yama, (lord of death). Tomorrow accompanied by me and your mother you may 'Deserted by you and without any support in the forest, afflicted with grief and feeling miserable, both of us also will assuredly go to Yama's abode, quickly. 'There seeing Yama, (lord of death), I shall say O Lord of Justice forgive me. Let this boy continue to maintain his parents. 'That lord of justice, who is highly renowned, righteous and the guardian of the worlds will grant me one unfailing boon of protection from fear. 'O sinless son, you are killed by a person of sinful deeds. On this truth, quickly go to those worlds which are attained by those valiant heroes. 'You will attain, my son, the same supreme state achieved by Sagara, Saibya, Dilipa, Janamejaya, Nahusha and Dundumara. 'You, my son, shall attain that supreme state obtained by those who are virtuous, who study the Vedas and practise asceticism.You shall attain the state merited by those bestowers of land as charity, who kindle the sacred fires, who are monoganists, who offer a thousand cows in charity, who nurture the venerable and who willingly lay down their bodies. 'You, my son, shall attain that supreme state obtained by those who are virtuous, who study the Vedas and practise asceticism.You shall attain the state merited by those bestowers of land as charity, who kindle the sacred fires, who are monoganists, who offer a thousand cows in charity, who nurture the venerable and who willingly lay down their bodies. 'He who has killed you will alone attain that undesirable state, a member of our family will not.' In this way the ascetic piteously wailed again and again. Thereafter, he with his wife set about to perform the funeral obsequies of their son. The virtuous son of that ascetic assumed a celestial form through the merit of his good deeds and ascended heaven at once with Indra. The ascetic in the company of Indra consoling the aged couple for a brief moment said: 'I have attained this supreme state by virtue of the service rendered to you. You will also attain my state soon.' The sage's son with his senses under control said this while ascending heaven on a beautiful, celestial, aerial chariot. The radiant ascetic along with his wife hurriedly completed the funeral libations and said to me standing with folded palms: 'Kill me, O king with the same arrow by which you rendered me childless. Death holds no pain for me. 'Though you have killed my purehearted son unintentionally, I will pronounce a disastrous and dreadful curse on you. 'Just as I am now suffering from grief caused by my son's death, you, O king, shall die from the sorrow on account of (separation from) your son. 'Since you, O lord of men, you have killed an ascetic unaware, as kshatriya the sin of slaying a brahmin will not accrue to you immediately. 'Just like the merits of alms come to the giver, you are going to face very soon a dreadful situation causing the end of your life.' Having thus cursed me, the couple piteously lamenting for a long time, laid themselves down on the funeral pyre  and went to heaven. While reflecting about it now, O Devi (Kausalya) I recollect this sin committed by me unintentionally, with childish pranks while practising the art of hitting a target by its sound. Just as a man eating forbidden food and drink falls sick, so have I fallen prey to grief, because of my sin, O Devi O gentle lady, the words of that noble ascetic have come true today. Hence I am now going to give up my life. O Kausalya, I cannot see you with my eyes. Touch me gently, said the frightened Dasaratha, Lord of the earth, to his wife weeping. Whatever I have done to the scion of the Raghu family (Rama) is befitting me, O Devi. And whatever he has done in respect of me is also worthy of him. Which clearsighted man in this world, will abandon his son even if he is of evil conduct? Which son will not get angry with his father when he is banished? Before I die, will Rama touch me once or will he come to me? After reaching the abode of Yama men cannot see their relations. O Kausalya, I am unable to see you. My memory is failing and the messengers of Yama are hastening me. Can there be a greater sorrow than that at the last moment of my life I am unable to see my righteous and truthful son, Rama? My grief in the absence of Rama of peerless deeds is drying up my life as heat dries up small pools of water. Those who will behold Rama's countenance adorned with auspicious earrings on his return in the fifteenth year are gods not men. Blessed are they who will behold Rama's countenance resembling the Moon, lord of the stars with eyes like lotus petals graceful eyebrows, even teeth and a nose. Fortunate indeed are the men who will behold my son's fragrant countenance camparable to the autmnal Moon and the fullblown lotus. Lucky men will behold Rama return to Ayodhya after the completion of his exile, like the planet Venus moving forward on its orbit. O Kausalya, my heart, it appears is sinking and on account of delusion I am not able to feel the sense objects like sound touch and taste together. With the loss of my mental faculty, all the sense organs are giving way, like the rays of the lamp giving way together when the oil is exhausted. This selfcreated grief is rapidly destroying me like the bank of a river eroded by its swift current, leaving me helpless and insensible. Ah, mightyarmed Rama, destroyer of my agonies, Ah, the delight of your father, Ah, my protector, Ah, my son, where have you gone?. Ah, Kausalya, Ah, pitiable Sumitra, Ah, cruel Kaikeyi, my enemy and defiler of my race, I am going to die. King Dasaratha, thus crying in distress in the presence of Rama's mother and  Sumitra reached the end of his life. King Dasaratha, a man of noble vision and lord of men, anguished by the exile of his son, kept pitiably muttering till past midnight  until tormented by an intense agony he breathed his last.       Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then on the following day (unaware of Dasaratha's death) panegyrists uttering benedictions, highly accomplished bards and genealogists proficient in reciting auspicious words, singers versed in musical science reached the palace one after another eulogising the king's glory. Then on the following day (unaware of Dasaratha's death) panegyrists uttering benedictions, highly accomplished bards and genealogists proficient in reciting auspicious words, singers versed in musical science reached the palace one after another eulogising the king's glory. The songs of those who were eulogising the king and uttering benedictions at high pitch pervaded the entire palace. While the bards sang the praise of the king, those who praise clapping their palms  clapped, citing the wonderful deeds of Dasaratha. The birds perched on the branches and some in cages awoke and began to twitter all over the palace. The sacred songs of bards and panegyrists, notes of veena, chantings of metrical hymns and benedictory verses filled the palace. Thereafter, as usual, men observing purificatory practices and skilled in royal service  assembled along with women and eunuchs. The bathattendants brought water mixed with yellow sandal paste in golden vessels at appropriate times in accordance with tradition. Also, a group of women mostly young maidens brought auspicious unguents, articles gratifying the senses and those necessary accessories for completion of bathing process. All the articles brought for the king (for his bath) were presentable and as per tradition. In quality they were excellent and auspicious. All the highly enthusiastic attendants waited for the king till sunrise. Unable to see the king  they doubted about what had happened The women who usually attend to the bed (maids who do the bed in the morning) of Dasaratha (king of Kosala) without any restrictions, approached the king and began waking him up. Conducting themselves agreeably with restraint and obedience,  the women touched the bed of Dasaratha but did not perceive any sign of life. Those women knowledgeable in ascertaining the nature of sleep based on the actions, movements, etc. were apprehensive whether the king was  alive or not. Trembling severely  they seemed like the tips of reeds that  stand against the current. Having seen the king more closely, those women who were apprehensive till then, became certain of the inevitable. Overpowered by grief on account of separation from their sons, Sumitra and Kausalya were fast asleep and did not wake up as if they were possessed by death. Kausalya, with her face dull and pallid, sank down, her limbs contracted. She looked lustreless like stars enveloped in darkness. There lay Sumitra next to Kausalya by the side of the king. Queen Kausalya's face was dull, drooping  down on account of shedding tears of sorrow. Having seen the two auspicious queens asleep, the women in the inner apartment thought the king died in his sleep. Then those women bewailed bitterly and loudly in distress like female elephants in the forest when their leader has fallen out of the herd. Hearing the lamentations of the women suddenly Kausalya and Sumitra woke up from sleep, their senses recovered. Kausalya and Sumitra looked at the king, touched his body, cried aloud, 'Ah, lord' and collapsed on the floor. Kausalya, daughter of the lord of Kosala, lay on the ground writhing in pain, coated  with dust, and devoid of brightness like a star without radiance fallen from the sky. Dasaratha with his body lying still, all the women looked at Kausalya fallen down on the floor like a slain female elephant. Then all the wives of the king led by Kaikeyi,  burning with grief and weeping, lost their senses and fell down. The wailings of the women grew louder and louder until the whole palace reverberated with their lamentations. On the demise of Dasaratha, joy instantly vanished. The palace was thronged with anxious people who were exceedingly bewildered and frightened. The royal family was anguished with distress. The palace was filled all over with the tumult of cries of agony. And it looked miserable with grief. On the demise of Dasaratha, joy instantly vanished. The palace was thronged with anxious people who were exceedingly bewildered and frightened. The royal family was anguished with distress. The palace was filled all over with the tumult of cries of agony. And it looked miserable with grief. Realising that the great and illustrious king, Dasaratha, had passed away, his wives gathered around him, weeping piteously and bitterly and holding one another's hands  bewailed like orphans.       Thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On seeing the king who ascended the heaven just as a blazing fire suddenly extinguishes, or like the ocean emptied of water or the Sun bereft of splendour Kausalya raised the head of the king on to her lap, her eyes filled with tears and body shrunk in sorrow, looked at Kaikeyi and said: On seeing the king who ascended the heaven just as a blazing fire suddenly extinguishes, or like the ocean emptied of water or the Sun bereft of splendour Kausalya raised the head of the king on to her lap, her eyes filled with tears and body shrunk in sorrow, looked at Kaikeyi and said: O cruel one O perverse wretch, O Kaikeyi, your wishes have been fulfilled. You have forsaken the king, that was your only objective. (Now) enjoy the kingdom alone without any obstacles on your way. Rama has gone away leaving me. My lord has ascended the heaven, traversing the wrong road. With my wellwishers gone, I do not want to live. Which woman wishes to live, leaving her godlike husband, except Kaikeyi who has given up her sense of duty? Like a greedy man who eats the (poisonous) kimpaka fruit without realising the defects of the fruit, Kaikeyi has destroyed the Raghu race on account of the hunchback (Manthara). Hearing the unrighteous action ordered by the king in banishing Rama and his wife  king Janaka will suffer great agony like me. That virtuous Rama of lotuspetaleyes has left this place for good, and does not know that I am without a protector, being a widow now. In the same way Sita, daughter of the king of Videha, who does not deserve hardships will be in deep agony. Hearing the ghastly sounds of animals and birds, Sita will surely get frightened and take shelter in Rama. Old and sonless Janaka, constantly thinking of Sita and overpowered with grief will surely give up his life. As his faithful wife, I shall enter the fire by clasping this (Dasaratha's) body and go to  death today itself The servants led away that unfortunate Kausalya who was lamenting in great anguish  embracing the body of Dasaratha. The counsellors, instructed (by Vasistha and others), placed the king's body in an oil tub with the understanding that the funeral rites were to be performed hereafter. The counsellors who were acquainted with all such matters (relating to the king's funeral) were unwilling to perform the obsequies in the absence of any of the king's sons. Meanwhile, they kept watch over the deadbody of the king. On seeing the king's body laid in the oil vat by the counsellors, the women cried  Alas, the king is dead. With tears flowing down their faces, piteously raising their arms, groaning in their burning grief, the women lamented helplessly. When we were already deprived of Rama who was always pleasing and truthful, alas, o great king, why did you leave us? A woman of evil intentions, Kaikeyi, at first separated us from Rama. Now she deprived us of our husband. How can we live with one who is a slayer of her husband? Rama, who was always our and your selfpossessed master and protector has gone to the forest, indeed, abandoning royal wealth. Without you and without the heroic Rama, how can we live overwhelmed with grief and enduring the abuses of Kaikeyi? Why will not Kaikeyi who has abandoned the king, valiant Rama and Lakshmana along with Sita cast aside others? The excellent wives of Dasaratha, overwhelmed with profound grief and tears, are  lying unconcious on the floor. Like night without the Moon, like a woman forsaken by her husband, this city of Ayodhya without that magnanimous king has lost its earlier splendour. With the people of Ayodhya shedding tears, the housewives crying, in anguish, 'alas alas' the courtyards houses and squares of the roads deserted, the city has lost its earlier brilliance. When king Dasaratha ascended to heaven due to grief over his son and when his wives were lying on the ground, the Sun ceased his journey and the night favourable to creatures of darkness suddenly set in. The wellwishers who asembled, unwilling to ignite the funeral pyre of the king in the absence of any one of his sons laid the king's deadbody in that oil trough in an unexpected manner. The city, bereft of illustrious Dasaratha was filled with people sobbing in the courtyards in front of their houses and in the squares in between. That city of Ayodhya bereft of brightness, appeared like the day without the Sun and the night without constellations of stars. After the demise of the king, men and women in the city assembled in groups and denounced the mother of Bharata. Extremely distressed, they had no peace of mind.       Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The night stretched interminably in Ayodhya, which was filled with sobbing people  rendered cheerless by their lamentations. When the night finally ended and after the sunrise next day, the brahmins who perform royal investiture having been called and reached the assembly hall. Markandeya, Maudgalya, Kasyapa, Katyayana, Gautama, Jabali of great renown   accompanied by ministers and brahmins approached Vasistha, the chief  priest of the king and expressed different opinions (on the investiture). Markandeya, Maudgalya, Kasyapa, Katyayana, Gautama, Jabali of great renown   accompanied by ministers and brahmins approached Vasistha, the chief  priest of the king and expressed different opinions (on the investiture). While king Dasaratha died on account of grief over (separation from) his son and rejoined the five elements, the sorrowful night seemed like a hundred years for us. (commented the assembly of ministers). The great king has attained heaven, Rama has taken refuge in the forest and brilliant Lakshmana has also gone with Rama. Bharata and Satrughna, destroyers of enemies, are at the beautiful city of Rajagriha in the Kekaya kingdom, the palace of their maternal grandfather's palace. Therefore, let someone from the race of Ikshvakus be appointed king right now.  since without a king, the country will be destroyed. In a country without a king, thunderous clouds garlanded by lightning would no longer water the earth with celestial showers. Where there is no king, even a handful of seeds will not be sown (will not sprout). In a kingless kingdom, a son or a wife will not obey the father (head of the family). In a kingdom without a king wealth cannot be preserved, no wife would like to stay (with her husband). There is one more cause for a great peril, that is, there is no place for truth in a country (where there is no king). In a country where there is no king, no assemblies are convened by pleasure seeking people, nor do they build delightful gardens or sacred edifices. In a country without a king, selfcontrolled brahmins in charge of sacrificial ceremonies, wellversed in the study of Vedas and strict followers of  austerity will not function. In a country without a king wealthy brahmins, who have performed great sacrifices, do not offer abundance of gifts to the officiating priests. In a country without a king, celebrations of associations promoting the welfare of the country, actors and dancers in large numbers do not prosper. Where there is no king, those engaged in lawsuits will not succeed and those who are accustomed to storytelling will not entertain those who love to listen to stories. In a country without a king, young ladies adorned with golden ornaments no longer meet in the evening at the pleasure garden for sporting. In a country without a king, pleasureseeking men will not drive in the woods on swiftmoving chariots with women. In a country without a king, wealthy people who live on farming and raising cattle cannot sleep safely in their homes with doors wide open. In a country without a king, young elephants of sixty years of age, their tusks adorned with bells no longer wander about on the highways. In a country without a king, the sounds of the ceaseless discharge of arrows and practice of weapons, the clappings of the cord on the skin shield of shooters throwing the arrows are no longer heard. In a country without a king merchants travelling long distances with several kinds of saleable goods cannot go safely on their way. In a country where there is no king, an ascetic who (normally) moves alone, selfcontrolled and contemplating on the higher self no longer wanders or rests in the inn. In a country without a king, there is no security of possessions and the army cannot withstand the  enemy in a battle. In a country without a king, welldressed men are no longer enthusiastic to drive on excellent horses and on chariots. In a country with no king people proficient in scriptures do not withdraw to the forests and (recreational) gardens for debates (on scriptures). In a country where there is no king, people who are disciplined in spiritual practices do not offer garlands of flowers, sweetmeats and alms while worshipping gods. In a country where there is no king, the princes, anointed with sandal paste and agaru, no longer look graceful like blosoming trees in spring time. (The kingdom without a king) is like rivers without water, forests without vegetation and  cows without cowherds. The pennant is an identification for one's chariot. Smoke is a mark of identifying fire. All of us are recognised by the pennant (magnanimity) of the king and such a king has gone to heaven. In a country where there is no king, no one can own anything and, like fish, people devour one another ceaselessly. Atheists, who disregard the bounds of morality and live freely dispelling doubts will tend to follow virtuous path out of fear when subjected to royal punishment. The king is the source for protecting the truth and morality of a country like the eye which perpetually watches the welfare of the body. The king is the protector of truth and righteousness, of men of good families. He is father, and mother. He alone renders welfare of the people. Hence, the king with his excellent conduct surpasses mighty Yama, Vaisravana, Indra and Varuna. If the king did not show the distinction between the good and evil actions, this world would have been enveloped by darkness. Nothing could have been seen. How great (is the king)? Even while the great king was alive, we never defied your word like the ocean which does not overstep its shore. O Vasistha, the best of brahmins, considering all that has happened and knowing that a kingdom without a king is like a forest, you may consecrate a generous son from  the Ikshvaku race as our king.       Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having listened to their (the counsellors') words, Vasistha replied to the host of friends and counsellors of the king  and to all the brahmins: Bharata on whom the kingdom has been conferred is living comfortably in his maternal uncle's house. Let swift messengers go quickly  on speeding horses and bring back the valiant brothers, Bharata and Satrughna. What is there to deliberate for us in this matter? Bharata on whom the kingdom has been conferred is living comfortably in his maternal uncle's house. Let swift messengers go quickly  on speeding horses and bring back the valiant brothers, Bharata and Satrughna. What is there to deliberate for us in this matter? Let the messengers go, said all of them to Vasistha. On hearing this, Vasistha  replied again. Calling Siddhartha, Vijaya, Jayanta, Asoka and Nandana, Vasistha said, All of you  listen to what is required to be done (by you). Go at once from here on swift horses to the city of Rajagrha and concealing signs of grief, convey these words to Bharata as my command: The family priest and all the counsellors  wish your welfare. You must return in haste. There is an urgent task required to be done by you. All of you go there and do not communicate (to Bharata) about the exile of Rama or the demise of his father and the disaster that has befallen the Raghus. Take with you silk garments and precious ornaments for the king of Kekaya and Bharata and depart at once. The messengers set to depart to Kekaya kingdom, carrying with them the necessaries for their journey went to their respective homes mounted on  excellent horses. Having completed the rest of the arrangements for the journey and permitted by  Vasistha, the messengers left. The messengers proceeded in westerly direction for some distance and then crossed the southern end of the Aparatala mountain. Thereafter, they travelled northward along the bank of Malini that flows in between Aparatala and Pralamba mountains. The messengers crossed Ganga at Hastinapura, and went in the westerly direction through the middle of Kurujangala and reached the country of Panchala. Beholding lakes full of water and rivers of pellucid waters there, they travelled fast with a view to fulfilling their mission. The messengers crossed Ganga at Hastinapura, and went in the westerly direction through the middle of Kurujangala and reached the country of Panchala. Beholding lakes full of water and rivers of pellucid waters there, they travelled fast with a view to fulfilling their mission. The messengers crossed the divine Saradanda of calm waters frequented by fowls of various speices and thronged with people. And proceeded speedily. They reached a divine tree (of great powers) known as Satyopayachana tree and having gone round and paid homage they entered the Kulinga city. From there they reached a village known as Abhikala and crossed the sacred Ikshumati flowing from Bodhibhavana mountain. This region was enjoyed by fathers and forefathers of Dasaratha. There they saw the brahmins versed in the Vedas and drank water with cupped  palms. Then they continued their journey through the middle of Bahlika country, and  reached Sudama mountain. Beholding the footprints of Visnu (on Sudama mountain), and seeing Vipasa, and Salmali rivers, trees, streams, deep wells, ponds, pools, large tanks, different kinds of lions, tigers and elephants, they travelled a long distance with the intention of fulfilling the command of their master.

After a prolonged journey the messengers with their tired horses soon reached Girivraja, the (capital city of Kekaya kingdom) best of cities. To please their master (sage Vasistha)  and to preserve the royal dynasty and also to protect the honour of the (race and people), the messengers soon reached their destination by night without any negligence of their duty.       Thus ends  the sixtyeighth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On the very night the messengers were entering the city, Bharata had a distressing dream. The son of the king of kings (Bharata) felt extremely troubled hen he had an  unpleasant dream at dawn. Observing him griefstricken his peers who always spoke pleasant words, engaged him in a variety of ways in the assembly in order to divert him. In order to provide mental peace to Bharata, some played stringed instruments while some enacted dramatic scenes, some danced and cracked various kinds of jokes. The magnanimous Bharata born in the race of Raghus, was not delighted by the conversations and jokes and soothing words of his friends. Addressing Bharata amidst his companions some one close among them said O friend why are you dejected in spite of being in the company of friends. Addressing his companion who was speaking thus, Bharata replied, saying Listen to the reason this desolation has overtaken me: In my dream I saw my father looking pale, with dishevelled hair, his body filled with filth falling from the peak of a mountain into a pool of cow  dung. I saw my father floating in that pool of cow  dung, drinking oil with cupped palms and  bursting into laughter again and again. Thereafter I beheld him eating rice cooked with sesame seeds, his body besmeared with oil plunging again and again into it (the pool). In that dream I beheld the sea being dried up and the Moon fallen onto the ground. I saw the earth as though enveloped by darkness and obscured, the tusk of an  elephant worthy of a ride by the monarch broken into pieces, a blazing fire  extinguished suddenly, the earth split open, various trees dried up and mountains crumbled and covered with smoke. In that dream I beheld the sea being dried up and the Moon fallen onto the ground. I saw the earth as though enveloped by darkness and obscured, the tusk of an  elephant worthy of a ride by the monarch broken into pieces, a blazing fire  extinguished suddenly, the earth split open, various trees dried up and mountains crumbled and covered with smoke. In that dream I beheld the sea being dried up and the Moon fallen onto the ground. I saw the earth as though enveloped by darkness and obscured, the tusk of an  elephant worthy of a ride by the monarch broken into pieces, a blazing fire  extinguished suddenly, the earth split open, various trees dried up and mountains crumbled and covered with smoke. In the dream, I beheld my father clad in black clothes and resting on a seat made of iron and the women in dark and brownish complexion laughing at him. Thereafter, I beheld that virtuous monarch bedecked with garlands made of red flowers and his body bedaubed with red sandalpaste, hurrying off southward on a chariot yoked with asses. Finally I beheld a demoness attired in red clothes with an ugly appearance, dragging the king away as if mocking at him. I had such a frightful dream last night. Either I, Rama, the king or Lakshmana might  die. If one beholds in a dream a person setting out on a carriage yoked to asses, the wreath of smoke ascending from his funeral pyre will be seen soon. So it is for this reason that I am desolate and cannot respond well to your conversation. It appears as if my throat is getting parched up and my mind is illdisposed. I do not see any reason for apprehension but I experience only fear. My voice has degenerated. My appearance looks haggard. Without any reason whatsoever I detest myself. On observing the course of this nightmare, with all those images formerly unconceived and having thought of the king's incomprehensible presence, a great fear that has gripped my heart does not leave me.       Thus ends the sixtyninth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki",
                "While Bharata was relating his dream, the mounted messengers (from Ayodhya) with their weary horses entered the lovely city of Rajagriha  surrounded by an impassable moat. There they met the king of Kekaya country and his son, Yuddhajit and were received with honour. Touching the feet of the king with reverence, they  said to Bharata: While Bharata was relating his dream, the mounted messengers (from Ayodhya) with their weary horses entered the lovely city of Rajagriha  surrounded by an impassable moat. There they met the king of Kekaya country and his son, Yuddhajit and were received with honour. Touching the feet of the king with reverence, they  said to Bharata: The family priest (Vasistha) and all the counsellors have enquired about your welfare. You must return immediately. There is an urgent matter to be attended by you. Oh largeeyed one (Bharata) you are asked to take these excellent raiments and precious ornaments and bestow them on your maternal uncle (said the messengers). O prince these gifts worth twenty crore are intended for the king and the rest of the gifts worth ten crore for your maternal uncle. Affectionate towards his relatives and friends, Bharata received all those gifts and in return honoured those messengers with things they liked, asking them: I hope my father, Dasaratha is doing well and revered Rama and Lakshmana are in good health (I hope) Kausalya mother of the sagacious Rama the venerable lady devoted to righteousness one who knows the ways of righteousness and observes the prescribed code of conduct, is keeping sound  health. I hope my mother Sumitra (the middle one) who is familiar with the ways of righteousness, the mother of valiant Lakshmana and Satrughna, is enjoying good health. And what about my mother Kaikeyi, ever intent on her own wellbeing, wrathful, irascible and proud of her intelligence? Is she maintaining sound health? Having listened to the words of that magnanimous Bharata, those messengers addressed him  gracefully with these words. O tiger among men (Bharata) those of whose welfare you are enquiring are all doing well. May the goddess of wealth and prosperity await you and let your chariot be yoked. Having thus been addressed, Bharata said to the messengers. Let me seek the permission of the great king of Kekaya to leave and say goodbye, informing him that the messengers are hastening me up. Having addressed the messengers who were pressing him to leave (for Ayodhya) Bharata said to his maternal grandfather: O king, urged by these messengers I wish to go to my father. I shall come back again (from Ayodhya) whenever you  remember me. Then the  king of Kekaya, the maternal grandfather of Bharata, having heard the words of the scion of the Raghu dynasty (Bharata), kissed him on his forehead and spoke these auspicious words: You may go, my child I permit you to leave. Kaikeyi has a worthy son in you. O slayer of enemies convey my best wishes to your mother and father. My child, convey my best wishes, too, to your family priest Vasistha and other illustrious brahmins and also to those two great bowmen (Rama and Lakshmana). The king of Kekaya felicitated Bharata, out of affection and bestowed on him wellbred elephants, manycoloured blankets, antelope skins and riches. King of Kekaya generously gave to the son of Kaikeyi (Bharata) in his honour two thousand gold coins and  sixteen hundred horses. Similarly his maternal uncle Ashwapati quickly presented him amenable, trustworthy and virtuous counsellors as companions on his return journey. His maternal uncle gave him the wealth of goodlooking elephants born in Iravata and Indrasira mountains and swiftmoving and welltrained asses which can be yoked easily. He gave riches too. He also gave him a gift of wellraised dogs of the inner apartment hugebodied with the strength and courage of tigers who used their fangs as weapons. All the wealth given by the king of Kekaya did not delight Bharata, son of Kaikeyi who was in a hurry to depart for Ayodhya. Then his heart was filled with extreme anxiety due to the haste of the messengers to depart and also due to the dream he had. Prosperous Bharata on leaving his residence, passed through incomparable royal highway thronged with men, elephants and horses. Then the nobleminded, prosperous Bharata, on leaving the  highway, saw  the inner apartment of the king which he entered unhindered. Thus having taken leave of his maternal grandfather and uncle Yuddhajit, Bharata accompanied by Satrughna boarded the chariot and went along. And the servants harnessing more than a hundred chariots of wellrounded wheels and also camels, oxen and horses followed Bharata who started off. Under the protection of the army, the illustrious Bharata who was devoid of enemies, accompanied by ministers who were comparable to him and Satrughna, departed from his venerable grandfather's house like a siddha leaving the regions of Indra.       Thus ends the seventieth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                " Glorious and prosperous prince Bharata, the delight of the Ikshvaku race, set out from Rajagriha, took the eastern direction, and observing the course of the river Sudama crossed Hladini and Satadru rivers which were very wide and flowing westwards crested with waves.  Glorious and prosperous prince Bharata, the delight of the Ikshvaku race, set out from Rajagriha, took the eastern direction, and observing the course of the river Sudama crossed Hladini and Satadru rivers which were very wide and flowing westwards crested with waves.  Bharata, ever true to his word, handsome and purehearted, reached Aparaparpata region and crossed river Satadru at Eladhana, the mountain in which river Silavaha originates. Then he traversed Salyakarsna regions in the northeast, observing the course of the Silavaha and went beyond the great mountains in the direction of the forest called Chaitraratha.  Bharata, ever true to his word, handsome and purehearted, reached Aparaparpata region and crossed river Satadru at Eladhana, the mountain in which river Silavaha originates. Then he traversed Salyakarsna regions in the northeast, observing the course of the Silavaha and went beyond the great mountains in the direction of the forest called Chaitraratha.  Arriving at the confluence of Saraswati and Ganga and traversing the north of Veeramatsya region, he entered the Bharunda forest.  He crossed the swiftflowing river known as Kulinga surrounded by hills and pleasing to the mind. Thereafter on crossing Yamuna he made his army rest on the otherside.  The weary horses rested and cooled their bodies. And they bathed and drank. They set out again refreshed taking with them a store of water.  Then with the blessed prince (Bharata) on an excellent chariot, it (the army) moved through the vast and uninhabited forest like the god of wind passing through the sky.  Bharata, the descendant of Raghu, knowing that the mighty river Bhagirathi was difficult to cross at a place known as Anshudhana, quickly reached the famous city of Pragvata.  With Ganga at Pragvata city and river Kutikoshtika crossed along with his army, he reached Dharmavardhana village.  Having traversed the southern end of Torana, the son of Dasaratha (Bharata) reached the beautiful Varutha village via Jambuprastha.  He (Bharata) halted in that charming forest for a while, proceeded eastwards till he reached a place known as Ujjihana garden abounding in spriyaka trees.  After reaching the groves of sala and priyaka trees, Bharata harnessed the swiftrunning horses to the chariot and ordered his forces to proceed fast.  That tiger among men, Bharata halted at a place known as Sarvatirtha and crossed the Uttanika and various other rivers with the help of hillborn horses. He crossed the Kutika river on an elephant the river Kapivati at a place known as Lauhitya.  That tiger among men, Bharata halted at a place known as Sarvatirtha and crossed the Uttanika and various other rivers with the help of hillborn horses. He crossed the Kutika river on an elephant the river Kapivati at a place known as Lauhitya.  Bharata crossed the rivers Sthanumati at Ekasala and Gomati at Vinata villages. Thereafter as his horses were extremely tired he rested for a while in the sala forest in Kalinganagara before he speedily set out (again).  He passed quickly through the forest at night and at sunrise beheld the city of Ayodhya built by king Manu.  Having spent seven nights on his way, that tiger among men (Bharata) saw Ayodhaya before him. He said to the charioteer:  O charioteer I am able to see Ayodhya of great renown from a distance but not so clearly that whiteclaycity of Ayodhya, with its sacred gardens ruled by several rajarsis, inhabited by numerous wealthy people, by virtuous brahmins and priests who perform sacrifices and who are wellversed in the Vedas.  O charioteer I am able to see Ayodhya of great renown from a distance but not so clearly that whiteclaycity of Ayodhya, with its sacred gardens ruled by several rajarsis, inhabited by numerous wealthy people, by virtuous brahmins and priests who perform sacrifices and who are wellversed in the Vedas.  I do not hear now, in Ayodhya the tumultous noise of men and women I used to hear earlier all over.  I do not see people who with passion used to stroll in the parks early in the morning. I see no cheerfulness in any one.  O charioteer, people full of passion have abandoned the gardens. To me, the city looks like a forest as if weeping.  Important people mounted on elephants or horses are not seen going out of the city or coming in.  Earlier the gardens used to reverberate with passionate songs of birds--places appropriate for lovers seeking pleasures.  Now the trees appear cheerless, the paths are full of dry leaves fallen all over. It appears as if the trees are crying.  I do not hear in the red tincture of the rising Sun the melodious voices of the freely moving animals and birds.  Why is it that the incomparable fragrance of sandal and incense that used to fill the nostrils, not blowing now in the prosperous city of Ayodhya?  Why is it that the sounds of musical instruments like mrudangas and veenas are not heard now? Why is the city filled with melancholy?  Since I see many passing, inauspicious, sinful, ugly sights, my mind shrinks.  I do not see anywhere, O charioteer the wellbeing, of my kinsmen. Hence I feel deluded and my heart is filled with grief.  Dejected and depressed at heart, with no control over his senses and his mind full of apprehension, Bharata swiftly entered the city of Ayodhya ruled by the Ikshvakus.  He entered the city through the gate known as Vaijayanta with his horses exhausted. The doorkeepers stood up and amidst cries of victory followed him in.  Bewildered, that descendant of Raghu (Bharata), reciprocated the greetings of the gatekeepers and then addressed the exhausted charioteer, Ashwapati:  O irreproachable one, why was I brought here in haste without any reason? My mind apprehends something inauspicious. I feel indisposed.  O charioteer I now see the very for ebodings I had heard in the past in connection with the death of kings.  I see the unswept homes of householders standing dirty with doors not closed. There is no beauty anywhere. No one offers oblations (at the time of worship). There is no fragrance of burning incense. The families have no food to eat. The people look cheerless. I see inauspiciousness everywhere.  I see the unswept homes of householders standing dirty with doors not closed. There is no beauty anywhere. No one offers oblations (at the time of worship). There is no fragrance of burning incense. The families have no food to eat. The people look cheerless. I see inauspiciousness everywhere.  I see the unswept homes of householders standing dirty with doors not closed. There is no beauty anywhere. No one offers oblations (at the time of worship). There is no fragrance of burning incense. The families have no food to eat. The people look cheerless. I see inauspiciousness everywhere.  The temples stand devoid of the beauty of floral offerings. The floors of front yards are left unswept and unsmeared. They look deserted, devoid of brightness of the past.  The offerings to deities have been dispensed with. There are no groups of people performing the usual holy sacrifices. The markets where garlands were sold now stand without them.  Even traders seem restrained by the loss of business. They are not seen as before concentrating on their trade.  I see groups of birds frequenting the temples. The sanctuaries appear dispirited. The people in the city, both men and women look dull, emaciated, pitiable with throats choked. Their eyes are filled with tears and minds absorbed in distressing thoughts.  I see groups of birds frequenting the temples. The sanctuaries appear dispirited. The people in the city, both men and women look dull, emaciated, pitiable with throats choked. Their eyes are filled with tears and minds absorbed in distressing thoughts.  With these words said to the charioteer, Bharata, having seen such ominous sights in Ayodhya, proceeded to the king's palace with a depressed heart.  As he (Bharata) beheld the city of Ayodhya that once had the lustre of the city of Indra, now with its crossroads, houses and highways all deserted, the fittings (nuts and bolts) on the doors red with dust, he was overwhelmed with grief.",
                "Not finding his father in his abode, Bharata went to see his mother in her apartment. On seeing her son, who was sent away, presently arriving, the delighted Kaikeyi sprang up from her golden seat. On entering home the righteous Bharata found it devoid of cheer and touched the auspicious feet of his mother (with reverence). Kaikeyi, gave her illustrious son Bharata a hug, kissed him on his forehead, made him rest on her lap and began her query. How many nights have you spent (on the way) since you left your noble grandfather's residence? Hasn't the hurried journey (over such a long distance) on the chariot left you exhausted?  My son are your revered grandfather and your maternal uncle Yudhajit doing well? Did you have a pleasant time during the sojourn? You should tell me all this. Thus asked lovingly by his mother Kaikeyi, the lotuseyed Bharata, the king's delight  narrated everything to her. This is the seventh night since I left my noble grandsire's residence. My mother's father, king of Kekaya and my maternal uncle Yudhajit are doing well. The (horses carrying) the wealth including the gems which the king (of Kekaya), the subduer of enemies had bestowed on me were exhausted on the way. Therefore I have come in advance. Urged upon by the messengers carrying out the orders of the king, I have come. You, O mother, should answer the questions. I wish to ask you. Your goldbedecked couch, worthy of resting lies empty. None of the attendants of the Ikshvakus look cheerful.  I had come here with the hope to see king Dasaratha who spends most of his time in my mother's residence. But today I do not see him . I would like to pay obeisance at my father's feet. Will you answer my question, O mother, and tell me regarding his whereabouts? Or perchance could he be at the residence of my eldest mother Kausalya? In spite of knowing everything, Kaikeyi actuated by greed for the kingdom, broke the unpleasant and dreadful news as if it were pleasing to Bharata, who was ignorant of what had transpired.  Your highsouled, brilliant father ever engaged in performing sacrifices and a refuge for the virtuous people, went the inevitable way every living being must follow (attained heaven). On hearing these words, he (Bharata), born of a righteous race and endowed with purity of character was shattered by the immense grief of his father's demise and dropped down instantaneously on the floor. The mightyarmed, valiant Bharata, uttering pitiable words, evoking compassion. Alas, I am finished fell down at once throwing up his arms. Overwhelmed with grief, radiant Bharata reeling with delusion due to sorrow, lamented over the death of his father. This couch of my father once used to shine like the spotless night sky irradiated by the autumnal Moon. But today this couch without my sagacious father no longer shines like the sky without the Moon or like the sea evaporated.  Bharata, the foremost among the victorious, clearing his tearchoked throat and covering his auspicious countenance with raiment, wept in profound distress with tears overflowing. Anguished and griefstricken, he who resembled the gods, fell down on the ground like a trunk of the sala tree in the forest severed by an axe. Seeing her son who was like a mighty elephant or like the Sun or the Moon, Kaikeyi lifted him up from the ground and spoke these words: Anguished and griefstricken, he who resembled the gods, fell down on the ground like a trunk of the sala tree in the forest severed by an axe. Seeing her son who was like a mighty elephant or like the Sun or the Moon, Kaikeyi lifted him up from the ground and spoke these words: O illustrious prince arise, arise. Why are you lying down on the floor? Learned people like you, who are worthy of honour in the assembly ought not to grieve like this.  O highly intelligent one, by your wisdom, virtuous conduct and scriptural knowledge you are entitled to dispense charity and perform sacrifices. You will always shine incessantly like light of the Sun. Bharata engulfed in profuse sorrow wept for a long time rolling on the ground and then said these words in reply to his mother: Thinking that the king is about to consecrate Rama or perform some sacrifice, I undertook the journey in great delight. Now everything has turned out to be different. My mind is shattered.I no longer behold my father who is ever intent on my welfare and happiness. O mother what ailment caused the king's death before I could return? How fortunate are Rama and others by whom the last rites of my father were performed  Surely the illustrious maharaja is not aware of my arrival. Otherwise he would have quickly bent my head and kissed me on my forehead.  Where is that hand of my father of unwearied actions, the hand that would wipe away the dust from my person with a pleasant touch? Announce at once my arrival to the wise Rama, the man of unwearied actions, my brother, father and friend whose slave I am.  To one who knows the ways of righteousness the elder brother is (like) the father. Indeed, he (Rama) is my refuge and I shall hold his feet now.  What did my father, the noble king, conversant with righteous conduct, true, to his vows, one who always conducted himself in a righteous manner, whose truth was his prowess (at the time of his death)? I want to hear the exact words of my father's last message to me. Thus questioned (by Bharata), Kaikeyi related the exact facts: The magnanimous king, the foremost of those who attained the excellent state after, death, went to the other world, lamenting 'O Rama, O Sita, O Lakshamana'. Your father, caught by the noose of death, like a great elephant bound by cords, uttered these last words: 'Those men who will see Rama returning home along with Sita and mightyarmed Lakshmana, will have their desires fulfilled.' Bharata was more distraught on hearing the words that conveyed the second unpleasant tidings. With downcast countenance, he again enquired of his mother thus:  Where has righteous Rama who enhances the delight of Kausalya along with his brother Lakshmana and Sita gone now? Thus questioned, his mother started relating the exact events, presuming them to be pleasant tidings (for Bharata). O my son, prince Rama attired in garments of bark along with Sita and followed by Lakshmana left for the great Dandaka forest. Conscious of the glory of his race, Bharata continued to enquire if there was any unrighteous conduct on the part of his brother. I hope Rama did not seize the wealth of any brahmin nor did any harm to an innocent person, whether rich or poor. I hope he did not covet another man's wife. Like a sinner who had slain a child in embryo why has he been banished to Dandaka forest?  Then the capricious mother, with the same feminine disposition which she had displayed earlier, started giving a faithful account of all her deeds. On hearing the words of great Bharata, that foolish woman Kaikeyi thinking herself to be wise, cheerfully said: Rama did not rob any brahmin of even a little wealth nor did he harm any innocent man, whether rich or poor. He never casts his eyes on another's wife. My son, I on hearing of Rama's consecration asked your father to confer the kingdom on you and banish Rama. Your father, faithful to his word, banished Rama along with Lakshmana and Sita. The renowned ruler of the earth (king Dasaratha), unable to behold (the sorry state of) his beloved son and stricken by filial grief, merged into the five elements (died). O knower of dharma, assume kingship now. It is only for your sake that all this has been done by me.  My son, give up sorrow and agony and take recourse to courage. This city as well as the kingdom, free from all obstacles, is under your control.",
                "On hearing about the demise of the father and his two brothers sent in exile, Bharata  overtaken by sorrow spoke thus: Bereft of my father and my brother who was like a father to me, of what avail is this kingdom to me when I am grieving and fallen into misfortunes? You have caused the death of the king and reduced Rama to an ascetic. You have piled one sorrow over sorrow on me like rubbing salt to the wound You have come here for the destruction of this race, like a fatal night. My father did not realize that he was embracing a live charcoal. O woman of sinful thoughts, you have brought about the death of my father. O obloquy of the race, by your folly you have deprived this family of its happiness. My father king Dasaratha who is bound to truth and highly renowned, having come under your influence and tormented by intense grief has departed from this world. Why was my father the righteous maharaja killed? Why was Rama exiled into the forest? Tormented by the grief of separation from their sons, it is difficult for Kausalya and Sumitra to survive under you, O my mother. My noble and righteous brother (Rama), who is well aware of his duties to the elders conducted himself before you as he would before his own mother. In the same way my eldest mother the farsighted Kausalya, too adhered to righteousness and conducted herself towards you like a sister. You have forced Kausalya's son, so pure in mind, to wear garments made of bark and dwell in the forest. Do you not feel remorse for it, O perverse wretch? The glorious, valiant, selfpossessed (Rama) had never contemplated evil. What possible reason do you have for sending him, clothed in bark, into exile?  Being avaricious, you are, I think, unaware of my devotion to Rama. This great calamity has been brought about by you for (your greed for) the kingdom. When Rama and Lakshmana, the best of men stay away from me, by virtue of what mighty power am I competent to protect this kingdom? The mighty and righteous maharaja used to rely upon the powerful Rama just as mount Meru depends on the forest surrounding it for its protection. Like a young untrained bullock that cannot carry the weight fit for a great bull, with what strength can I bear this burden? If I gather the strength (to carry the burden) either by employing the four expedients (available to a king against an enemy) or by the power of intellect, I will not allow you, covetous of your son, to fulfil your ambition. Had Rama not treated you as his own mother I would not have the slightest hesitation to renounce you, a lady of sinful disposition. O woman of sinful thoughts fallen from virtuous conduct, how did you entertain this thought reproachable to our ancestors? In our race only the eldest son is installed in the kingdom and the other brothers behave with utmost respect towards him. O cruel one I suppose neither have you any respect for the royal tradition nor are you aware of the everlasting benefit that ensues in following the royal traditon.  According to the established law of royalty, the eldest son is invariably crowned in the kingdom. This is true of all kings. This is a special tradition of the kings of the Ikshvaku race. As for the Ikshvaku kings, righteousness is their sole protection. They follow the ancestral traditions befitting the noble race. This tradition has been topsyturvied by admitting you into the family. Even the kings in your ancestral family were highly distinguished men. How did this condemnable deflection originate in your mind? O woman of sinful disposition, I on my part will not fulfil your cherished desire. You have started a distressing deed to bring an end to my existence. To cause a great discomfiture for you, right now I shall bring back my faultless brother, the beloved of his people, from the forest. With the effulgent Rama brought back, I shall serve him with a  steadfast mind. Having inflicted on his mother these unpleasant words in this manner, the highsouled Bharata, overwhelmed with grief, roared again like a lion in a mountaincave.       Thus ends the seventythird sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Overtaken by great wrath, Bharata reproached his mother and then said to her again: O cruel Kaikeyi of wicked conduct, you may be deprived of the kingdom. Abandoned by righteousness, you shall be weeping for me after my death. Death for the king and exile for Rama, similar fate for both, have befallen on your account. What possible harm, either the king or the highly virtuous Rama has done to you? O Kaikeyi by destroying this race you have earned the demerit of killing an embryo and shall enter hell. You shall never attain the same state of living, in the  afterworld of your husband. That by doing this horrible deed you have committed a great sin of renouncing Rama, the beloved of all worlds. Therefore I am overtaken by fear. You have caused my father's death and Rama's exile. As for me, I have obtained ignominy in this world. O cruel woman, O woman of vicious character you are an enemy assuming a mother's form, lustful for kingdom. You are a murderess (of your husband) and I shall never speak to you. As you have vitiated the race, my mothers Kausalya and Sumitra are overwhelmed with great sorrow.  As you sent virtuous Rama, ever devoted to truth, into the forest, my father died out of grief (due to separation from his son). Therefore, you are not the true daughter of the righteous and sagacious king Aswapati but a demoness born there to destroy your father's race.  As you sent virtuous Rama, ever devoted to truth, into the forest, my father died out of grief (due to separation from his son). Therefore, you are not the true daughter of the righteous and sagacious king Aswapati but a demoness born there to destroy your father's race. The sin you have committed with a particular objective has affected me and (as a result) I am left without my father. I am abandoned by my brothers. I am hated by every one in this entire world. O woman of sinful convictions you will go to hell. You have separated righteous Kausalya from her son. For having committed such a sin, what afterworld awaits you  (is not known)? O cruel one why do you not realise that Rama, born of Kausalya, is the eldest son and equal to my father? He is selfrestrained and a refuge to his kith and kin. A son born from every limb, big or small, and from the heart is the most beloved of all for his mother while the other relatives are only loving ones. It is said that once upon a time Surabhi, the divine cow, highly respected by the gods and conversant with righteous ways, beheld her two sons who fainted due to fatigue while carrying the burden of the ploughs. On seeing her two sons lying on earth exhausted, she wailed in distress for them with her eyes filled with tears. The fine drops of her fragnant tears trickled down the body of the great king of the gods (Indra).  When Indra, lord of the gods, saw those tears of holy fragrance fallen on his body he understood that the tears were shed by the venerated Kamadhenu. While looking around Indra beheld Kamadhenu in intense pain stationed in the sky,   looking distressed and miserable, and wailing. The king of the gods, Indra, wielder of thunderbolt, saw the renowned Kamadhenu consumed with grief. Alarmed, he said to her with palms joined in reverence: 'O holy cow fear not. You wish the welfare of all, Has any great calamity befallen us from any quarter? I hope not. What is the reason for your sorrow? Tell me'.  On hearing the sagacious Indra, king of the gods, Kamadhenu, proficient in speech, calmly replied: 'God forbid, O Indra, lord of the Immortals no calamity has befallen you from any quarter. Only I am in trouble. I am weeping for these pair of bulls, my own sons who are in difficulty. When I see them scorched by the rays of the Sun, miserable, emaciated and weeping, beaten by a ploughman, I am immersed in grief'. 'God forbid, O Indra, lord of the Immortals no calamity has befallen you from any quarter. Only I am in trouble. I am weeping for these pair of bulls, my own sons who are in difficulty. When I see them scorched by the rays of the Sun, miserable, emaciated and weeping, beaten by a ploughman, I am immersed in grief'. 'These bulls were born from my body and they are oppressed by the burden. Having seen their anguish, I am extremely grieved. There is none so dear as a son'. The wishfulfilling cow (Kamadhenu) had innumerable sons spread all over the world. When Indra saw that Kamadhenu too was weeping for her sons, he concluded 'there is no one greater than a son'.  Wishing always to nourish the worlds Kamadhenu conducts herself with an unequalled character. In accordance with her nature, she has imbibed in herself eminent virtues. She is endowed with all prosperity. In spite of her thousand sons, she is weeping thus for her two bulls, what can one say of Kausalya separated from her only son Will she be her normal self again?'  Wishing always to nourish the worlds Kamadhenu conducts herself with an unequalled character. In accordance with her nature, she has imbibed in herself eminent virtues. She is endowed with all prosperity. In spite of her thousand sons, she is weeping thus for her two bulls, what can one say of Kausalya separated from her only son Will she be her normal self again?' This pious lady is blessed with only one son and (now) has been rendered childless by you. Therefore, you shall experience grief in this world and hereafter. As for me, I shall do whatever is necessary for the atonement of the improper conduct shown towards my father and brother and for enhancement of my fame. There is no doubt  about it.  If I fail to bring back the mighty son of Kausalya, I shall enter the forest frequented by ascetics. O vicious one, O evilintentioned one being watched by the citizens with their throats choked with tears of grief, I cannot endure the burden of the sin committed by you. Jump into the fire or go to Dandaka forest or hang yourself. There is no other recourse for you. When Rama who has truth as his prowess accepts the kingdom, I shall have accomplished my purpose at last and I shall be free from all blemishes. In this way like an elephant driven by prods and goads in the forest, highly enraged Bharata hissing like a serpent dropped down on the ground. Prince Bharata, the scorcher of enemies, with bloodshot eyes, raiment in disarray, ornaments tossed about lay fallen on the ground like the banner of Indra (husband of Sachi) at the close of the festival of flaghoisting.       Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On regaining his senses after a long time, the valiant Bharata looked at his unfortunate mother whose eyes were filled with tears, and condemned her amidst the counsellors. Neither did I ever desire the kingdom nor did I ever consult my mother in this regard and I am not even aware of the consecration that was planned by the king for I was away in a distant country with Satrughna. Neither did I ever desire the kingdom nor did I ever consult my mother in this regard and I am not even aware of the consecration that was planned by the king for I was away in a distant country with Satrughna. I knew nothing of the banishment of great Rama nor did I know how Lakshmana or Sita had gone on exile. As magnanimous Bharata was wailing, Kausalya recognised his voice and said to Sumitra: Bharata, the farsighted son of Kaikeyi of cruel deeds has come and I wish to see him. Having said so to Sumitra, Kausalya trembling and almost lifeless, emaciated, sullied and turned pallid set out for the place where Bharat was. But at the same time Bharata, the younger brother of Rama accompanied by Satrughna  proceeded to the place where Kausalya resided. Then agonised Bharata and Satrughna, beholding that venerable, noblehearted, griefstricken, weeping Kausalya who was  almost semiconscious overcome with grief, approached her with great sorrow and hugged her. Looking at Bharata, the deeply afflicted Kausalya said, The kingdom which you had desired has been acquired without any obstacle. Alas Kaikeyi had quickly secured it for you  through her crooked act. Looking at Bharata, the deeply afflicted Kausalya said, The kingdom which you had desired has been acquired without any obstacle. Alas Kaikeyi had quickly secured it for you  through her crooked act. What advantage did cruel Kaikeyi visualize in sending away my son to dwell in the forest  wearing robes of bark? Kaikeyi should send me also without any delay to that place where my illustrious Rama with golden navel dwells. Or else I, accompanied by Sumitra, shall go happily on my own holding the sacred fire in front to that place where Rama dwells. Or, you should now take me personally to that place where, my son Rama, the best among men, is performing austerities. This vast kingdom, with all its abundance of wealth and grain, elephants, horses and chariots has been delivered to you by her. Thus reproached by many a harsh word, like needle pricking a wound, the sinless Bharata was intensely pained. (Having heard these words), his senses reeling, he became unconscious, lamented profusaly and fell at her feet. And on regaining his senses, he stood motionless. As Kausalya was lamenting in this manner, overwhelmed with deep grief, Bharata, his palms joined in reverence, replied her in these words: O noble lady unaware (of what had happened), I am guiltless. Why do you upbraid me? You know well my profound, steadfast affection for Raghava (Rama). Did not the one who counselled the banishment of my noble brother who is steadfast and bound by truth and virtue, ever adhered to scriptures? (or) My noble brother (Rama), the best among the virtuous, bound to truth, is banished. Let not such thought occur at any time to one who steadfastly adheres to scriptures May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother, Rama be cursed with the sin of undergoing servitude in the hands of most sinful of men, the sin of passing urine facing the Sun and of kicking a sleeping cow. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the demerit of unrighteousness in the same way as a master who gets a difficult work done by a servant without remuneration. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way as a man  acting treacherously against a king who rules like a father and protects his subjects like his own children, acquires. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire unrighteousness in the same way as a king who, having received one sixth of the income as tax from people does not protect them May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way as a person acquires for having promised the ascetics the required offering at a sacrifice and later denies them May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the demerit in the same way as a person, who having gone to the battleground abundantly provided with elephants, horses, chariots and weapons fails to discharge the duty (of a fighter) May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire demerit in the same way as an evilhearted person who forever destroys the subtle meaning of the scriptures imparted carefully by a sagacious preceptor May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother be highly unfortunate like me in not being able to behold that longarmed and broadshoulderd one seated on the throne and resembling both the Sun and the Moon in radiance May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the demerit in the same way as a person, who partakes the sweet milkrice, sesamerice and goat's flesh without purpose (without invoking and offering it to the gods) and disrespects the teachers May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a person who kicks the cows abuses elders and causes great offence to his friends May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother, acquire the sin in the same way as a wickedminded person, who divulges the words of abuse secretly confided in him by his friends. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother be hated universally as one who never helps any one, who is ungrateful, shameless and as one who has committed the sin of suicide May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother  acquire the sin in the same way as one who, although surrounded by wife, children and servants, eats the delicacies all alone without sharing acquires. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother die without winning a worthy wife and without begetting offspring and without performing religious deeds May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother live an entire life of anguish without begetting children through his wife or without seeing his own children May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the same sin as one acquires for murdering a king, a woman, children and the aged and deserting dependents May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the same sin as one who supports his wife and children by trafficking in lac, wine, meat and metal and poison acquires May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the same sin like a warrior, dreadful to the enemy side who will be slain while fleeing from the war at its peak May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother, wander this earth, begging alms, holding a human skull like an insane man dressed in rags May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother be always addicted to wine, women and gambling and be swayed by desire and anger May the mind of that man who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother not be established in virtue May he practise unrighteousness and confer charity on the unworthy May that man's accumulated extensive posssessions of various kinds of wealth be  snatched away by thieves in thousands of ways if he had counselled the exile of my esteemed brother May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the extent of demerit fixed for a person, who sleeps at the hour of twilight of dawn and dusk May that one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way as a person who sets fire to human settlements, violates the preceptors's bed and betrays his friend May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother, acquire the sin in the same way as a person who fails to show obedience to the gods and the ancestors and to serve his parents May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother be expelled  this very moment from the world approved by virtuous men, from their renown and from their (noble) actions The one who counselled the exile of my noble, longarmed and broadchested brother be banished like the one who commited the sin of leaving the ministration to his mother and engaging himself in purposeless acts May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother be always miserable with many sons, poverty and fever and disease May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a person disappoints who miserable mendicants seeking alms and looking up to him for help May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way as a person, who is abusive, niggardly, impure, unrighteous and always afraid of being caught by the king, and lives by cheating others, acquires May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way as a wickedminded person who neglects his chaste wife observing the menstrual period unfavourable for conception and had bathed after menstruation  acquires May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a foolish person who abandons righteous conduct and  forsakes his rightfully married wife and resorts to other man's wife acquires May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the same sin like that of a lowbred brahmin who commits an irreversible sin acquires May the sin of polluting drinking water and administering poison to others be put together and be incurred by the man who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a person with befouled senses disturbs the offerings of worship kept ready for a brahmin and milks the cow having a young calf acquires. May the one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a person who in possession of water does not give it to one suffering from thirst acquires it May that one who counselled the exile of my esteemed brother acquire the sin in the same way a person acquires while giving onesided judgement between divided religious disputants While thus appeasing Kausalya deprived of her husband and son, Bharata, filled with grief, fell down at her feet. Kausalya said these words to Bharata who fell unconscious, consumed with grief, while swearing on painful oaths. O son by swearing on oaths, you are choking the very breath of my life and my suffering has grown still more. O dear child, fortunately your mind is unswerved from righteousness. You being truthful to your promise shall attain the world of virtuous men along with Lakshmana. After having addressed Bharata, who was affectionate towards his brother that way, Kausalya  drew the mightyarmed one onto her lap and hugged him and cried out with extreme grief. Afflicted by sorrow and lamenting thus, great Bharata's mind became unsteady owing to swooning and  besieged by grief.",
                "Vasistha, the most eloquent and the best of ascetics said to Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi who was tormented with grief: O prince of great renown, may God bless you It is not proper on your part to grieve. It is time to perform the funeral rites of the king in the best way possible. On hearing the words of Vasistha, dutiful Bharata regained his steadiness and engaged in the performance of the funeral rites. The mortal remains of king Dasaratha, protector of the earth, was taken out of the oil container and placed on the floor. His pale, yellow face appeared as if he was asleep. Thereafter it was laid upon a magnificent couch adorned with every kind of gem. On seeing Dasaratha in that state  Bharata lamented in extreme distress. The mortal remains of king Dasaratha, protector of the earth, was taken out of the oil container and placed on the floor. His pale, yellow face appeared as if he was asleep. Thereafter it was laid upon a magnificent couch adorned with every kind of gem. On seeing Dasaratha in that state  Bharata lamented in extreme distress. What have you done, O king, between my absence and my arrival? You have banished the righteous Rama and the valiant Lakshmana. O great king Where will you go leaving me who is bewailing for having been left by Rama, the lion among men and a man of pious deeds? O king O father you have gone to heaven and Rama has taken shelter in the forest now. Who will take care of the welfare and security of your city? O king bereft of you, the earth (kingdom) is widowed and has lost its radiance. The city appears to me like a moonless night. To Bharata who was thus lamenting with a dejected mind, the great ascetic Vasistha once again said: O mightyarmed prince, the funeral rites that are required to be performed for the departed king ought to be done carefully without any shortcomings. Bharata said, 'Be it so' in obedience to Vasistha, who hastened up the learned Vedic scholars, family priests and preceptors to perform various rites. The sacrificial fire of the king has been put outside the firesanctuary in accordance with the ritual precepts and were withdrawn by the attendants and priests wellversed in Vedic lore. Thereafter the attendants raised the mortal remains of the deceased king onto a litter, with dejected minds, throats choked with tears and carried him away. The people went ahead of the king's body strewing on the way gold of brilliant colour and different kinds of garments. In this way others brought sandal, agaru and fragrant gum gugul, the resin of balsa tree and woods of sarala, padmaka and devadaru and built a pyre and strew many kinds of fragrant substances on it. Thereafter the priests laid the mortal remains of the king in the centre of the pyre. In this way others brought sandal, agaru and fragrant gum gugul, the resin of balsa tree and woods of sarala, padmaka and devadaru and built a pyre and strew many kinds of fragrant substances on it. Thereafter the priests laid the mortal remains of the king in the centre of the pyre. Then the priests offering oblations to the king's fire, intoned prayers. The reciters of Sama Veda sang the hymns in accordance with the sacred scriptures. Then in accordance with their rank and surrounded by aged guards, the wives of  king Dasaratha departed for that place from the city in palanquins and other carriages. Then the priests and other women led by Kausalya who was consumed with grief circumambulated the pyre in the reverse direction as the king's body was engulfed by flames. At that time, piteous cries of distressed women in their thousands like the piercing cries of female kraunchas (birds) were heard. Thereafter, the courtesans weeping uncontrollably and, lamenting again and again, alighted from carriages on the bank of the river Sarayu. The wives of the king, counsellors and priests along with Bharata offered waterlibation and entered the city with tearful eyes. They spent the tenday  mourning period sleeping on the ground (floor) in great grief.       Thus ends the seventysixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having observed the tenday mourning period, Bharata purified himself on the twelfth day and got the shraddha rites (obsequies) performed. During the shraddha ceremony (obsequies) Bharata bestowed on brahmins precious stones, wealth, large quantities of rice, highly valuable garments and various gems. At the time of performing the rites pertaining to the other world, Bharata bestowed on brahmins herds of white goats, cows in hundreds, male and female servants and spacious houses and carriages. Thereafter at the hour of dawn on the thirteenth day mightyarmed Bharata visited the cemetery to perform the purificatory ceremony. Approaching the place of the funeral pyre of his father, he lamented in the intensity of grief: Thereafter at the hour of dawn on the thirteenth day mightyarmed Bharata visited the cemetery to perform the purificatory ceremony. Approaching the place of the funeral pyre of his father, he lamented in the intensity of grief: O dear father, my brother Rama to whom you have entrusted me has been sent to the forest now and I am  left in a vacuum. Where have you gone, my king my father, forsaking mother Kausalya who is without a protector and whose only support Rama, her son has been sent away to the forest? Having seen the circular place, looking reddishbrown with burnt bones and ashes, where his father's body was consumed by fire, Bharata started crying aloud in deep despondency. On seeing the cremation ground desolate Bharata collapsed sobbing on the ground like a fastened flag staff of Indra, which fell as it was being raised. Immediately all his counsellors ran towards him like the ascetics who raised Yayati, a man of pious vows, when he fell down at the final hour. Beholding Bharata, Satrughna also plunged in grief remembering the king, and fell unconscious on the ground. Recollecting the many virtues of his father again and again, like a madman, Satrughna, mentally unsteady, lamented in profound sorrow. With Manthara as the source, Kaikeyi as a crocodile, this terrible sea of sorrow which has submerged all of us lies unruffled. Where have you gone dear father, leaving the lamenting Bharata, so young and tender, who was always your darling? You used to make all of us choose delicious food, drinks, garments and ornaments. Who else will do that now? You are a righteous and mighty king and without you, this earth would have been broken into pieces. But it does not. With my father ascended to heaven and Rama gone to the forest, where is the strength in me to live? I shall enter the blazing fire. Devoid of my father and brother, I will not return to empty Ayodhya that was once ruled by the Ikshvakus. I will enter the grove of asceticism . Having heard the lamentataions of both the brothers and reflecting the calamity befallen on them, the attendants felt extremely afflicted once again. Thereafter, both Satrughna and Bharata, dejected and exhausted, lay writhing on the  floor like two bulls with their horns broken. Then his father's family priest Vasistha of composed mind and versed in the Vedas  raised Bharata and said to him: O lord, this is the thirteenth day since the death of your father. The heap of bones and ashes still remain on the pyre. Why this delay on your part? There are three dualities  (hunger and thirst, pain and pleasure, birth and death), which are applicable to all living beings without any exception and cannot be eschewed. Therefore, it does not behove you to act in this way. The knower of reality Sumantra helped Satrughna to rise, after having consoled him, imparted him the truth about the inevitability of birth and death. Having risen from the earth both the illustrious tigers among men, Bharata and Satrughna looked  faded and weather beaten like the banners of Indra that had faded under the Sun and rain. The counsellors hastened up both the sons, who were wiping away the tears and speaking with blodshot eyes, to complete the remaining part of  the funeral rites.       Thus ends the seventyseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As the griefstricken Bharata was intending to proceed to Rama, Lakshmana's younger brother Satrughna said to him: Couldn't the mighty Rama who is the ultimate refuge of all beings protect himself in his own distress? That Rama has been exiled to the forest by a woman. And why did not Lakshmana who is strong and powerful release Rama from exile by restraining our father? In the first place, the king could have restrained himself by reflecting on whether the course of action adopted by him under the influence of a woman was just or unjust. While Satrughna, brother of Lakshmana was conversing thus, the hunchback Manthara decorated with all kinds of ornaments arrived at the entrance. She had besmeared herself with the essence of sandal, had put on royal garments and adorned herself in many ways with every kind of ornament. Tied with colourful girdle strings and wearing many other auspicious ornaments, she looked like a female monkey tied with a rope. Seeing the hunchback, doer of many sinful deeds, the gatekeepers caught hold of her and informed Satrughna. Here is that sinful, cruel woman on whose account Rama is in the forest and your father has forsaken his body. Do with her as it pleases you. Intensely grieved to hear those words, Satrughna who was steadfast in his vows said to the inmates of the inner apartment: Let this woman, who caused deep sorrow to our brothers and father, reap the fruit of her malicious actions. Saying thus, he forcibly caught hold of the hunchback amidst her companions when she filled the house with her cries. Perceiving the enraged Satrughna all her companions shook in terror and fled in different directions. All her companions conversed among themselves. The way he began, it looks he will finish all of us. Let us seek refuge under the illustrious Kausalya, who is compassionate, generous,  and knower of righteousness. She is our sure saviour. With bloodshot eyes Satrughna, the scorcher of enemies, dragged the shrieking hunchback down the ground in fury. While Manthara was being dragged by Satrughna, the collection of ornaments of many colours and of various kinds worn by her were broken and  scattered here and there all over the ground. The resplendent royal palace, strewn all over with several ornaments on the ground  shone like the autumnal sky (studded with innumerable stars). The mighty and the best of men Satrughna seized with fury, forcibly caught hold of that hunchback and censured Kaikeyi with harsh words. Kaikeyi, deeply distressed at those harsh and grievous words was afraid of Satrughna and sought the protection of her son Bharata. Bharata, addressing the enraged Satrughna said Of all beings a lady is not to be killed.  Pardon her. If righteous Rama were not to accuse me of slaying a mother, I would have killed the sinful Kaikeyi of wicked deeds myself. If righteous Rama comes to know that this hunchback has been slain by us, he will certainly never talk to you or me. Hearing the words of Bharata, Satrughna, the younger brother of Lakshmana restrained his fury and also released Manthara. Manthara, tormented with grief, fell at the feet of Kaikeyi and began heaving deep sighs. . Seeing the hunchback thrown down by Satrughna and lying senseless and anguished like a female krauncha bird caught in a net looking in different directions, Kaikeyi gently soothed her.       Thus ends the seventyeighth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then, at the hour of dawn on the fourteenth day, all those who were empowered to proclaim the king,  assembled and addressed Bharata: Dasaratha, who was our most revered master and preceptor, having exiled his eldest son Rama and mighty Lakshmana, ascended heaven. O illutrious prince do assume kingship now. Incidentally, there has been yet no attack on this leaderless kingdom. O prince of the Raghu race (Bharata), your subjects and guilds of traders, artisans, etc, have procured necessary materials for your consecration, and  await you. O best among men, inherit this stable kingdom of your ancestors, get yourself consecrated and save us. Bharata, firm in vows, circumambulated all the articles procured in connection with consecration, and replied them as follows: It has been the tradition in our race that the eldest son alone should always inherit the kingdom. It does not behove intelligent people like you to tell me like this. Our eldest brother, Rama shall become king. As for me, I shall dwell in the forest for fourteen years. Let the great and powerful army of four divisions be marshalled. I will bring back my eldest brother Rama from the forest. I shall go to the forest to (bring back) Rama, with all these articles, procured for coronation kept in front. After coronating Rama, the best of men, there itself, I will definitely bring him back, letting him go ahead of me, like the sacred fire carried from the place of sacrifice. I shall never fulfil the wishes of that woman called my mother. I shall dwell in the inaccessible forest and Rama shall become king. Let the road be aligned by artisans and uneven ground be levelled. The guards who judge the inaccessible terrains should follow them on their way. When prince Bharata was thus speaking in favour of Rama, all the people responded with these excellent, propitious words: May Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, abide in you for having expressed your desire to bestow the kingdom upon the king's eldest son. With such graceful words spoken by the prince within their hearing, tears of joy filled the eyes of the noble people and fell drop by drop down their faces. All the ministers and members of the council, relieved of their distress, were delighted to hear these words and said O best among men, on your orders devoted people and groups of artisans have been instructed to lay the road.       Thus ends the seventyninth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then surveyors, experts in measurment, energetic and zealous labourers, excavators, engineers, skilled workers, architects, craftsmen, carpenters, roadlevellers, woodcutters, welldiggers, whitewashers, basketmakers, competent supervisors were sent in advance. Then surveyors, experts in measurment, energetic and zealous labourers, excavators, engineers, skilled workers, architects, craftsmen, carpenters, roadlevellers, woodcutters, welldiggers, whitewashers, basketmakers, competent supervisors were sent in advance. Then surveyors, experts in measurment, energetic and zealous labourers, excavators, engineers, skilled workers, architects, craftsmen, carpenters, roadlevellers, woodcutters, welldiggers, whitewashers, basketmakers, competent supervisors were sent in advance. Like a swollen ocean on a fullmoon day the multitude of people proceeded joyfully with great speed to the appointed place. Those groups who were skilled in the construction of roads took up their places with every kind of tool and departed ahead of others. Clearing and cutting branches of various trees and creepers, shrubs, plants branchless trees and hewing boulders, the road was paved by the king's men. Some of them, planted saplings in places where there were none, while some others severed trees here and there with axes, hatchets and sickles. Some other stronger men, plucked the strongrooted tufts of fragrant grass. Here and there they made impassable terrains even. Some filled wells and chasms with loose soil, while others made low level grounds plain and wide on all sides. People threw bridges at places that needed to be bridged. They pulverised stones that obstructed the path and split open big stones to drain out water. In a short time they constructed many water reservoirs of different shapes capable of holding large volumes of water like the sea. In arid places, various good drinkingwaterwells surrounded by dykes were dug. The highway for the army was paved smooth, with its surface decorated with mosaic.  It was lined with blossoming trees with flocks of birds intoxicated with singing. It was decked with banners and sprinkled with sandal water and a strewn with flowers of every kind. Like the path of gods, the highway shone with brilliance. The highway for the army was paved smooth, with its surface decorated with mosaic.

Men wellversed in the study of planetary positions relating to auspicious constellations and auspicious times arranged different restingplaces at different times during the sojourn of great Bharata. They heaped sand and dug moats around the restingplace. It was adorned with wellbuilt highways and broad thoroughfares, lined with mansions surrounded by walls as high as mount Indrakeela. The peaks of those tall residences decorated with flags which looked as if spreading into the sky. (Thus the restingplace) shone like the abode of Indra.

Thus ends the eightieth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter bards and panegyrists adept in conversation with an auspicious start pleased Bharata with eulogy in the last part of the night. The drums of the night watch were beaten by golden sticks. Conches in hundreds were blown and sounds of various modulations were created. The shrill trempets which seemed to fill the heavens caused much more distress to the already griefstricken Bharata. Then Bharata waking up, exclaimed, I am not the king, ordered the pipers to stop and said to Satrughna: O Satrughna see what great harm has been done to these people at the instance of Kaikeyi. King Dasaratha has gone, leaving me to suffer. This kingdom, rooted in the righteousness of that noble king, is now whirling like a boat in a whirlpool without a helmsman. Even Rama, a great protector for all of us, has been banished to the forest by my mother bereft of virtuous conduct. Thus lamenting, Bharata fainted. Seeing him (in this state) all the women (of the inner apartment) at once cried aloud piteously. While Bharata was weeping, illustrious Vasistha, conversant with royal traditions, entered the assembly hall of the lord of the Iksvakus (king Dasaratha). Righteous Vasistha along with his disciples reached the lovely golden assembly hall  inlaid with gems and precious stones, which resembled Sudharma, (the assembly hall of Indra). Vasistha, wellversed in all the Vedas, sat on a golden seat with a comfortable cover and ordered the messengers: Fetch quietly brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas, ministers and army commanders at once. A matter of great urgency awaits us. Bring all the royal attendants, Satrughna, the illustrious Bharata, Yudhajit, Sumantra and all those wellwishers of the king. As they (invitees) began arriving on chariots, horses and elephants, there arose a great tumult. Then as Bharata apprroached,  ministers and subjects greeted him as they used to greet Dasaratha, just as gods greet Indra, the performer of a hundred sacrifices. The assembly hall looked splendid like a lake of tranquil waters with gems, shells  pebbles, grains of sand and teeming with whales and serpents in the presence of the son of king Dasaratha. It appeared as though Dasaratha himself was present.       Thus ends the eightyfirst sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sagacious Bharata beheld that assembly hall filled with honourable members, like the fullmoon beholds the night stretching forth (with stars). When the seats were occupied by the honourable members according to their rank, that august assembly looked splendid with the brilliance of their apparels and fragrance of unguents. The most splendid assembly filled with learned people looked brilliant like the night with the autumnal fullmoon. The chief priest Vasistha, knower of righteousness, looked at all the ministers present and addressed Bharata in a gentle voice. O dear child following the righteous path king Dasaratha conferred on you this vast kingdom abounding in wealth and grains before attaining heaven. Abiding in truth, remembering the righteous ways of virtuous men just as the rising Moon does not leave its beams, Rama too did not move away from his father's command. The kingdom free from obstacles has been passed on to you by your father and brother. Get yourself coronated quickly and enjoy it along with your cheerful ministers. Let kings from the north, the west, the south, the bordering kingdoms, and the seatraders offer you crores of gems as gifts. On hearing those words, Bharata who knew his duty was overwhelmed with distress and, resolved to abide by righteousness, reached Rama through his mind (thought of Rama). Young Bharata with the melodious voice of a swan, choked with tears, lamenting in the assembly, reproached the family priest Vasistha, saying: Would any man seize this kingdom which rightfully belongs to sagacious Rama, who practises brahmacharya, who is wellversed in all branches of learning and who endeavours to protect righteousness? How can any usurper of the kingdom be born of Dasaratha? Or, how would any progeny of Dasaratha become the usurper of the kingdom? I and the kingdom, both belong to Rama. You should tell the truth about this. The eldest, eminent and righteous Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, who is comparable to Dilipa and Nahusha deserves to inherit this kingdom just as Dasaratha did. If I commit this evil act followed by wretched people which would not lead any one to  heaven, I shall only be bringing disgrace to the kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty. I will never accept the evil deed committed by my mother. From here itself I shall pay obeisance with folded palms to my brother who dwells in the impenetrable forest. I shall follow Rama the best among men. He alone and no one else deserves to rule over the kingdom of the three worlds. Hearing the words of Bharata full of righteousness, all the men assembled there   shed tears of joy, thinking of Rama. If I am not able to bring back my noble brother (Rama) from the forest, I shall also dwell there like my noble brother Lakshmana. I shall employ all possible means to bring him back and join you who are respectable, virtuous and pious. I have already despatched the explorers and protectors of roads who work for wages and without wages as well. It also pleases me to undertake this journey. Righteous Bharata who was full of devotion towards his brother having uttered thus, addressed  the skilful counsellor Sumantra standing nearby: O Sumantra quickly rise and go. On my authority, order the expedition and let the army be marshalled at once. On hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharata, Sumantra was delighted and as  instructed, ordered everything as if he was anxious to do it himself. Having come to know that orders were issued to send the army on an expedition to bring back Rama, the subjects and the army chiefs were delighted. Then, the wives of the soldiers having come to know of the expedition were all delighted and in every household hastened up their husbands. Those chiefs of the army urged the soldiers, horses, fastmoving bullockcarts and swift chariots (to move on). When Bharata saw that the army was ready, he instructed Sumantra who was standing by the side of the preceptor to quickly prepare his chariot. He (Sumantra) received the command of Bharata in great delight and set out with a chariot harnessed with excellent horses. Bharata, a descendant of the Raghu race, firm in truth, one whose valour comes out of unswerving truth, speaking judiciously said this to propitiate his esteemed brother who was in the dense forest: O Sumantra, arise, go at once to the leaders of the army and ask them to assemble the troops. I shall propifiate Rama who is in the deep forest and bring him back for the welfare of the world. The charioteer categorically commanded by Bharata, his desire fulfilled, communicated the royal mandate to all important subjects, chiefs of army and friends. Thereafter, men from every household, kshatriyas, vaisyas, sudras and brahmins came out and harnessed their chariots to the camels and asses, elephants and horses of high pedigree.       Thus ends the eightysecond sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Getting up at dawn, Bharata boarded his excellent chariot and set forth swiftly, longing to see Rama. All the ministers and priests went ahead of Bharata mounting their chariots,  harnessed with horses and resembling the chariot of the Sun god. As per tradition, nine thousand elephants were arranged to follow Bharata, delight of the race of the Ikshvakus as he set out. Sixty thousands chariots and many archers holding weapons of every kind followed the illustrious prince Bharata as he went. One hundred thousand horses each mounted by a rider followed Bharata, one who had conquered  his passion and adhered to truth. Kaikeyi, Sumitra as well as the illustrious Kausalya travelled by a resplendent chariot, delighted with the thought of bringing Rama back. Venerable people in groups, narrating various accomplishments of Rama and eager to see him with Lakshmana, proceeded in a delightful mood. When shall we see that mightyarmed Rama of darkblue complexion like the raincloud, firm in strength and steadfast in vows and the destroyer of the sorrows of  this world? At his sight alone our sorrows will be dispelled, the way the darkness of the entire world is dispelled by the rising Sun. The inhabitants of the town proceeded joyfully, narrating Rama's delightful achievements on their way by embracing one another. Respectable city folks, like traders and other subjects went along in great delight towards Rama. Gempolishers, potters, weaponsmiths, weavers, makers of adornments with peacock feathers, sawyers, makers of artificial ornaments, perforators of shells and ornaments, ivoryworkers, whitewashers, purveyors of fragrant essences, renowned goldsmiths, blanketcleaners, hotbath attendants, physicians, vintners, incense merchants, washermen, tailors, headmen of villages and hamlets, actors along with their wives, fishermen -- all followed Bharata.

Brahmins learned in the Vedas and renowned for their virtuous conduct followed Bharta in their thousands on bullock carts with composed minds. Dressed well in clean clothes and anointed with pure red sandalpaste, they all slowly followed Bharata, mounting on various vehicles. The army, overwhelmed with joy and cheer followed the devoted brother Bharata who had set out to bring back Rama. After travelling a long distance on chariots, carriages, horses and elephants, they reached the river Ganga close to Srngiberapura, a country ruled vigilantly by Rama's friend, the valiant Guha who lived there along with his relatives. After travelling a long distance on chariots, carriages, horses and elephants, they reached the river Ganga close to Srngiberapura, a country ruled vigilantly by Rama's friend, the valiant Guha who lived there along with his relatives. The army following Bharata reached the bank of the river Ganga, graced by chakravakas (ruddy geese) and halted there. As he beheld the army following him and the river Ganga of sacred waters in front of him, Bharata who was proficient in speech said to his ministers: You may, according to your convenience, halt the army anywhere here and, after taking rest (for the night), we shall cross the river Ganga tomorrow. Meanwhile, I shall get into this river and offer libations with water to the departed king for the good of his life in the other world. While he (Bharata's) was speaking this way, all the ministers assented by saying 'Be it so' and made arrangement for their troops to rest separately according to their pleasure. The army encamped by Bharata looked splendid with royal insigaia. After making necessary arrangements for the army on the bank of the mighty river Ganga and pondering over the means of bringing back the magnanimous Rama, Bharata stayed.       Thus ends the eightythird sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Guha, king of the nishadas, observed the bannered army encamped all along the bank of the river Ganga, hurried off and said to his kinsmen: Here is an army as vast as the ocean, and I am unable to comprehend its magnitude even mentally. It appears that the evilminded Bharata himself has come here. The emblem of a huge kovidara (pomegranate) tree is seen on his chariot. Could it be that Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, has come here to bind us with the cords or to slay us? Or is he marching forward with the intention of taking possession of a prosperous, rare kingdom by slaying Rama who has been banished by his father: Could it be that Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, has come here to bind us with the cords or to slay us? Or is he marching forward with the intention of taking possession of a prosperous, rare kingdom by slaying Rama who has been banished by his father: Rama, son of Dasaratha, is not only my master but also my friend. Therefore, to safeguard his interests remain stationed here on the bank of the river Ganga. Let all the fishermen, who live on meat, roots and fruits and protect the river, stay here with the troops by taking up positions along the banks of the river Ganga. Let five hundred boats, each manned by a hundred young fishermen fully equipped, be in readiness he exhorted them. Should it happen that Bharata is not illdisposed toward Rama, the army will safe cross the river Ganga today itself. Having spoken thus, Guha, lord of the nishadas, approached Bharata, taking with him fish, meat and wine as offerings. The valiant Sumantra, conversant with ways of modesty, observed Guha approaching them and humbly informed Bharata. Guha who has come here surrounded by too many thousands of his relations is fully acquainted with the Dandaka forest. He is an aged man and a friend of your brother said Sumatra. O scion of the Kakusthas (Bharata) therefore, give audience to the overlord of the nishadas, Guha, who undoubtedly knows the whereabouts of Rama and Lakshmana. On hearing these auspicious words of Sumantra, Bharata said Let Guha see me at once. Having obtaind the permission, a delighted Guha, escorted by his relatives,  approached Bharata and humbly said: This country is like a pleasuregarden at the backyard of your palace. All of us are  subordinate to you and we solicit you to stay in the house of  this servant of yours. Here are roots, fruits and a great variety of forest produce, fresh and dried meat brought by the nishadas. We hope your army having  refreshed themselves will spend the night here. With our hospitality extended, you can proceed tomorrow.       Thus ends the eightyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When thus spoken to, Bharata, a great intellectual, replied to Guha with these well thought out and meaningful words. O dear friend of my elder brother, your desire to extend hospitality to this large army all alone is indeed noble. Having spoken to Guha courteously, the majestic, radiant Bharata continued: O Guha this region of Ganga with its dense forest is very difficult to cross. How can I reach the hermitage of Bharadwaja? When he heard those words of the sagacious Bharata, Guha the forest ranger answered him reverentially with folded palms. O prince of great renown I shall follow you, wellprepared with these fishermen, armed with bows. Are you not going to that place with the evil intention of causing harm to Rama of unwearied actions? This large army of yours arouses doubts in me. When he heard Guha thus speaking, Bharata who was as tranquil as the sky, said to him in a gentle voice. That calmitous time will never come (again). You should not suspect me. I look upon Rama, my eldest brother, as my father. I am going to bring back that scion of the kakutsthas (Rama) who resides in the forest. O Guha, do not entertain any other thought. I am tellng you the truth. When he heard those words of Bharata, Guha was delighted and his face beamed with joy as he said to Bharata: Blessed indeed you are as you desire to renounce the kingdom that has come to you effortlessly. I see none equal to you on this earth. You desire to bring back Rama who is in great difficulty. This everlasting fame of yours will spread all over the world. As Guha was thus conversing with Bharata, the rays of the Sun diminished and the night set in. Fortunate Bharata gratified by Guha encamped his army and retired to bed along with Satrughna. But the thought of Rama caused grief to the magnanimous Bharata, a man of righteous outlook who did not deserve such grief. Just like a concealed forestfire scorching the dried up forest, the fire of sorrow kindled in his mind scorched Bharata. Like the ice melted by the heat of the Sun's rays flows down the Himalayas, sweat poured from all parts of his body caused by the fire of grief. Bharata, son of Kaikeyi was stricken by a lofty mountain of grief. The cavityless rocks of that mountain were his contemplation, the minerals were his sighs, the multitude of trees were his desolation, peaks were his fatigue and mental distress, the unlimited number of animals were his stupor, the bamboo tree was his sorrow.

The cavityless rocks of that mountain were his contemplation, the minerals were his sighs, the multitude of trees were his desolation, peaks were his fatigue and mental distress, the unlimited number of animals were his stupor, the bamboo tree was his sorrow. Then best of men, Bharata, with highly distraught mind and heaving sighs, with senses bewildered and oppressed by the fever raging in his heart and caught in a great calamity, like a bull separated from the herd enjoyed no peace of mind. Bharata, a man of great magnanimity, joined Guha together with his people with composed mind. Then Guha, greatly distraught, again consoled  Bharata  regarding his elder brother Rama.       Thus ends the eightyfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Guha, the forest ranger, described to Bharata the countless qualities of the goodnatured, magnanimous Lakshmana: I spoke to the virtuous Lakshmana, who was holding arrows, bow and sword in his hand and keeping awake completely for the protection of his brother. My friend, Lakshmana, the delight of the Raghavas this comfortable couch has been arranged for you. Lie down peacefully without any anxiety. O righteous one you are used to conforts where as all of our people are accustomed to hardships. So we will stay awake and protect Rama. To me, there is none on earth dearer than Rama. Do not have any anxiety. I am telling you the truth. By the grace of Rama, I want to acquire in this world great renown, abundance of righteousness, absolute artha (prosperity) and kama (pleasure). As for me, bow in hand and all my kinsmen with me, I shall protect my dear friend Rama who is resting with Sita. Nothing is unknown to me in this forest in which I range about continually. We can withstand an army of four divisions in a battle. The magnanimous Lakshmana, established in dharma, replied: While Rama sleep on the ground with Sita, how can I find sleep or joy or comfort? O Guha behold Rama, whom gods and demons combined cannot withstand in a battle now lying on a bed of grass with Sita. Rama is the only one among the sons who resembles his father in various virtues. Dasaratha obtained him after a great deal of austerities and efforts as well. After Rama is exiled, king Dasaratha will not survive for long and surely the earth will soon be widowed. The women of the inner apartment who lamented loudly, must have stopped weeping out of weariness. By now, the clamour in the king's palace would have surely subsided. I doubt whether the king, Kausalya and my mother Sumitra and the rest of them will outlive this night. My mother might live, looking at Satrughna. But Kausalya, who is the mother of a hero, will die from extreme grief. My father, king Dasaratha, failing to fulfil his cherished desires one after another and unable to place Rama on the throne, will pass away. When the moment of death arrives for my father, those who perform the funeral rites for him would have fulfilled their desire. There in the capital of my father with its lovely crossroads and squares, welllaid  highways, full of mansions and palaces encrusted with all kinds of precious stones, teeming with elephants, horses and chariots, resounding with trumpets, and with wellbeing everywhere, and plenty of pleasuregardens, and parks and community festivals, people sound in health would be moving about in great comfort.

Can we ever reenter Ayodhya happily after safely fulfilling the vow and completing the term of exile? While the highminded prince was lamenting this way and was waiting, the night passed off. The next morning when the Sun shone bright, both of them matted their hair on the bank of the river Bhagirathi (Ganga) and I ferried them across comfortably. Rama and Lakshmana, slayers of enemies, who are as strong as bull elephants, with their hair matted, wearing robes made of bark, armed with excellent bows, arrows and swords went along with Sita looking around (vigilantly).       Thus ends the eightysixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Extremely unhappy over what he heard from Guha, Bharata was immersed in thought then and there. The delicate, youthful, highly energetic and mightyarmed Bharata of graceful appearance, with shoulders like that of a lion and wideeyed like lotus petals, recovered for a moment and with a mind deeply distressed fell down at once like an elephant smitten by a goad. The delicate, youthful, highly energetic and mightyarmed Bharata of graceful appearance, with shoulders like that of a lion and wideeyed like lotus petals, recovered for a moment and with a mind deeply distressed fell down at once like an elephant smitten by a goad. Seeing Bharata in that state, Satrughna who was standing close by, smitten with grief clasped him, cried loudly and fell senseless. Then Bharata's mothers, who were emaciated due to fasting and afflicted by the calamity of the death of their husband were desolate, rushed towards him. Sobbing, they gathered around Bharata who had fallen on the ground, while Kausalya approached him in a depressed state and took him into her arms. Desolate Kausalya, in deep distress, clasped Bharata out of filial love as if he were her own child, wept and enquired of him: O son I hope you are not affected by illness. Now the existence of this royal house devolves on you. O my son, with Rama gone to the forest along with your brother Lakshmana and with king Dasaratha departed from this world, I continue to live seeing you. From now on you alone are our sole protector. O my son, I hope you have not heard any unpleasant news about Lakshmana or about my only son Rama who has gone to the forest along with his wife. Highly renowned Bharata, composing himself for a moment and still weeping, reassured Kauslaya, and then said this to Guha: O Guha where did my brother Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spend that night? What did they eat? On what couch did they sleep? Tell me all that. Thereupon delighted Guha, overlord of the nishadas, told Bharata all that he had provided to Rama, his beloved friend and guest: I offered Rama rice including a variety of eatables like fruits in great quantity for his food. Rama whose prowess is his truth, acknowledged all that but remembering the duty enjoined on a kshatriya did not accept them. O king that great Rama entreated us in a friendly manner by saying 'O friend we should always give to others but should never accept anything from others'. Illustrious Rama along with Sita only drank the water brought by Lakshamana and  undertook fasting. Thereafter Lakshmana also drank the remainder of water. Then all the three observing silence intently performed the evening worship. Therafter, the son of Sumitra (Lakshmana) himself fetched darbha grass and quickly prepared an auspicious and comfortable bed for Rama. Rama lay down upon the bed along with Sita. Thereafter Lakshmana, having washed their feet, moved to a distant place. Here at the foot of the ingudi tree and upon that bed of grass both Rama and Sita rested that night. Lakshmana, the scorcher of enemies, wearing protective covering for his palms and fingers (made of gohaskin), strapping on his back two quivers filled with arrows, holding a great bow, strung ready, stood sentinel throughout the night guarding the surrounding. Then, holding the best of arrows and bow along with my indefatigable kinsmen similarly armed with bows, I stood by the side of Lakshmana guarding Rama who is comparable to Indra.       Thus ends the eightyseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After listening to all that Guha had said, Bharatha reached the foot of the ingudi tree accompanied by his ministers and gazing at Rama's bed, said to all his mothers the magnanimous Rama rested that night here on this ground in that crushed bed.

It is unbelievable that such a thing has happened to Rama in this world. It does not seem real to me and looks appears like a dream and my mind is bewildered. Dasaratha's son, Rama had to rest on the ground would admittedly mean that no divine power is mightier than Time (Destiny). Sita, daughter of Janaka, king of Videha, and beloved daughterinlaw of Dasaratha who caused delight to the beholder, too had to rest on the bare ground. This is my brother's couch and it is here where he had tossed about. The grass spread on this hard surface is crushed by his limbs. Some particles of gold dust are seen stuck to this bed here and there. I think Sita might have rested on this excellent bed with all her jewellery. That the upper garment of Sita might have been caught here is well evident from the shining silken threads stuck. Hapless Sita is young and delicate. Being a chaste lady, she, even in these (adverse) circumstances, does not feel the brunt. Hence, maybe she thinks her husbands' (hard) bed comfortable to her. Alas, what suffering Because of a cruel man like me Rama along with his spouse was condemned to recline upon such bed like an orphan. How could such Rama sleep on the ground? He was born in the house of emperors, worthy of reverence by the entire world and beloved of all the worlds, with the complexion of a blue lotus, with red eyes, and pleasing looks, one who deserves to be happy and not to suffer by renouncing the kingdom and excellent comforts.

He was born in the house of emperors, worthy of reverence by the entire world and beloved of all the worlds, with the complexion of a blue lotus, with red eyes, and pleasing looks, one who deserves to be happy and not to suffer by renouncing the kingdom and excellent comforts. Surely Lakshmana of great merit and auspicious virtues is fortunate since he is accompanying his brother Rama in times of adversity. Sita has, indeed, accomplished her object by accompanying her husband (to the forest). Bereft of that magnanimous Rama, all of us are in doubt (if he will accept our services). King Dasaratha having ascended to heaven and Rama taken shelter in the forest, this kingdom appears to me like a ship without a helmsman. No one, even in thought, would ever desire this kingdom, protected by the strength of his arms even while residing in the forest. Now the gates of our capital city (Ayodhya) are wide open. The city is unprotected and endangered. There are no guards to keep vigil over the ramparts. The horses and elephants are not in control (hence unprepared for battle). The army is unhappy and demoralised. At this state even the enemies will not like to seize the city, they will shun it like food mixed with poison.

From today onwards, wearing matted hair and clad in robes made of bark and living on fruits and roots, I too shall sleep on the naked ground or on grass. Taking upon myself the vow of Rama, I too shall live in the forest cheerfully for the rest of the term on behalf of him so that his vow shall not prove untrue. As I live in the forest on behalf of my brother Rama, Satrughna will live with me. My esteemed brother Rama will rule Ayodhya along with Lakshmana. In Ayodhya the brahmins shall coronate Rama. Will the gods make this desire of mine true? I will seek his grace in many ways by bowing down my head. Even then if Rama does not grant my wish, I shall also live with him as long as it takes. He will not be able to ignore a forester like me.       Thus ends the eightyeigth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Bharata got up at daybreak after spending the night on the bank of the Ganga at that very place where Rama, the descendent of Raghu, had stayed. And said these words to Satrughna: O Satrughna, blessings to you Why are you still alseep? Arise fetch Guha the king of the nishadas quickly. He will ferry the army across the river. Urged by his brother Bharata, Satrughna replied 'I am not asleep. I am awake. I am deeply thinking of our esteemed brother, Rama' While the two lions among men, Bharata and Satrughna were thus conversing with each other, Guha came in the appropriate time and said to Bharata with folded palms: O scion of the Kakutstha race (Bharata) I trust, you and your army passed the night on the river bank comfortably without any inconvenience. On hearing Guha's affectionate words Bharata, ever obedient to Rama, replied: O king (Guha) the night passed comfortably for us. We have been honoured by you in many ways. Let your fishermen be ordered to ferry us across the Ganga in their boats. Then at Bharata's command Guha returned to his habitation quickly and said to his relations: Arise and awake. May you be ever blessed. Haul down the boats into the river. We have to ferry the army (across the river). On hearing these words, they arose in haste and immediately brought five hundred boats from every direction in accordance with the command of their king (Guha). They brought excellent boats known as Swastika, solidly built, they lookd magnificent, filled with large bells, sails and flags. Then Guha personally brought an auspicious boat known as Swastika covered with white canvas and generating captivating sounds. The family priest (Vasistha) and other brahmins were the first to board. Next mighty Bharata and Satrughna, Kausalya, Sumitra, women of the palace including the other wives of the king and wagons and supplies followed. The family priest (Vasistha) and other brahmins were the first to board. Next mighty Bharata and Satrughna, Kausalya, Sumitra, women of the palace including the other wives of the king and wagons and supplies followed. The clamour of the people setting fire to the temporary shelters in that camp, descending down the river and transporting the supplies into the boats reached the heaven. Those boats adorned with flags were propelled by the fishermen occupying them. They sailed with men rowing on board fast. Some boats were filled with women, some others with horses. while still others transported draught animals for drawing carriages and the great treasures. Having reached the other bank, the men disembarked. While returning, the fisherfolk exhibited their craft of lovely formations. The elephants, embellished with banners and goaded by their mahouts looked splendid like mountains with banners while crossing in the water. Only some of the people were able to board the boats. Some others crossed on rafts and on large pots. Still others swam with their arms. The auspicious army, ferried across the river Ganga by the fishermen, reached the great forest of Prayaga at the auspicious hour of Maitra. The noble Bharata, got his army encamped according to their pleasure and set out, accompanied by his priests, to see the distinguished sage Bharadwaja.",
                "Bharata, the knower of righteous ways and the best among men, saw the hermitage of Bharadwaja from a distance of one krosa and brought his entire army to a halt. He laid aside all his royal robes and weapons. Clad in silk garments, he went on foot along with his ministers, with the family priest Vasistha ahead of him. Bharata, the knower of righteous ways and the best among men, saw the hermitage of Bharadwaja from a distance of one krosa and brought his entire army to a halt. He laid aside all his royal robes and weapons. Clad in silk garments, he went on foot along with his ministers, with the family priest Vasistha ahead of him. Then the scion of the Raghu race (Bharata) halted his ministers within sight of Bharadwaja's (hermitage) and went along following his priest Vasistha. On seeing Vasistha, the great ascetic Bharadwaja immediately left his seat and said to his disciples, Bring offerings of water. After meeting Vasistha and greeted by Bharata, the radiant Bharadwaja could recognize he was the son of Dasaratha. Offering them both in order arghya (welcomeoffering), water to wash their feet and fruits in accordance with the practice, he enquired Bharata about the welfare of the family. He enquired about the welfare of Ayodhya, of the army, treasury, friends and the ministers. But knowingly did not mention about Dasaratha's wellbeing (the knew Dasaratha was dead). Vasistha and Bharata also enquired about his health and welfare of his sacred fires, his disciples, animals and birds and trees of the hermitage. Saying, all is well, the great ascetic Bharadwaja, out of his affection for Rama, said to Bharata: Why have you come here when you ought to be ruling the kingdom? Tell me everything about this. My mind is not clear in this matter. Rama, destroyer of enemies and enhancer of the delight of his mother Kausalya, has been banished to the forest for a long time along with his wife and brother. That illustrious one has been ordered by his father to live in the forest for fourteen years through the pursuasion of a woman. To enjoy the kingdom without obstacles do you intend to cause any harm to that irreproachable Rama and his brother?

To enjoy the kingdom without obstacles do you intend to cause any harm to that irreproachable Rama and his brother? At these words, Bharata, eyes filled with tears of grief, replied to Bharadwaja in a   stumbling voice: When one so venerable like you too misunderstands me, I am gone. There is no danger for him from me. Do not rebuke me this way. I do not approve of whatever my mother said in my absence. I am not happy with those words and I do not accept them. I have come to worship the feet of Rama, the best of men and persuade him to return to Ayodhya. O venerable one in consideration of the circumstances I am in, be kind to me and tell me the whereabouts of Rama, lord of the earth. Likewise besought by Vasistha and other priests, the venerable Bharadwaja was pleased to tell Bharata: O best of men (Bharata) your conduct towards the preceptors, your selfrestraint and devotion to the virtuous are all in keeping with those born in the race of Raghu. I am aware of the feelings in your heart. Even then I enquired in order to confirm it  and to further your fame. I know your brother who is conversant with righteousness is living on Chitrakuta mountain with Sita and Lakshmana. O supremely sagacious prince gifted with the knowledge of kama (desire) and artha (wealth), tomorrow you go, but to night stay here with your ministers and fulfil my desire. A man of liberal disposition, Bharata expressed his intention, saying, 'Be it so'. Then the prince made up him mind to spend the might in that hermitage.       Thus ends the ninetieth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "With the decision of Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, to stay there for the night, sage Bharadwaja extended to him all hospitality. Bharata said to Bharadwaja, You have already extended the hospitality in offering water for washing the feet with and of arghya befitting a guest as available in the forest. Bharadwaja then said to Bharata with a gentle smile, I know you are full of love and content with whatever is offered you. O Bharata, the best of men, I want to treat your army with food. This will please me and I hope you will act accordingly. Why did you, O Bharata, the best of men, station your army at a distance before coming here? Could you not approach me along with your army? With folded palms (in reverence), Bharata said to sage Bharadwaja whose penance was his wealth: I did not approach you with the army for fear of you, O venerable one. O venerable one a king or a prince ought to intentionally avoid those places occupied by ascetics. O venerable sage spirited horses, men and mighty rutting elephants follow me covering a wide expanse of land. Lest the army should damage the huts, trees, land, and defile the water in the ashram, I came here alone. Thus commanded the great ascetic, 'Let the army be brought here'. Accordingly, Bharata ordered the army to come. Then Bharadwaja entered the fire sanctuary, sipped water and washed his hands with water and invoked Visvakarma to provide hospitality. I intend to provide hospitality for which I am invoking Visvakarma and Tvastara who builds houses. Let adequate arrangements be made. I invoke the three deities, guardians of the four quarters headed by Indra to extend hospitality (to Bharata). Let them make adequate arrangements in this regard. Let the rivers flowing towards the east, and the west, flowing on the earth and in the sky, flowing everywhere reach here and now. Let some rivers flow with liquor made of datepalms, some with wellprepared wine and some with cool water which tastes like sugarcane juice. I invoke the gandharvas, Visvavasu, Ha Ha and Hu Hu, and also goddesses like gandharvas (heavenly musicians) and apsaras (nymphs) from all regions. I summon also Grutachi, Visvachi, Misrakesi, Alambusa, Nagadantha, Hema and Hima whose abode is on the mountain. I invoke all the women who attend on Indra and Bramha along with tumbur with all their (musical) instruments. Let Kubera's divine forest situated in the land of Kurus, where leaves serve as raiment and ornaments and celestial women as its fruits come here. Let the blessed Moon furnish me with excellent food of every kind -- solid, liquid, soft and those which are to be sucked and licked in great variety and quantity. Let her furnish me with manycoloured garlands of fresh flowers from trees, wines and other drinks and meat of different kinds. The valiant ascetic of incomparable lustre and power of penance in profound meditation said this in an accent in conformity with Vedic instruction. As Bharadwaja with folded palms was thus meditating with his face turned eastward, all the deities appeared there one by one. Meanwhile, soft auspicious and pleasant breeze passing over Malaya and Dardura mountains, comforting and cooling the sweat, began to blow. Then divine clouds rolled in and showered celestial flowers. The sounds of heavenly gongs could be heard in every direction. Gentle breeze began to blow. Troops of apsaras danced. Gandharvas and gods sang and the lyres rang. That soft, melodious, rhythmic and wellmodulated sound entered the heaven and earth as well as the ears of all living beings. When the celestial sounds pleasing to the ears of men had subsided, the army of Bharata beheld the wonderful creations of Visvakarma. The ground was levelled on every side for five yojanas and covered with several grass lawns resembling lapis lazuli (blue sapphire) and cat's eye. There the best of fruitbearing trees like bilva trees, woodapple trees, citrons, emblic myrobalan trees and mango trees laden with fruits sprang up. From the forests of the northern Kuru kingdom, with all delights of heaven, a divine river with innumerable trees that grow on river banks came into existence. Bright quadrangles, stables for elephants and horses, auspicious arch ways for palaces and mansions sprang up. An auspicious royal palace with splendid archs resembling white clouds sprang up. It was sprinkled with celestial perfumes and adorned with beautiful garlands. That royal palace forming a quadrangle was furnished with couches, seats and carriages and furnished with celestial drinks of every kind, delicious food and splendid garments. It was stocked with food of every variety in clean and spotless vessels. Seats for every one and magnificent couches covered with excellent bedstead were arranged.

That royal palace forming a quadrangle was furnished with couches, seats and carriages and furnished with celestial drinks of every kind, delicious food and splendid garments. It was stocked with food of every variety in clean and spotless vessels. Seats for every one and magnificent couches covered with excellent bedstead were arranged. Longarmed Bharata, son of Kaikeyi entered that palace full of jewels with the permission of the great sage. All the ministers, priests followed him and were glad to see the arrangement in that mansion. There where stood an exquisite throne, a fan and a parasol Bharata stayed in the company of ministers. He bowed in reverence and worshipped the throne (as though Rama were seated there). Taking hold of a fan made of yak's tail he sat in a minister's seat. First the ministers and priests took their respective seats in accordance with their rank, and then the army chief and finally the supervisor of the camp. Rivers filled with payasam (rice cooked in milk and sugar) in the shape of mud flowed towards Bharata at the command of Bharadwaja. On both the banks of those rivers, charming, celestial houses plastered with white clay appeared by the grace of Brahma. At that very moment twenty thousand women adorned with beautiful ornaments sent by Brahma presented themselves. Twenty thousand women adorned with gold, gems and corals sent by Kubera came. Troops of twenty thousand apsaras by whom any man when taken hold of in their arms could be intoxicated with intense passion, came from Nandana gardens. There along with Narada, Tumburu and Gopa, distinguished kings of the gandharvas, looking bright like the Sun, began to sing in the presence of Bharata. Thereafter, the apsaras, Alambusa, Misrakesi, Pundarika and Vamana danced near Bharata at the command of Bharadwaja. The garlands of the gods available in Chitraratha's (Kubera's) garden could not match those obtained under the orders of Bharadwaja. At the command of Bharadwaja, bilva trees acted as drummers, vibhitaka trees as cymbalists and the pipal trees as dancers. Thereafter pine, palmyra, tilaka, and naktamala trees were transformed into hunchbacks and dwarfs and moved about in great delight. Asohka, emblic myrobalan and all other trees found in the forest malati, mallika and jati creepers assumed the form of women, came over to the hermitage of Bharadwaja and said: 'O wine drinkers, drink as much as you can those who are hungry partake payasam and sacred meat'. 'O wine drinkers, drink as much as you can those who are hungry partake payasam and sacred meat'. Every single warrior was attended by seven or eight women who applied oil and massaged his body and bathed him on the lovely banks of the river. Some women with beautiful eyes quickly approached them for massaging. The  best of ladies wiped their bodies dry and gave each other wine to drink. The attendants of draughtanimals fed the horses, elephants, donkeys, camels and oxen their appropriate food. The draughtaimals of the illustrious warriors of Ikshvaku kings were urged by the highly energetic attendants to eat more and more of parched grain mixed with sugarcane and honey. The horserider no longer recognised the horse or the mahout the elephant and the whole army was inebriated with drinking and pleasure. All the armymen with their desires gratified and anointing their bodies with red sandal paste surrounded by apsaras exclaimed. We will neither return to Ayodhya, nor enter Dandaka (forest). May Bharata and Rama be happy. Having enjoyed the hospitality of Bharadwaja the foot soldiers, horse and elephant riders made utterances ignoring their leaders. The exceedingly delighted soldiers of Bharata's retinue in their thousands cried out with excitement This is the very heaven. Those thousands of soldiers wearing flower garlands ran about dancing, singing, and laughing. Glancing at the ambrosial food, a desire arose in the minds of those soldiers to eat once again although they had already partaken it. Messengers, maidservants, female attendants, and soldiers -- all of them in their thousands dressed in fresh garments felt exceedingly proud of themselves. There the elephants, donkeys and camels, cows and horses and also beasts and birds were wellnourished. No one troubled the other. In that army there was none who could be seen without wearing garments of sparkling white, who was hungry or dirty or with decayed hair. There the soldiers beheld in amazement thousands of iron containers decked with flags and flowers and filled with white rice, mutton, pork, choicest condiments, fruit juice, fragrant and tasty soup. There the soldiers beheld in amazement thousands of iron containers decked with flags and flowers and filled with white rice, mutton, pork, choicest condiments, fruit juice, fragrant and tasty soup. Along the edge of the forest, wells were filled with thick payasam. There were wishfulfilling cows and honeydripping trees. The wells were found filled with datepalm liquor and surrounded by pots of well cooked meat of peacocks, chicken and other animals. There were thousands of pots, lakhs of plates, crores of vessels -- all made of gold and filled with wellgarnished food. Curd was kept in earthern pots like jugs and jars and pots with a wide mouth. Tanks were formed, some filled with white curd of good flavour and of the colour of woodapple, some with white curd blended with spices and some with payasam and heaps of barely powder mixed with sugar.

The soldiers saw on the river banks at landing places levigated powder, fragrant powder and extracts and other bathing requisites of different kinds stored in receptacles. There the soldiers beheld on every side stacks of toothbrushing sticks, white and bristled, white lumps of sandal paste placed in dishes made of leaves, well cleaned mirrors, collection of clothes, several pairs of footwear, collyrium boxes, combs, brushes for cleaning moustaches, weapons, parasoles, bows and shining armour, different kinds of couches, and seats. There were pools of drinking water for donkeys, camels, elephants and horses and excellent landing places filled with flowering lotuses and water lilies. The lakes were of transparent waters resembling the hue of the sky easy and comfortable for swimming. There they saw heaps of soft grass as green as sapphire and kadamva trees for animals to refresh themselves under.

The men were amazed when they beheld the wonderful hospitality extended by maharshi Bharadwaja to Bharata, as if all this happened in a dream world. As they were enjoying themselves in Bharadwaja's hermitage like the gods in the garden of Indra the night wore off. Those rivers, the gandharvas and all those lovely women took leave of sage Bharadwaja and returned to where they had come from.",
                "Bharata with his retinue received the hospitality and spent the night at Bharadwaja's ashram. Then he approached Bharadwaja on his own. Seeing Bharata, the best among men, who stood with folded palms, sage Bharadwaja, who had just completed his firesacrifice, said to him: O sinless one hope, you spent the night at our hermitage well? Tell me whether all your people enjoyed the hospitality? Bharata saluted with folded palms the sage of great powers. And emerging from the hermitage, replied: O holy one, I with my ministers and the entire army of men and animals passed the night happily. All our desires have been gratified by you. All of us including the messengers were released from fatigue and heat. We were wellfed and wellhoused and the night was wellspent. O venerable one O excellent of the ascetics I seek your leave. As I am proceeding to see my brother, bless me with a kindly look. O knower of righteousness Tell me which path leads to the hermitage of that righteous and magnanimous one (Rama)? And how far is it (from here)? Thus questioned, the great sage, brilliant Bharadwaja replied to Bharata who was yearning to see his brother: O Bharata, three and a half yojanas from here in the lonely forest stands mount Chitrakuta, with its charming streams and woodlands On its northern side flows the river Mandakini which is densely covered with flowering trees and lovely blossoming woods (on its banks). O dear child, beyond that river lies mount Chitrakuta on which there is a hut made of leaves where, for sure, they both dwell. O distinguished lord of the army, if you lead your army full of elephants, horses and chariots through the southern path or towards the southwest, you will come across Rama there. When they heard about the journey, the wives of Dasaratha descended from their chariots worthy of them and stood around the brahmin, Bharadwaja. Among them was Kausalya, trembling, emaciated and desolate, along with Sumitra.  They grasped the feet of sage Bharadwaja with their hands. Kaikeyi with her unfulfilled desire and despised in all the worlds overcome with shame, also grasped his feet. She reverently circumambulated that great and divine ascetic and stood not far away from Bharata with a sad heart. Then Bharadwaja, firm in his vows, said to Bharata, I want to know about your mothers individually. Thus asked by the sagacious Bharadwaja, Bharata, proficient in speech, replied with palms folded in reverence: O venerable sage, this queen you are looking at, forlorn and emaciated due to grief and fasting, and who resembles a goddess is Kausalya, the principal queen of my father. As Aditi bore Dhata, she bore Rama, the best among men who walks with the powerful stride of a lion. O venerable sage, this queen you are looking at, forlorn and emaciated due to grief and fasting, and who resembles a goddess is Kausalya, the principal queen of my father. As Aditi bore Dhata, she bore Rama, the best among men who walks with the powerful stride of a lion. This lady plunged in grief, resembling the branch of a karnikara tree in the midst of the forest with blossoms withered and leaning on the left arm of Kausalya, is queen Sumitra, mother of two heroes, comparable to gods in beauty and possessing true prowess -- Lakshmana and Satrughna. This lady plunged in grief, resembling the branch of a karnikara tree in the midst of the forest with blossoms withered and leaning on the left arm of Kausalya, is queen Sumitra, mother of two heroes, comparable to gods in beauty and possessing true prowess -- Lakshmana and Satrughna. She is my mother Kaikeyi who is irascible, lacks the power of discrimination, proud, boastful of her beauty, ambitious of wealth, ignoble in the guise of a noble woman, wicked and intent on sinful acts. Behold her. You may know that because of her,  Rama and Lakshmana the best of men entered the forest which may cause their destruction and king Dasaratha attained heaven. She alone is the root of this great calamity that I am presently confronting.

Behold her. You may know that because of her,  Rama and Lakshmana the best of men entered the forest which may cause their destruction and king Dasaratha attained heaven. She alone is the root of this great calamity that I am presently confronting. Thus spoke Bharata, the best of men, with his eyes reddened and voice choked with sobs and  hissing like a king cobra. Hearing the words of Bharata, the great sage, wise Bharadwaja replied with meaningful words: O Bharata, you should not find fault with Kaikeyi. Rama's banishment will prove a great source of happiness in future (for mankind). Banishment of Rama will bring about the welfare of the gods, the demons, and the sages of purified souls. Having paid obeisance, the accomplished Bharata circumambulated sage Bharadwaja, look leave of him, and ordered his army to get ready. Different groups of people intending to depart harnessed excellent horsechariots decorated with gold. The male and female elephants wearing golden girths and decorated with pennants,  set forth with their bells sounding like thunderclouds at the end of summer. Various types of costly carriages, large and small, set forth, while the infantry marched on. The women headed by Kausalya, eager to see Rama, proceeded delightfully in distinguished carriages. Magnanimous Bharata got into an auspicious palanquin of the splendour of the Sun and the Moon kept ready and proceeded amidst escorts. That vast army teeming with elephants, horses and chariots proceeded southward spreading like a lofty cloud that had risen in the sky, traversing through the forests full of birds and beasts, passing through the mountains and streams on the other side of the river Ganga. That vast army teeming with elephants, horses and chariots proceeded southward spreading like a lofty cloud that had risen in the sky, traversing through the forests full of birds and beasts, passing through the mountains and streams on the other side of the river Ganga. Bharata's army of soldiers, elephants and horses, all in high spirits, looked splendid while entering the forest full of frightening flocks of birds and beasts.       Thus ends the ninetysecond sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On seeing the great army marching, the exited leaders of herds of elephants inhabiting the forest were frightened and ran off with their herds. Bears, herds of dappled gazelle and antelopes could be seen everywhere in the stretches of the forest, also on the mountains and on the river banks. Bharata the righteous son of Dasaratha, proceeded with great delight in the company of the clamouring army of four divisions. The army of the magnanimous Bharata, resembling the waves of the ocean, covered the earth as the clouds cover the sky during the rainy season. At that moment, a multiutde of swift horses and elephants spread out with great speed and the surface of the earth became invisible for a long time. With his draught animals extremely wearied by covering a great distance, the majestic Bharata said to Vasistha, the best of counsellors: Looking at these surroundings and from what I had heard, it is clear that we have reached the region indicated by Bharadwaja. This mountain is Chitrakuta and this river, Mandakini. The forest shines from a distance like a blue cloud. The enchanting ridges of mount Chitrakuta are now trampled by my mountainlike elephants. The trees on the mountain ridges are shedding flowers, like dense blue rainclouds showering water at the end of summer. O Satrughna, behold this mountain frequented by kinneras and abounding in animals like great crocodiles in the ocean. Incited by the clamour of the army, these swiftrunning herds of deer expelled from their retreats resemble mass of clouds in the autumnal sky shattered by the wind. Like the people of the south, the trees on the mountain ridges with branches, brilliant like clouds, are crowned with fragrant flowers as adornments. This forest, dreadful in appearance was devoid of twittering of birds. But now it appears to me like Ayodhya thronged with people. While the dust kicked by the hooves of the horses enveloped the forest, the wind, as if to please me, is quickly blowing them away. Behold, O Satrughna, these chariots, commanded by excellent charioteers,  harnessed with horses are flying through the forest. Behold, these lovely frightened peacocks and other birds hurriedly entering their nests. Being the abode of ascetics, this region looks very charming like the pathway to heaven. In this forest many a dappled deer with their mates looking as if painted with flowers are seen wandering about with a charming appearance. Let the soldiers set out and properly search the forest till such time the best of men, Rama and Lakshmana, are found. Hearing the words of Bharata, those valiant warriors with weapons in their hands entered the forest. Therafter, they observed a spiral of smoke rising. Having seen the column of smoke, they returned and informed Bharata, saying, 'In a place bereft of men, fire cannot exist. Clearly Rama and Lakshmana must be here only.' In case the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, the best of men, and subduers of enemies are not residing here then evidently it must be some other ascetics like Rama. Having heard these words acceptable to the pious, Bharata, the crusher of enemy forces, addressed the entire army: All of you carefully watch here. Do not proceed any further. Sumantra, the preceptor and myself shall go forward. At this command, all of them halted. Then Bharata fixed his gaze on the source of the smoke. The army thus halted by Bharata, gazing at the space before them rejoiced at the thought that not long before they would rejoin their beloved Rama.       Thus ends the ninetythird sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

Behold the captivating sporting retreats of Vidyadharis, with their swords and best garments hung on the branches of the trees. Behold a waterfall here and a fountain there gushing from the earth and in other places, the mountain looks like an elephant rutting ichor. The breeze from the caves carrying the fragrance of many flowers is satisfying the sense of smell. Who will not find it delightful? O flawless one, if I am to live here for many years to come with you and Lakshmana, no grief will consume me. O lovely Sita, I am enamoured of this delightful mountain with its enchanting peaks laden with abundance of flowers and fruits and flocked by different kinds of birds. By living in the forest I have achieved a twofold benefitdischarge of debt of my father with regard to righteousness and causing happiness to Bharata. O Sita, are you enjoying by being with me here on this Chitrakuta and observing various objects gratifying to the body, mind and speech? My greatgrandfathers and ancient royal sages used to say that living in the forest is like enjoying nectar for a king for the best existence after death. Several hundreds of massive rocks of the mountain look splendid all around, in  blueblack, yellow, white and red colours. Herbs in thousands on this king of the hills shine in the night with the splendour of  their own lustre, like flames of fire. O lovely Sita Some regions of the mountain look like dwellingplaces, some others are like flowergardens and some are shining like a single rock. This Chitrakuta mountain stands erect as if it has arisen by splitting open the earth and its peak looks graceful from every side. Behold those excellent couches of lovers spread with leaves of kustha, sthagara, punnaga and bhurja and covered with lotus petals. O Lady, behold those lotus garlands crushed and cast aside by lovers and also many fruits (tasted by them and) lying there. This Chitrakuta mountain, with abundance of roots, fruits and water surpasses in beauty Vasvaukasara, the capital city of Kubera or Nalini, his celestial garden or the land of Uttarakuru. O my beloved Sita, by spending time with you and Lakshmana following the path of the virtuous with utmost restraint and by enhancing the righteousness of my race, I shall obtain great felicity.       Thus ends the ninetyfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Rama, the lord of Kosala, descended from the mountain and showed Sita the charming river Mandakini of sacred waters. Lotus-eyed Rama said to the heavy-hipped daughter of the king of Videha, whose face resembled the beautiful Moon. Look at this enchanting river Mandakini with its variegated sandbanks frequented by geese and swans and adorned with lotuses. See this river sparkling with trees of every kind laden with fruits and flowers growing on its banks. Everywhere it resembles the lake Nalini of Kubera. The herds of deer have just drunk water by descending down the landing places and the waters are still turbid. This sight produces great pleasure in me. O my beloved rishis with matted locks and wearing deer skins and bark of trees as upper cloth bathe in the river Mandakini for performing morning ablutions in time. O largeeyed Sita, some other ascetics of rigid austerities worship the sungod according to tradition, lifting up their arms and invoking the Sun. With the trees whose tops are swayed by the wind, the mountain was as if dancing, shedding leaves and flowers all around the river. Behold this river Mandakini whose waters here are transparent like crystals, there sparkling with sand dunes and elsewhere crowded with siddhas. Look at the scattered heaps of flowers shaken off by the wind and large quantities of flowers floating on the waters. O my auspicious Sita, sweetvoiced Chakravaka birds singing in most pleasant tones are alighting on those heaps of flowers. My lovely Sita, I consider watching this mount Chitrakuta and river Mandakini in your presence more delightful than living in Ayodhya. The waters of river Mandakini is perpetually agitated by siddhas who are endowed with asceticism, selfrestraint and tranquillity and who are cleansed of sins by taking bath in the river. Plunge with me into this river. O lovely Sita, like a companion plunge into this river Mandakini, submerging the red and white lotuses, and enjoy sporting. O my lovely lady Always think this river Mandakini as Sarayu and this mount Chitrakuta as Ayodhya and these wild animals as its inhabitants. With righteous Lakshmana obedient and you, O Sita, agreeable to me, you both bring me great pleasure. Bathing thrice in your company at the time of prayers and partaking honey, roots and fruits, I do not yearn either for Ayodhya or for the kingdom. With this enchanting Mandakini teeming with herds of deer, whose waters are drunk by elephants, lions and monkeys, decorated with heaps of flowers fallen from the trees in full bloom, who will not feel happy and free from fatigue. Rama, the perpetuator of the Raghu dynasty, describing the river Mandakini at length appropriately in this manner, wandered in the company of his beloved consort on mount Chitrakuta looking black like collyrium.       Thus ends the ninetyfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama showed Sita, the princess of Mithila the river Mandakini flowing in the mountain, gratified her by offering meat (to eat) and sat on the mountain slope. Offering Sita several kinds of preparations to eat, righteous Rama, seated in her company remarked, This meat is savoury, this meat roasted on fire is sacred. Now as Rama was sitting there, the tumult and the dust raised by the approaching army of Bharata reached the sky. Meanwhile, the mighty leaders of the elephantherds were agitated, and frightened by the loud noise, fled away from there in different directions. Rama heard the sound generated by the army and saw those leaders of herds fleeing away. Seeing those animals fleeing and hearing the clamour, Rama addressed Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, who was blazing with energy. O Lakshmana, the worthy son of Sumitra, fearful and tumultuous clamour like rumbling sound of clouds is heard. What a wonder Go and see. Herds of elephants and buffaloes in the great woods and wild beasts frightened by lions are running in different directions. O Lakshmana, do ascertain if any king or prince has come for hunting or whether any ferocious animal has entered this forest, shouldn't you? O Lakshmana, this mountain is highly inaccessible even to birds. Find out exactly and quickly what this is all about. Lakshmana hurriedly climbed a flowering sala tree, surveyed in all directions and fixed his gaze on the east. Turning his face to the north, he beheld a vast army consisting of chariots, elephants and horses and a wellequipped infantry. He (Lakshmana) informed Rama about the army full of horses and elephants and decorated with chariotbanners and said these words: O noble one, put out the sacred fire (Agnihotra) and let Sita take refuge in the cave. String your bow and keep the arrows ready. Put on your armour. Rama the best among men replied to Lakshamana, Oh, Lakshmana, look properly and tell me to whom do you think this army might belong Hearing the words of Rama, enraged Lakshmana, like a flaming fire as if he would reduce the army to ashes, replied: It is evident that Kaikeyi's son Bharata, who has been consecrated, is coming to slay both of us desiring the prosperous kingdom (to be without obstacles). There on that chariot, is a banner shining brilliantly with the emblem of a lofty majestic Kovidara tree with a large trunk. There the emblem of the great Kovidara tree of very large trunk spread with many branches shines brilliantly atop the chariot. These men mounted on swiftlymoving horses are following the post. The riders of elephants  mounted on the elephants look cheerful. O mighty warrior, let both of us take up the bows and station ourselves on this mountain or we shall stay here itself armed with weapons fully prepared for the battle. O Rama, will this Kovidara emblem come into our possession in the battle? Can I see Bharata, the cause of the calamity that has befallen you, Sita and me? O that mighty warrior Bharata, on whose account you have been banished from the perpetual kingdom, comes here as a foe and as for me, he deserves to be slain. O Rama, I do not see anything  wrong in slaying Bharata. In killing one who had done harm is not an act of unrighteousness. O Rama, Bharata has abandoned righteousness and has harmed you. When he is slain, you shall rule over the whole earth. Let that Kaikeyi, greedy for the kingdom, see in great anguish her son who shall be slain by me today in a battle like a tree felled by an elephant. I shall also slay Kaikeyi with her attendants and relations. Let the earth be cleansed of the great sin today. O protector of honour, today I shall vent my suppressed anger and dishonour on the enemy's army like a fire on the thicket. Today I shall rend the bodies of enemies with my sharpened arrows and spatter the forest of Chitrakuta mountain with their blood. Let the wild beasts drag away the elephants, horses and men to be killed by me with their hearts transfixed with my arrows. Having slain Bharata and his army in this great forest, I shall doubtless discharge my debt to my arrows and bow.       Thus ends the ninetysixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, Rama pacified Lakshmana, son of Sumitra who was violently agitated. He said to him who had swooned with rage: When sagacious Bharata of great strength has come here, where is the need for a bow or a sword or a shield. O Lakshmana, having sworn that I would make father's word true, what shall I do with the kingdom earned slanderously by slaying Bharata who has come (to see me)? I shall never accept any wealth obtained by destroying kith and kin or friends which is akin to taking food prepared with poison. O Lakshmana, on the oath of righteousness, I wish wealth and pleasure as well as this kingdom for the sake of you all. O Lakshmana, I desire this kingdom only for the unity and happiness of my brothers. I swear on the weapon I hold. O gentle Lakshmana, lordship of this earth with the sea as its garment is not difficult to obtain (for me). But I do not desire even Indrahood by unrighteous means. O protector of honour even if there were to be some happiness which I could enjoy without you, Bharata, and Satrughna, let it be reduced to ashes by fire. O best among men, O valiant one I think Bharata who is affectionate towards his brothers and who is dearer to me than my life, must have returned to Ayodhya and has heard that I had been exiled along with you and Janaki, wearing barks and matted locks. Remembering the duties of the race with an afflicted mind and with agitated senses he has come here to see me. He has not come with any other intention. O best among men, O valiant one I think Bharata who is affectionate towards his brothers and who is dearer to me than my life, must have returned to Ayodhya and has heard that I had been exiled along with you and Janaki, wearing barks and matted locks. Remembering the duties of the race with an afflicted mind and with agitated senses he has come here to see me. He has not come with any other intention. O best among men, O valiant one I think Bharata who is affectionate towards his brothers and who is dearer to me than my life, must have returned to Ayodhya and has heard that I had been exiled along with you and Janaki, wearing barks and matted locks. Remembering the duties of the race with an afflicted mind and with agitated senses he has come here to see me. He has not come with any other intention. Auspicious Bharata, angry with Kaikeyi and having spoken to her unpleasant, bitter words and having propitiated our father, has come here to offer me the kingdom. Finding the time appropriate, Bharata has come to see us. Even in his mind he would have never thought of causing any harm to us in any way. Why are you suspicious of Bharata? Has he done anything disagreeable to you any time in the past? You must not speak any harsh or unpleasant words against Bharata. If you do, they will be deemed to be directed against me. Whatever be the calamity, O Lakshmana, how will sons slay their father, or a brother kill his own brother who is as dear to him as his own life? If you are saying all these words only for the sake of the kingdom, then I shall ask Bharata when I see him to offer this kingdom to you. O Lakshmana if I earnestly exhort Bharata to offer this kingdom to you, then on hearing those words, he would say, 'Certainly so'. Having heard the words uttered by his brother, Rama of virtuous disposition, Lakshmana who was devoted to his brother's welfare, shrank. Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana was abashed and said I think it is our father, king Dasaratha who has come here personally to see you. Observing Lakshmana's abashment, Rama said I think the mightyarmed king Dasaratha has come to see all of us here. Or rather having thought of the adversities of dwelling in a forest and also by realising  that both of us are accustomed to comforts, I think he has certainly come to take us back home. Our father, the prosperous Dasaratha, after withdrawing this princess Vaidehi who is brought up in luxury from the forest (to Ayodhya), will return. O valiant warrior, you can see those two splendid horses of high pedigree, charming, swift and equal to wind in speed are shining (in the army). There is that huge and aged elephant named Satrunjaya which belogns to our sagacious father proceeding at the head of the army. I do not see, O long-armed one! that splendid white canopy of my father, well-respected by men. And this gives rise to doubts in my mind. Get off the treetop, O Lakshmana, and do what I say said the righteous Rama. Lakshmana, the conqueror of foes, descended from the top of the sala tree and stood by the side of Rama with folded palms. Let not the hermitage be crowded commanded Bharata, and the army encamped  around the mountain. Bharata's army full of horses, elephants and chariots covering a distance of more than one and a half yojanas encamped by the side of the mountain. The army brought by Bharata, the great moralist, was shining around Chitrakuta mountain following dharma, and casting off all pride, in order to please Rama.       Thus ends the ninetyseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On encamping the army, lord Bharata, the best among men, wished to approach on foot Rama who was devoted to his father. After the army encamped in the assigned places, Bharata said to his brother Satrughna thus: O dear Satrughna, you should explore this forest quickly along with groups of our people and  hunters as well. Let Guha, surrounded by a thousand kinsmen and armed with bows, arrows and swords look for Rama. 'I myself shall go on foot surrounded by ministers, citizens, preceptors and brahmins and search the entire forest. 'I shall not rest in peace until I see Rama, powerful Lakshmana and illustrious princess of Videha (Sita). I shall not attain peace until I see my brother, Rama whose auspicious countenance looks radiant as the Moon and whose eyes as lotuspetals. Peace shall not come to me until I hold on my head the feet of my brother, the insignia of royalty. I shall not attain peace until Rama, who is worthy of this kingdom, is sprinkled with the holy water of coronation and assumes the ancestral kingdom. Lakshmana, one who beholds the highly effulgent countenance of Rama, resembling the spotless Moon and whose eyes resemble red lotuses, is blessed indeed Sita, the illustrious daughter of Janaka and princess of Videha, has accomplished her purpose by following Rama, the lord of this earth bounded by the ocean. Like Kubera in the Nandana garden, Rama lives here on mount Chitrakuta which is indeed blessed like the Himalaya, king of the mountains. Fortunate is this inaccessible forest which is inhabited by wild animals to have become the dwelling place of the most radiant Rama, the foremost among the wielders of weapons. Having said thus, the best of men, mightyarmed and highly energetic Bharata entered the great forest on foot. Bharata, the best among the eloquent, made his way amidst multitude of trees grown on mountain slopes with their tops in full bloom. Having reached a flowering sala tree atop Chitrakuta mountain, he beheld a lofty banner of smoke rising from the fire burning in Rama's hermitage. On seeing the smoke, majestic Bharata in the company of relatives concluded that Rama was staying there and rejoiced like a man who had reached the other bank of the river. Having heard of Rama's hermitage on the Chitrakuta mountain inhabited by pious men, magnanimous Bharata, commanded his army to stay at a distance, and quickly proceeded with Guha.       Thus ends the ninetyeighth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Eager to see his brother, Bharata encamped the army and set out showing the hermitage to Satrughna. Bharata, deeply devoted towards elders, indicated to sage Vasistha to bring along the mothers, and  proceeded ahead quickly. Sumantra, who was overeager, like Bharata, to see Rama, followed Satrughna who was not far from him. While walking, Bharata beheld a hut made of leaves looking like a hermit's cottage. In front of that hut Bharata beheld shattered logs of wood and also flowers plucked. Bharata beheld here and there knots of kusa grass and strips of bark tied on trees as signs to ascertain the way to the hermitage of Rama and Lakshmana. He also beheld large heaps of dried cakes of dung of buffaloes and deer for use against cold in the forest. Walking on, the longarmed, effulgent and delighted Bharata said to Satrughna and the ministers surrounding him: We must have reached the region about which Bharadwaja had spoken. I think river Mandakini is not far from here. Here are long bark garments fastened on lofty places as marks of identification left by Lakshmana, to locate the path at odd times which may be needed while going out. This must be the place on the hillside on which mighty tuskers wander about trumpeting and charging at one another. Here is the thick smoke emanating from the blacktrailed fire maintained perpetually by the ascetics living in the forest. I shall see here with a delighted heart the venerable Rama, the best of men, who renders great hospitality (to elders) and who resembles a maharshi. Bharata walked for a short distance towards mount Chitrkuta when he reached river Mandakini. And then said to his ministers: Rama, the lord of men, a tiger among men, is sitting on the ground in a 'heroic' (yogic) posture in this secluded forest. O fie upon my birth and my life Effulgent Rama, the lord of the world, had to renounce all desires and undergo this calamity of living in the forest on my account. Reviled by the world, I shall now fall at the feet of Sita, Rama and Lakshmana seeking their grace. Lamenting in this way Bharata beheld in that forest an excellent, sacred and enchanting hut covered with a lot of leaves of sala, palmyra and aswakarna trees like a sacrificial altar spread with soft kusa grass. Goldplated bows that resembled the thunderbolt of Indra, powerful and capable of achieving great targets and oppressing the enemies, adorned the hut. Arrows glittering like the rays of the Sun, were dreadful, with blazing heads and stored in quivers adorned it like the hooded serpents illumining the city of Bhogavati (in the nether world). A pair of swords in scabbards made of excellent silver, two shields of different colours with golden spots, fingerguards made of skin of iguana decorated with gold were hanging there. It was impregnable to enemy hordes like the cave of a lion to the deer.

It was impregnable to enemy hordes like the cave of a lion to the deer. Bharata beheld at Rama's residence a sacred and spacious altar sloping to the northeast, with a burning fire upon it. Bharata looked around for a moment and saw his esteemed brother Rama seated in that thatched cottage wearing matted locks of hair. He saw Rama, lord of the oceanbound earth, seated like blazing fire, clad in antelope skin and garment of bark, with long arms and shoulders like a lion and eyes like white lotuses. The mightyarmed warrior seemed like Brahma, the creator and the eternal, protector of righteousness. Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana Rama sat on the bare ground strewn with darbha grass. He saw Rama, lord of the oceanbound earth, seated like blazing fire, clad in antelope skin and garment of bark, with long arms and shoulders like a lion and eyes like white lotuses.

The mightyarmed warrior seemed like Brahma, the creator and the eternal, protector of righteousness. Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana Rama sat on the bare ground strewn with darbha grass. Beholding Rama, Bharata the majestic and righteous son of Kaikeyi overwhelmed with grief and distress rushed towards him. On seeing Rama, Bharata could not control his grief with patience and lamented in great anguish and with words choked with tears said: My elder brother who deserves to be attended by ministers and other subjects in the royal assembly sits here today in the forest surrounded by wild beasts. Such magnanimous Rama, a follower of dharma, accustomed to be attired in  thousands of dresses in the past now clad in two deer skins, is practising righteousness. How is it that Rama who used to wear variegated flowers formerly, now bears these heavy matted locks? That Rama, who in accordance with tradition deserves accredition of religious merit through sacrifices now seeks it through mortification of body. How is it that the body of my venerable brother which was once smeared with expensive, fragrant sandal paste is now covered with dust? It is on my account that Rama who was accustomed to all comforts has fallen into this misfortune. Fie on my life of cruelty which is condemned by the world. Thus Bharata lamented in misery and with his lotuslike countenanace sweating  before reaching Rama's feet fell down, crying in distress. Mighty prince Bharata, oppressed with grief, could only say, O Arya (venerable one) And in distress could not speak any more. As he beheld the glorious Rama, with his throat choken with tears, he cried out, O Arya (venerable one) and thereafter, was unable to speak any more. Satrughna also prostrated himself at the feet of tearful Rama who embraced both of them. Thereafter, princes Rama and Lakshmana joined Sumantra and Guha in the forest like the Sun and the Moon meeting the planets Sukra and Brihaspati in the sky. On seeing the princes now assembled in the great forest like mighty leaders of elephant herds, inhabitants of the forest had nothing but tears of grief, not joy, to shed.       Thus ends the ninetyninth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama beheld Bharata with matted locks and robes of bark fallen down on the ground with folded hands like the Sun at the time of dissolution of the world. It was really difficult to look at him. Rama found it extremely difficult to recognise Bharata with his emaciated body and pallid face. He held him in his arms and lifted him. Born in the race of Raghu, Rama embraced Bharata and kissed him on his forehead. Placing him on his lap, he enquired thus with a composed mind: O dear, now that you have come to the forest, where is our father king Dasaratha? You ought not come to the forest while he is living. You have come a long distance (from Ayodhya) to this forest, O Bharata It is a pity,  dear brother, to see you after a long time, so emaciated. What brings you to the forest? My dear (brother), now that you have come here, I trust, king Dasaratha is keeping good health and hope, he has not departed prematurely in despondency for the other world. O gentle one, being young and inexperienced, I trust, you have not forfeited the kingdom for ever. Dear child, I trust, you are looking after father whose prowess is his truthfulness. I trust king Dasaratha, who is true to his promise, a performer of Rajasuya and Ashwamedha sacrifices and a firm adherent of righteousness is in good health. O dear child I trust, the family preceptor of the Ikshvakus, Vasistha, the brahmin (versed in the Vedas), who is learned, ever fixed in virtues and effulgent is being honoured as usual. Dear child I trust, Kausalya and Sumitra, mothers of an excellent progeny are happy. I trust, the noble queen Kaikeyi is happy too. I trust, you continue to honour the family priest (Suyajna, son of Vasistha) who is endowed with modesty, born of high family, conversant in scriptures, free from envy and who can give you directions with regard to your duties. I trust, the sagacious priest who knows ritual precepts, who is upright and is employed to take care of your sacred fires, informs you always regarding what was offered and what is to be offered as oblation at appropriate time. Dear brother, I trust you continue to pay homage to gods, father, mothers, teachers, relations equal to your father, aged people, physicians and brahmins. I hope you treat with respect Sudhanva who is equipped with the most formidable arrows and other weapons propelled by mantras and a master in the science of statecraft. I hope, dear brother, you have appointed men who are brave, learned, selfcontrolled, of noble birth and skilled in guessing from hints. O Bharata the wellguarded advice of ministers, learned in scriptures and capable of proper counselling, is the root of victory for kings, specially when the advice is kept in confidence. I trust you are not under the grip of sleep but wake up at appropriate times, I hope you always think of the means of judicious statecraft during the last part of the night. I hope you neither decide alone nor discuss with many. I trust a decision once made by you is not leaked in the kingdom. O Bharata, having determined on an endeavour involving a little effort and yielding great results, I trust you commence to execute it quickly without procrastination? I trust, other kings come to know of your endeavours only when your endeavours suceed or about to succeed. I hope, efforts intended to be made in future are not revealed to them beforehand. Dear brother, I hope others are not able to understand your determination or those of your ministers, either by conjecture or by inference or through other means without being revealed either by you or by your ministers. I hope by setting aside a thousand fools, you prefer a single wise man. A wise man will be of immense help in difficult situations. Even if the king seeks the assistance from thousands or tens of thousands of fools, they cannot render any help to him. A single clearsighted minister who is prudent, brave and skilful can bring about great prosperity to a king or a prince. I hope you have employed highly competent servants for important tasks, mediocre servants in mediocre tasks and low people in inferior tasks. I hope you are assigning ministers, who are unyielding to bribery and other temptations, holding positions hereditarily and who are full of integrity and eminence, with superior tasks. Are not the citizens of your kingdom agitated at severe punishment meted out to them reproaching your ministers? Just like a performer of sacrifice scorns at an outcaste or a woman scorns at a lustful lover, do the subjects not scorn you for collecting taxes more than what is due? A learned person but skilled in contrivances, a warrior with passion for wealth and a man ever engaged in corrupting the minds of servants must be slain. A king who does not kill them is himself killed in due course. I trust you have appointed a man who is cheerful, brave, sagacious, steadfast, honest, of a good family, loyal and efficient as the army chief. I trust you honour and respect those prominent soldiers who are courageous, powerful, skilled in war and who have proven heroic exploits. I trust you distribute rations and wages to your army in due time without making delay. It has been mentioned in the scriptures that if provisions and wages are not paid in stipulated time, the dependent attendants will be incensed with their masters and will turn hostile and become corrupt, leading to great calamity. I hope all men of a good family, especially those who belong to our race, are loyal to you and are ready to sacrifice their lives for your cause. O Bharata, I hope you have chosen as your envoy an expert born in your own country, wellinformed, skilful and quick to understand one who repeats and reports (exactly) what has been told. I hope you collect information (of their secret efforts) intelligently through unrecognisable spies with three of them closely watching each of the eighteen officials (there are eighteen categories of officials in a kingdom) of the enemy's side and fifteen (officials) on your side. O slayer of foes, I hope you are always alert about your foes who were defeated by you and have come back. You should not ignore your enemies thinking they are weak. Dear brother, I hope you do not serve those brahmins who are atheists, who foolishly think of this world alone and fancy themselves as learned. They only bring disasters. While principal scriptures do exist, these superficial fellows take resort to the science of logic based on abstract reasoning, and indulge in futile talks. My dear brother I trust you are protecting the (impregnable) city of Ayodhya worthy of its name, formerly defended by our heroic ancestors, with its sturdy gates, its elephants, horses and chariots, its thousands of venerable, selfcontrolled and highly energetic brahmins, kshatriyas and vaisyas engaged in their respective professions, filled with palaces of various kinds, abounding in learned people and a prosperous city where everything is available in abundance.

O Bharata, my country which is marked with hundreds of sanctuaries near villages where life of the people is made comfortable, where there are shrines, water distribution facilities and tanks, which is wellploughed and rich in cattlewealth, free from violence and independent of rain.

It is enchanting. It is safe from wild animals. With fears expelled, free from sinful people, adorned with mines and wellprotected by my ancestors, it is prosperous and I hope people are living comfortably. I trust all those men who live on agriculture and cattlerearing are favourable to you. The world's prosperity, dear brother, grows on the profession of cattle rearing. I trust you nourish them and also afford portection and prevent adversities. A king must protect all those people living in his country in accordanc with righteousness. I trust, you keep the women pacified and wellprotected, you do not believe their words and do not divulge any secrets to them. I trust, you protect the habitat of elephants and you have a large number of milch cows. I trust you are not contented with the existing number of female and male elephants and horses. O prince, I trust, you rise early daily and present yourself welladomed to the people on the thoroughfare. All the servants, I trust, do not present themselves to you directly. At the same time they do not remain out of sight with fear at a distance. The middle course is the best way for the welfare of every one. Hope all the forts are adequately provided with wealth, foodgrains, weapons and water, with machines of war and craftsmen and archers. O Bharata, I trust, your revenues are abundant and expenditure much less. I trust you do not give away your treasure to undeserving persons. I trust, you are spending only on gods, ancestors, brahmins, guests, warriors and hosts of friends. I trust a man who is honest, purehearted and venerable, falsely accused of adultery is not slain out of avarice without consulting experts in scriptures. O best among men I trust that a thief, caught redhanded and interrogated and has sufficient proof is not set free, out of greed for money. O Bharata, I trust that your ministers are wellinformed and look into all matters in times of hardship pertaining to whether a man is rich or poor without any bias to either. O Bharata, the tears falling from the eyes of persons, who are falsely accused and punished for the pleasure of the king will destroy his progeny and cattle as well. O Bharata, I trust you wish to thrive by treating the old, children and foremost of learned people with the three expedients namely gifts, affection and kind words. I trust you pay homage to the preceptors, the aged ones, ascetics, gods and guests, to shrines and to accomplished brahmins. I trust, righteousness for the sake of prosperity or prosperity for the sake of righteousness or both for the sake of sensual pleasure are not thwarted by you. O Bharata, the best among the victorious, conversant with timely actions and a bestower of boons you are the best of men. I trust, you allocate adequate time for attending to all the three expedients of life like dharma, artha and kama. O highly sagacious Bharata, those brahmins who can comprehend the meaning of all scriptures along with the inhabitants of the city and country, I trust, are seeking your happiness. I trust you eschew the fourteen faults of kings, like atheism, falsehood, anger, inattention, procrastination, evading the wise, indolence, gratification of all five senses, planning alone in the affairs of the kingdom, consultation with people who are proficient in worthless acts, failure to implement decisious, inability to keep the counsel secret and omission of auspicious practices and setting out against all the enemies at a time.

I trust, the Vedas you have studied are fruitful, the acts which you commenced are productive, your wife is fruitful (blessed with a son) and the scriptures you studied are useful. O Bharata, I trust your intellect is in conformity with what I said conducive to long life, and fame in accordance with righteousness, (legitimate) pleasure and prosperity. I trust, you walk the auspicious path of truth (virtue) followed by our father and forefathers. O Bharata, I trust you do not partake delicious food all by yourself, and you share it with your friends when they want it. The highly sagacious and learned king, having acquired the entire earth and punishing the people in accordance with tradition and righteously ruling the kingdom, will ascend the his release (from this world).       Thus ends the hundredth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On listening to Rama, Bharata replied Of what use shall be these royal duties to me, when I have fallen from righteousness? O best of men there is an ancient tradition in our race that the younger son cannot become king when the eldest is there. Therefore, O scion of the Raghu race, return along with me to prosperous Ayodhya and for the good of our race get your self coronated. Other think the king to be a human, but to me, he is divine since his conduct and the statecraft are superhuman as they are in conformity with righteousness. While I was in Kekaya and you took refuge in the forest, venerable king (Dasaratha), who was always engaged in sacrifices and was held in high esteem by the virtuous, ascended to heaven. As soon as you set out for the forest along with Sita and Lakshmana, the king, overwhelmed with grief, attained heaven. Arise, O best of men and offer libations to our father. I and Satrughna have already done so. O son of Raghu's race, it is said that whatever is offered by a dear son becomes eternal in the world of manes. You alone are the beloved son of our father. Your father, deprived of you, brooding over you, wishing to behold you, unable to divert his mind fixed on you, remembering you alone and immersed in sorrow departed (from this world).         Thus ends the hundredone sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard the words of Bharata regarding the death of his father, Rama became unconscious. On hearing the thunderlike words spoken by Bharata afflicting the mind, like the thunderbolt hurled by Indra (enemy of demons) in a battle, Rama, the scorcher of enemies, stretching forth both his arms, fell down on the ground like a tree with flowering tops severed by an axe in the forest. On hearing the thunderlike words spoken by Bharata afflicting the mind, like the thunderbolt hurled by Indra (enemy of demons) in a battle, Rama, the scorcher of enemies, stretching forth both his arms, fell down on the ground like a tree with flowering tops severed by an axe in the forest. On hearing the thunderlike words spoken by Bharata afflicting the mind, like the thunderbolt hurled by Indra (enemy of demons) in a battle, Rama, the scorcher of enemies, stretching forth both his arms, fell down on the ground like a tree with flowering tops severed by an axe in the forest. Those brothers on all sides, with Sita lamenting, sprinkled water on Rama, the great archer and lord of the earth who, afflicted with grief, had fallen down on the ground, and was lying like an elephant exhausted from repeatedly striking a river bank. On regaining consciousness, shedding tears profusely, Rama again started speaking piteously. On hearing that his father, king Dasaratha, the lord of the world had attained heaven, righteous Rama said to Bharata in conformty with his rightful conduct. What shall I do in Ayodhya now that my father has followed the path ordained by the gods? Who will rule that Ayodhya deprived of that best of kings? I could not even perform the last rites of that magnanimous one who died of grief on account of me. What use is my life with an unlucky birth? O irreproachable Bharata, it is gratifying that you and Satrughna are indeed fortunate to have fulfilled your cherished desire since the king was wellhonoured by you with all the obsequial rites. Even after the completion of my exile I do not wish to return to Ayodhya which is directionless, bereft of its chief, the king. O subduer of enemies, when father has gone to the other world, who will guide me in Ayodhya after I complete my term of exile? On seeing my good conduct our father used to say comforting words to me. Now from whom can I hear such words pleasing to the ears? Having thus spoken to Bharata, Rama, overwhelmed with grief, approached his wife Sita whose face looked like the full Moon, and said to her. O Sita, your fatherinlaw is dead. O Lakshmana, you are deprived of your father. Bharata is relating to me the sad news that king Dasaratha has attained his heavenly abode. While the scion of the Kakutsthas was saying thus, copious tears welled up from the eyes of all those illustrious sons of Dasaratha. All the brothers, having consoled Rama as best they could, told him, Let the libations be offered to our father, the protector of the world. On hearing that her fatherinlaw, king Dasaratha, had attained heaven, Sita, her eyes filled with tears could not look at her husband in the face. Having consoled Sita, daughter of Janaka, griefstricken Rama said to Lakshmana who was also distressed with grief. I shall go and offer libations to my magnanimous father. Go and fetch the dried pulp of ingudi fruit and an upper garment made of bark. Let us proceed in this order -- you first, Sita second and I last. This procession  in mourning is terrible indeed. Thereafter, their constant follower Sumantra who was conversant in spiritual knowledge, a highminded person, softnatured, selfcontrolled, tranquilminded and staunchly devoted to Rama consoled him. Holding the hands of the princes, Sumantra helped their descent into the auspicious river Mandakini for taking bath. Thereafter, their constant follower Sumantra who was conversant in spiritual knowledge, a highminded person, softnatured, selfcontrolled, tranquilminded and staunchly devoted to Rama consoled him. Holding the hands of the princes, Sumantra helped their descent into the auspicious river Mandakini for taking bath. The illustrious brothers approached with great difficulty the swiftflowing and enchanting river Mandakini which had convenient descent and endowed with forests always in bloom. They descended at an auspicious place that was not slushy and offered libations of water saying 'O father, let these offerings be yours'. The illustrious brothers approached with great difficulty the swiftflowing and enchanting river Mandakini which had convenient descent and endowed with forests always in bloom. They descended at an auspicious place that was not slushy and offered libations of water saying 'O father, let these offerings be yours'. Rama, the ruler of the earth, held water with both palms cupped and, facing the south, the direction of Yama (the god of death) said these words, sobbing: 'O best of kings, you are gone to the world of the manes, and let this inexhaustible libation of pure water reach you'. Then, the powerful scion of the Raghu race reached bank, from the bathing spot of the river Mandakini along with his brothers and offered pinda (an offering of rice flour to the departed) to his late lamented father. Placing the balls of ingudi pulp mixed with badari fruit on a spread of darbha grass, Rama, was overcome with grief and weeping, said: O great king, we offer you such food as we partake now. Be pleased to accept it. For,  his gods are offered the food a man takes. Rama, the tiger among men, ascending the riverbank and proceeding on the same path (he had come), climbed the (Chitrakuta) mountain of charming slopes. Rama, lord of the earth, reached the door of the leafhut and took Bharata and Lakshmana in his arms. The mountain echoed with the sound of lamentations of all the brothers along with Sita which resembled the roar of lions. The soldiers of Bharata were alarmed on hearing the tumultuous sounds raised by those mighty brothers offering libations of water and lamenting. They said, 'Bharata must have joined Rama. That loud noise must be their wailing over their deceased father'. Then all of them left their camps with one single thought (of seeing Rama) in their minds and ran in the direction from where that sound emanated. Some rode horses, some, elephants, while others mounted welldecorated chariots, while the young went on foot. The whole multitude of people at once rushed towards the hermitage wishing to see Rama as if he had left long ago though he had gone on exile very recently. Eager to see the union of brothers, all those people went by every sort of vehicle filled with the sounds of hooves and wheels. The earth crushed by several vehicles, hooves (of horses) and wheels (of chariots) emitted tumultuous sounds like the sky in the gathering stormclouds. Frightened by the sound, the elephants followed by their females, spreading all the way the odour of the ichor, moved to other forests. Hearing that sound, hosts of boars and deer, buffaloes, serpents and apes, tigers, antelopes with ears like the cows', gavayas as well as dappled antelopes were all frightened. Ducks, watercranes, geese, karandavas, cranes, male cuckoos and kraunchas fled senselessly in different directions. The sky was filled with birds frightened by the sound and the earth covered with people. Both looked extremely beautiful. All at once the people saw the illustrious Rama, the best of men, and the subduer of enemies squatting on the bare earth. All those men with faces full of tears, reproaching Kaikeyi and Manthara (all the way), approached Rama. Thereafter, beholding those people deeply afflicted, their eyes full of tears, Rama embraced them as if they were his own father and mother. Rama embraced some, while others paid him obeisance. Therafter, he honoured his erstwhile companions and relations in accordance with their status. The weeping and the tumult of those magnanimous people made the earth, sky, mountaincaves and all quarters reverberate incessantly like the beating of drums.       Thus ends the hundred and second sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Longing to see Rama, Vasistha, headed by the wives of Dasaratha, set out on foot (where Rama was offering libations). The wives of the king while proceeding slowly towards the river Mandakini beheld the bathing place frequented by Rama and Lakshmana. Kausalya, with eyes filled with tears and her face emaciated, addressing Sumitra and the other wives of the king sadly said: This is a sacred place to the east of the forest used by the unfortunate Rama, and Lakshmana of untiring energy and Sita expelled from the country and undergoing suffering. O Sumitra, your son Lakshmana, free from laziness, always carries water from here for the sake of my son. Your son, though engaged in servile tasks (like bringing water), is not to be held contemptible because all the services intended for the benefit of his brother are prompted by virtue. This your son unaccustomed to, and undeserving of, any suffering may now give up this mean and distressing duty entrusted to him. That largeeyed Kausalya beheld the cakes of ingudi pulp placed by Rama for his father on a spread of darbha grass whose blades pointed toward the south. Seeing the pinda (edible offering made to the departed soul) placed on the ground for his father by the distressed Rama, queen Kausalya, addressing all the wives of Dasaratha, said: Have darsan of this pinda offered by Rama according to tradition to his magnanimous father, Dasaratha, lord of the Ikshvaku race. I do not think that this is an appropriate food for that godlike and great lord of the earth who enjoyed all luxury. How can Indralike Dasaratha, having ruled the earth bounded by four oceans, eat a cake of ingudi pulp? Rama (who was once) highly prosperous, had to offer the cake of ingudi pulp to his father. Nothing appears more painful to me than this in this world. Seeing the offering of cake of ingudi pulp by Rama to his father, how is it that my heart does not break into a thousand pieces in sorrow? The wellknown saying in this world is that 'whatever food a man partakes, his gods also partake the same'. This dictum appears true (now). The cowives, having thus consoled the distressed Kausalya, went to the hermitage. There they beheld Rama who looked like a god dislodged from heaven. Beholding Rama devoid of all luxury, his mothers afflicted with grief, and overcome with sorrow, cried aloud, tears streaming down. Rama, the best among men and true to his promise, rose and touched the auspicious feet of all his mothers (in reverence). Those largeeyed queens, their palms with delicate fingers and with auspicious hands with a pleasant touch, wiped the dust from the back of his body. On seeing his mothers, Lakshmana, too, was overcome with grief and with devotion followed Rama and slowly bowed to them with reverence. All the queens treated Lakshmana, born of Dasaratha and endowed with auspicious qualities, with the same love as they did to Rama. Sita, too, overcome with grief, grasped the feet of her mothersinlaw and stood before them, her eyes full of tears. Like a mother to her daughter, Kausalya embraced the wretched Sita, who was afflicted with sorrow, and emaciated due to her stay in the forest, and said to her: How is it that Sita, daughter of Janaka, king of Videha, daughterinlaw of Dasaratha and wife of Rama, has to undergo such hardships in the lonely forest. O Sita, after looking at your countenance, which is like a lotus, scorched by the sunshine, or like a withered waterlily or gold defiled by dust or the Moon obscured by the clouds, the fire of sorrow is burning my mind. The grief in my mind is like fire kindled from the arani (sacrificial faggots) that consumes its own souree. (On a circular wood piece, a wooden stick is placed and churned to produce fire specially in sacrifices is called arani.) O Sita, after looking at your countenance, which is like a lotus, scorched by the sunshine, or like a withered waterlily or gold defiled by dust or the Moon obscured by the clouds, the fire of sorrow is burning my mind. The grief in my mind is like fire kindled from the arani (sacrificial faggots) that consumes its own souree. (On a circular wood piece, a wooden stick is placed and churned to produce fire specially in sacrifices is called arani.) While Rama's mother was uttering such words in anguish, Rama reached Vasistha and clasped his feet with reverence. Rama touched the feet of the family priest Vasistha, a man equivalent to effulgent fire like Indra, the lord of the gods, does to Brihaspati and sat down along with him. After Vasistha and Rama sat down, righteous Bharata sat close to his elder brother. Behind him sat his companions, leading citizens, soldiers and righteous men. Beholding Rama attired like an ascetic but radiant with a majestic glow, the extremely valiant Bharata sat near him with folded palms like the great Indra purified by religious austerities sits near Brahma, the creator. All noble people were truly filled with great curiosity as to what Bharata was going to speak, after paying his homage and honouring Rama. Rama who was steadfast in truth, Lakshmana of great dignity and righteous Bharata surrounded by their friends were as resplendent as three sacrificial fires encircled by officiating priests.       Thus ends the one hundredthird sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama with his brother Lakshmana having consoled Bharata who is ever devoted to elders began to question: I want to hear what brought you to this region with your barkrobes, matted locks and antelope skin. What made you come to this region, leaving the kingdom and wearing deer skin and matted hair? You should tell me everything. Thus enquired by the magnanimous Rama, Bharata, joining his palms tightly, replied: O my revered sire our mighty father, having performed an impossible task of banishing you to the forest, and tortured by grief due to separation from his son, went to heaven. O Rama, tormentor of enemies having been instigated by a woman, my mother Kaikeyi, committed this great sin of destroying his (Dasaratha's) reputation. My mother, formented with grief and with the fruit of the kingdom forfeited, and cursed with widowhood, will fall into the dreadful hell. It behoves you to grant  me a favour. I am like your servant. Now get yourself coronated in the kingdom like Indra. All these subjects and your widowed mothers have come to you. It behoves you to grant them this favour. O bestower of honour by the law of primogeniture and as a worthy successor it is appropriate that you should accept the kingdom righteously and fulfil the desire of your friends. Like an autumnal night with the immaculate Moon, let this entire earth cease to be a widow by securing you as her lord. With my head bowed down, I beseech you along with all these ministers to show favour to me who is your brother, disciple and slave. O best among men, it does not behove you to transgress the prayers of the whole order of subjects and ministers to assume this hereditary and perpetual order. Having said thus, the mightyarmed Bharata, in accordance with tradition, grasped with tearful eyes the feet of Rama again with his head. Rama embraced his brother Bharata who repeatedly heaved sighs and resembled an elephant in rut, and said: How can a man like you, born of a noble race, endowed with energy, powerful and adherent to vows, commit a sin for the sake of a kingdom? O destroyer of enemies, I do not find even slightest fault with you. Like a child, it does not behove you to reproach your mother. O sagacious and sinless one, it is laid down (in sastras) that elders when married can always act at their free will towards their wives and sons. O handsome one, you should treat us the way the virtuous treat their wives, sons and disciples in this world. O handsome one, king Dasaratha is alone competent to accommodate me in the forest wearing bark robes and antelope skin as garment or install me in the kingdom. O best among the protectors of righteousness the honour shown to our father who is conversant with the ways of righteousness and much revered by the world ought to be shown towards our mother also. O Bharata, I have been commanded by our righteous father and mother to go to the forest. How can any one act otherwise? You shall rule the kingdom wellhonoured by the people in Ayodhya and I shall live in Dandaka forest wearing bark as garments. The maharja of great radiance made this division in the presence of people and after commanding thus, ascended heaven. The proclamation of that righteous king revered by the world shall be your guide. You should enjoy that portion bestowed by father. O handsome one, as for myself, I shall enjoy the portion bestowed on me by my magnanimous father and shall take refuge in the Dandaka forest for fourteen years. I think what my great father, who is honoured by all men, and an equal to Indra, ordered is for my highest welfare. The will of the overlord of the world should not be done away with.       Thus ends the one hundredfourth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "That night passed off painfully for the four lion like brothers as they lamented, surrounded by their hosts of friends. When the night dawned, those brothers surrounded by their friends made (morning) ablutions and, after the prayers, returned to Rama. All of them sat together silently and no one uttered a word. Bharata alone from among  them addressed Rama saying: This kingdom was given to me for the satisfaction of my mother. I am bestowing it back on you. Enjoy it without any obstacles. Like a dyke bursts under pressure by the great surge of waters during the rainy season, this vast kingdom cannot be sustained by any one except yourself. O lord of the earth as an ass cannot follow the pace of a horse or a bird, the pace of Tarkshya (Garuda), I do not have the capability to follow you. O Rama, the life of a man on whom others depend for their sustenance is a happy life and the life of one who depends on others for his own mintenance is miserable. O mightyarmed Rama, a man plants a tree, rears it till it grows into such a large tree with a big trunk that it becomes difficult for a dwarf to climb. When the tree flowers but does not bear fruit, the man who planted it gets no pleasure out of the purpose for which the tree was planted. Being a mighty protector, do not chastise us who are your servants. This is a simile. You may better comprehend its implications. (The meaning of the simile is that if you do not assume the throne, the desire of our father, who nurtured you right from your childhood and hoped that one day you will become king and rule the people, will be in vain.)

(The meaning of the simile is that if you do not assume the throne, the desire of our father, who nurtured you right from your childhood and hoped that one day you will become king and rule the people, will be in vain.) O great king and subduer of enemies, may all the leading guilds of traders and other subjects behold you all over installed in the kingdom like the resplendent Sun. O Rama, let the elephants following you, intoxicated with ichor, be heard trumpeting. Let the women of the inner apartment rejoice with composed minds (when they hear of your return). Hearing the words of Bharata beseeching Rama to return, various classes of people of the city of Ayodhya, in approbation exclaimed well said. Having seen the illustrious Bharata lamenting that way, Rama, a man of firm determination and selfpossession, consoled him thus: A man is neither independent nor competent to do any act on his free will. Fate pulls him this way or the other. All accumulations of wealth deplete at the end. Every man who attains elevated positions falls at the end. Every union culminates in separation. Every life ends in death. The only fear of a ripened fruit is the fear of falling down (from the tree). In the same way every man who is born has no other fear except the fear of death. Even a house constructed with sturdy pillars gets dilapidated and ultimately decays. In the same way people under the sway of old age and death are destroyed (at last). A night that once passe off does not return like the waters of river Yamuna that flow into the ocean filled with water (the water do not flow back into Yamuna). The passing days and nights quickly decrease the life span of all living beings in this world, like sunrays drying up the water in summer. Whether you are static or moving, your lifespan decreases. Therefore, you should only grieve about yourself and not for any one else. Death follows a man wherever he goes. When he sits, death sits with him. Even after travelling a very long distance, the man returns along with death. Wrinkels form on the body and hair turns grey in old age. In this way, decayed with age, what can a man do to have control over death. People rejoice when the Sun rises and rejoice when the Sun sets. But they are unaware of the decline of the life span of their own. At the advent of each new season men feel delighted to see the newly blossomed flowers and fruits. But with the change of the scasons the life span also diminishes. In a mighty ocean, two pieces of logs meet one another, float together and in due course get separated. In the same way wives, sons, relatives and riches remain together for some time and thereafter get separated. Their separation is certain. In a mighty ocean, two pieces of logs meet one another, float together and in due course get separated. In the same way wives, sons, relatives and riches remain together for some time and thereafter get separated. Their separation is certain. No living being in this world can act as he likes. Therefore, no one should grieve for the dead. Like a man standing on the wayside says to a passing caravan, 'I am following you', and follows them, the road taken by our fathers and forefathers is certain for every one and cannot be violated by a person treading that path. (So) why should a man grieve? Like a man standing on the wayside says to a passing caravan, 'I am following you', and follows them, the road taken by our fathers and forefathers is certain for every one and cannot be violated by a person treading that path. (So) why should a man grieve? Like the flow of water which never reverts to its source, age passes. Therefore, a man must employ his self in righteous acts that bring him happiness. By doing so, it is said, people will always be happy. Our righteous father and lord of the earth, Dasaratha, attained heaven by giving abundant charities and performing several sacrifices in accordance with tradition. Our father nourished his dependents, splendidly governed his subjects and accepted  wealth through righteous ways. Because of these pious acts, he could go to heaven. Dasaratha, our father and lord of the earth, reached heaven by performing auspicious acts and offering abundant charities in sacrifices. King Dasaratha, lord of the earth, having performed various kinds of sacrifices and securing a long life, enjoyed abundance of pleasures and attained heaven. O dear our father, king Dasaratha, who was honoured by the virtuous and enjoyed the best of pleasures attained heaven after a long life. Therefore, he is not to be grieved over. Our father, king Dasaratha, abandoned the wornout mortal body, and obtained divine prosperity of wandering in the world of Brahma. No one like you or me should ever mourn about this highly sagacious and learned king who was proficient in scriptural knowledge. A wise man, holding on to his fortitude in all circumstances, should avoid such occasions of grief, these words of lamentation and this crying. O foremost of the eloquent, compose yourself. Do not grieve. Return to the city (Ayodhya) and reside there. You have been commanded so by our father who was a man of selfcontrol. I shall also stick to the command of our noble father who was a man of sacred deeds. O subduer of enemies, I cannot violate the order of the king. You also must respect it for he is our father and friend indeed. O Bharata, I will, therefore, obey the command of our venerable father, the champion of righteousness, by living in the forest. O best of men, if a man aspires to conquer the higher world, he should remain  virtuous, compassionate and obedient to his preceptors. O best of men, having seen the auspicious life of our father Dasaratha and his conduct, you also stick to your own duty. Rama, the magnanimous lord, addressed his younger brother Bharata with words full of significance, saying, Obey father's command and remained silent in a moment.       Thus ends the one hundredfifth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama remained silent after saying these meaningful words on the bank of river Mandakini. Then the Bharata, conforming to righteousness, replied in clear words to the virtuous Rama who was affectionate by nature. O subduer of enemies, you are of such nature that neither sorrow pains you nor pleasure delights you. There are none in this world like you. You are loved by the elders, for you seek their counsel whenever you have doubts. O subduer of enemies, you are of such nature that neither sorrow pains you nor pleasure delights you. There are none in this world like you. You are loved by the elders, for you seek their counsel whenever you have doubts. One should accept life and death, vice and virtue equally. How can one be afflicted when he has gained such an intellect? O lord of men, it is not proper for a person like you who knows the past and the future of human beings to feel distressed and lament over it. O magnanimous Rama, your nature is divine and you are true to your promises. You are omniscient, allseeing and wise. It is not proper for a virtuous man like you, who is cognizant in matters of life and death, to be overwhelmed by such insufferable grief. When I was away from home, my meanminded mother committed a sin for my sake which I never wished. You may pardon me graciously. I am bound by a bond of righteousness for which I am unble to slay my mother who deserves severe punishment for her sinful acts. How shall I, born to Dasaratha of noble race and righteous deeds, with the knowledge of dharma, do such a reprehensible and unrighteous deed? King Dasaratha, my father and preceptor, is godlike to me. Devoted to meritorious acts, he departed from this world in his old age. For this reason, I cannot reproach him (publicly) in this assembly (of men). O Rama, conversant with righteousness, will any one who knows the meaning of righteousness, do such a sinful act contrary to dharma and artha to please a woman? There is an ancient saying that at the time of death, the intellect of people is deluded. By conducting himself in this way, king Dasaratha has proved it. Our father has trangressed righteousness due to anger or delusion or recklessness. Therefore, you may think over the matter prudently and set it right. One who sets right the wrongs done by his father is a true son. Otherwise the son becomes just the opposite. (He is not  a son to the father). So be a worthy son and let not the sinful act committed by our father and condemned by men of wisdom be approved by you. Protect this entire kingdom, Kaikeyi, me and father, our friends and relations, citizens of the city and inhabitants of the countryside. Where is the forest and where is kshatriya's duty? Where are matted locks and where is governance of the kingdom? It does not behave you to do such acts antithetical to each other. O sagacious one, the primary duty of a kshatriya is to be crowned. This enables him to rule his subjects. Will any kshatriya, setting aside his first duty, follow an uncertain course of piety which is contrary to his dharma and whose impact may be felt in a remote future. If you so desire to follow the path of dharma acquired out of physical exertion, then bear the trouble of governing the four castes of the social order righteously. O Rama, you are the one who knows his duty. The knowers of dharma maintain that the life of a householder is the foremost among the four modes of life. How can you renounce it? Being younger to you in knowledge, position and birth, how can I rule the earth when you are present? I am a child, deficient in intelligence and virtue and even inferior in position. Deserted by  you, I do not wish to live. O one, conversant with righteousness rule unhindered this entire kingdom along with our relations inherited from our father. Let all ministers, subjects, and priests including Vasistha who are wellversed in Vedic hymns consecrate you here itself. After consecration, you too return to rule Ayodhya along with all of us like Indra who went back (to heaven), accompanied by Maruts after conquering all the worlds with his prowess. Discharging completely the three debts, to gods, to ancestors and to sages, subduing your enemies and gratifying your friends, you alone (have the right) to dictate me. O my esteemed brother let all your friends be delighted today at your enthronement and your enemies flee in terror in ten different directions. O best of men, wiping out all the censure on my mother, redeem our revered father from sin. I beseech you with my head bowed low, show mercy on me and every one of our relations, like Maheswara showing compassion on all living beings. If you turn your back on my solicitations and set out for the forest I shall also go along with you from here itself. Thus besought and propitiated by Bharata with his head bowed low and distressed, the virtuous lord of the world, Rama, firmly established in the words of his father, resolved not to go back to Ayodhya. Having seen the wonderful deternmination of Rama, people were, at once, anguished and delighted, anguished because he would not return to Ayodhya, and delighted because he was firm in his resolve. All the priests, the chiefs of merchant organizations and mothers who had their senses switched off and theif tears drained dry extolled Bharata for his words. All of them, reverentially saluting Rama, implored him.       Thus ends the one hundredsixth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Wellhonoured in the midst of relatives, the celebrated Rama, elder brother of Lakshmana, then said to Bharata who was going to speak again. Appropriate are the words spoken by you born to the celebrated king Dasaratha through Kaikeyi. Earlier when our father was to wed your mother, O dear brother, he had promised to your maternal grandfather that he would confer (on her) a kingdom with good revenue. Thereafter in the battle between gods and demons, the able king (Dasaratha) pleased  (with your mother) granted her a boon (as a token of gratitude). Thereafter, O tiger among men, your illustrious mother of fair complexion, under oath demanded of that best of men, king Dasaratha, the two boons, namely kingdom for you and banishment for me. Bound by such agreement (oath), the king granted her the boons. Thereafter, O tiger among men, your illustrious mother of fair complexion, under oath demanded of that best of men, king Dasaratha, the two boons, namely kingdom for you and banishment for me. Bound by such agreement (oath), the king granted her the boons. O best of men, that is why I have been ordered by father to live in the forest for fourteen years as per the (condition of the) boon. I have come to this lonely forest accompanied by Lakshmana and Sita, bent upon upholding the truth of our unrivalled father's words. O Indra among kings, let your coronation be performed without delay since you are worthy and at the same time the truthfulness of our father's words be honoured. O Bharata, release for my sake the competent king from his debt (of vow) and honour the righteous father and the mother as well. Dear (brother), it is heard that long ago an illustrious king while performing a sacrifice intended for ancestors at a sacred place known as Gaya, the sacrificer Gaya chanted a Vedic hymn as follows: Putra is so called as he delivers his father from a hell known as Put and protects the ancestors in all possible ways. One should desire many virtuous and learned sons so that at least one of them may go to Gaya (to perform the father's obsequies). O enhancer of the king's delight, O best of men rajarsis have decided this way. You may, therefore, O lord, protect your father against hell. O valiant Bharata, go to Ayodhya accompanied by Satrughna and the twiceborn (brahmins) and keep the subjects delighted like pleased (with your rule). O king (Bharata) I shall also enter the Dandaka forest without delay in the company of only these two -- the princess from Videha (Sita) and Lakshmana. O Bharata, be the king of men. I shall also become the supreme king of the wild beasts in the forest. Go now happily to Ayodhya, the best of cities, and I shall enter Dandaka forest with delight. Let an umbrella protect you against (scorching) sunshine and provide its cool shade over your head, O Bharata As for me, I shall happily seek the shade of these dense woodland trees. O Bharata, intelligent Satrughna will be your support and son of Sumitra (Lakshmana) as is wellknown will remain my best friend. All four of us, worthy sons of Dasaratha, shall follow the path of truth of our father.       Thus ends the one hundredseventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Rama, conversant with dharma, was consoling Bharata, Jabali an eminent brahmin addressed him in words contrary to righteousness. Very well, O scion of the Raghu race, you are nobleminded and highsouled. You, like a common man, must not entertain such nonsensical thought. Who is whose friend? who is to get what and from whom? Man is born alone and will die alone. O Rama one who establishes relationship by saying, 'She is my mother he is my father' is to be regarded as a lunatic. In fact, no one belongs to any one. A man who goes from one village to another takes rest somewhere on the way and the next day leaves the place and proceeds on his journey. Similarly, father, mother, home and wealth are restingplaces to a man. The wise do not get attached to them, O descendant the Kakutsthas A man who goes from one village to another takes rest somewhere on the way and the next day leaves the place and proceeds on his journey. Similarly, father, mother, home and wealth are restingplaces to a man. The wise do not get attached to them, O descendant the Kakutsthas O most virtuous of men, you ought not to abandon this patrimonial kingdom, adopt a course, which is painful, difficult and full of thorns (dangers). This (course) is unwise and unworthy of you. Go back to that prosperous city of Ayodhya and get yourself coronated. That city is a chaste woman wearing a single braid of hair awaiting you, her lord. O king's son, enjoy inestimable royal pleasures in the city of Ayodhya like Indra in heaven. Dasaratha was nobody to you and you are nobody to him. That king is one person and you are another. Therefore, do what I tell you. (It does not matter what you are to him and what he means to you). For a living being, the father is only a drop of white blood (semen). During her menstrual period this is blended in the mother's womb due to which a man is born in this world. That king (Dasaratha) has gone to the place where he ought to go. Such is the nature of mortals. You are fruitlessly undergoing difficulties. I prity those who yearn for dharma and artha and not for other things since those who have experienced adversities in this world (disregarding their own interest), will be ultimately destroyed any way by death. People perform ashtaka ceremony for the spirits of ancestors and offer them food. Look at the amount of food being wasted. Will the dead (ever) eat food? If something eaten by one in this world can enter the body of another, then a shraddha can be performed for a person who has set out on a distant journey. Will that offering turn into food for him on his way? It was to induce people to give charity that treatises are composed by intelligent men exhorting, 'perform sacrifices', 'give charity', 'be initiated', 'practise religious austerities', 'renounce', etc. O highminded one thinking that the next world does not exist, practise whichever is evident and perceivable. And turn your back on what is beyond perception. Honour the decision of the wise that serves as an instance to all and accept the kingdom offered by Bharata with pleasure       Thus ends the one hundredeighth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing Jabali's words, Rama, the foremost among the truthful, gave a rejoinder, exercising his own judgment and firm conviction with due respect (to Jabali). Althoug what you have said appears to be salutary, it is actually unwholesome. It appears to be beneficial but is really detrimental. A man not bound by morality, engaged in evil deeds and conducts himself contrary to good character is not respected by the virtuous. It is only the character that tells whether a man is highborn or not, brave or only proud of his manliness, honest or dishonest. If like a man who appears noble, though ignoble, clean, though unclean or dishonest, auspicious, though inauspicious, a man of character, though depraved, I forsake auspicious ways for unrighteousness, abandon pious acts and scriptural practices and indulge, under the cloak of dharma, in acts of wickedness by causing harm and confusion to the world, will any sensible man with a sense of discrimination between should and should not hold me in high esteem? If like a man who appears noble, though ignoble, clean, though unclean or dishonest, auspicious, though inauspicious, a man of character, though depraved, I forsake auspicious ways for unrighteousness, abandon pious acts and scriptural practices and indulge, under the cloak of dharma, in acts of wickedness by causing harm and confusion to the world, will any sensible man with a sense of discrimination between should and should not hold me in high esteem? If like a man who appears noble, though ignoble, clean, though unclean or dishonest, auspicious, though inauspicious, a man of character, though depraved, I forsake auspicious ways for unrighteousness, abandon pious acts and scriptural practices and indulge, under the cloak of dharma, in acts of wickedness by causing harm and confusion to the world, will any sensible man with a sense of discrimination between should and should not hold me in high esteem? How can I advise others for a virtuous conduct or how can I attain heaven if I break the vow which I follow at present. The entire world conducts itself as per its own sweet will. Therefore the subjects will follow the same path as their kings. Truth and nonviolence are the perpetual principles of kings. Therefore, a kingdom is based on truth. This world is firmly established in truth. Sages and gods all accept truth (as the supreme virtue). A truthful man of this world, attains the highest state (abode). People are frightened at the sight of a man speaking untruth as though they have seen a serpent. Truth in this world is the greatest virtue and is said to be the very foundation of heaven. Truth is God. The goddess of wealth always takes refuge in truth. Truth is the root of everything. It is supreme and there is nothing above it. Charity, sacrifice, libations, mortifications, asceticism and the Vedas have truth as their foundation. Therefore, every one should be an adherent of truth. One protects the world. Another runs his family. One plunges into hell. Another is honoured in heaven. (These are the fruits of truth and untruth). I am always true to any promise. I am bound by truth. Why shouId I (now) disobey  my father's command (to keep his promise)? I am always true to my promise. I will not break the bridge of truth of my father out of either greed or delusion or ignorance or illusion. We have heard that the offerings of a man inclined to untruth, of an unstable and unsteady mind are accepted neither by the gods nor by the ancestors. I personally regard this righteousness practised by the virtuous as an evident form of truth, as the supreme self. Therefore, this burden (difficult task of living as an exile) is gratifying to me. I renounce the socalled kshatriya code of conduct followed by the mean the cruel, the greedy and by men of evil deeds which is unrighteousness under the cloak of  righteousness. At first a man conceives an evil idea in his mind, then executes it through evil deed with his body and tells a lie through his tongue. Thus sinful action is three dimensional (mental, physical and vocal). Land (kingdom) glory, and wealth pursue a man, they long for him even if he is in heaven. Therefore, every one must take recourse to truth alone. The course you thought excellent and 'this auspicious act' you urged me in a cleverlyworded statement to perform is ignoble indeed. Having sworn before my father that I would live in the forest, how can I act upon Bharata's request in disregard to my father's words? I had taken a firm vow in the presence of my father (about my stay in the forest). And then Devi Kaikeyi was immensely delighted. I shall spend the term of my forest life with faith and holiness and purity of mind and with regulated food and with ancestors and gods satisfied with offerings of roots, flowers and fruits, with my five senses contented and with a mind that discriminates between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. I shall spend the term of my forest life with faith and holiness and purity of mind and with regulated food and with ancestors and gods satisfied with offerings of roots, flowers and fruits, with my five senses contented and with a mind that discriminates between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having reached this land of (religious) actions, one should perform auspicious rites. As fruit of their actions, Agni, Vayu and Soma have obtained their status. After performing a hundred sacrifices, king of the gods (Indra) obtained (dominion over) heaven. Great sages attained heaven after resorting to intense mortifications. The highly energetic prince, Rama, could not tolerate these atheistic arguments of Jabali for which he had to utter these words full of disdain: The virtuous maintain that truthfulness, righteousness, valour, compassion towards all beings, speaking pleasing words, paying homage to gods, brahmins and guests -- all these are  paths to heaven. Therefore, brahmins who have rightly understood the meaning of righteousness and adopt, with unmost care, the righteous ways as laid down in the scriptures seek attainment of higher positions. You are a great atheist, you have fallen from the path of righteousness. You are guided by an intellect which is extremely peridous. I, therefore, disapprove of my father's decision in inducting a man like you (into the council of ministers). Just as a thief, so is the Buddha (a wise men). Know that the Tathagatas are atheists. They are men most distrusted among the people. A learned man should avoid atheists. (Note: Verses 31 to 39 appear to be interpolations, It is anachronistic to talk about Buddha in Tretayuga.) Men superior to you in preceding generations had conquered this world and the other world by always performing many auspicious acts. Twiceborn brahmins perform religious acts and offer libations for the welfare of the world. Those supreme ascetics who are radiant, devoted to righteousness and associated with men of virtue, with charity as their chief virtue, eschewing violence and purged of their impurities are truly worthy of reverence in this world. Having heard the wrathful words of the magnanimous Rama of fearless intellect, that brahmin (Jabali) thus humbly replied in palatable, truthful words full of faith (in god). I do not speak the language of atheists. I am not an atheist. I do not say that the next world does not exist. In keeping with time (occasion) I shall speak the language of a believer or a nonbeliever. O Rama, since the appropriate time has slowly come, I have uttered this. In order to persuade you to return and to propitiate you I have said these words.       Thus ends the one hundredninth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing Rama angry Vasistha intercedes, saying that Jabali is wellaware of the exits and entrances of humans on earth. O lord of the worlds, Jabali had spoken all this only with the intention to make you return (to Ayodhya). Listen I shall (now) relate to you the origin of the world. At the beginning, all this was water from which the earth was created. Thereafter, the selfexistent Brahma along with the gods came into existence. Then he assumed the form of a boar and uplifted the earth and created this world   with his progeny of purified souls. Eternal, changeless and imperishable Brahma arose from space and to him was born Marichi and to Marichi, Kasyapa. Kasyapa begot Vivaswat (the Sun) and Vivaswat, Manu. This Manu was the first Prajapati to him whom was born Ikshvaku. Manu had orginally bestowed the most prosperous earth on Ikshvaku and you know  Ikshvaku was the first king of Ayodhya. Ikshvaku had an illustrious son, wellknown as Kukshi and to Kukshi was born the heroic Vikukshi. The son of Vikukshi was highly energetic and powerful Bana and to him was born the mightyarmed Anaranya of great renown. When Anaranya, the best of the virtuous, was ruling the kingdom, there was no drought, no famine and not even a thief (in his kingdom). Mightyarmed king Prithu was the son of Anaranya and Prithu was father of the great king Trishanku. That heroic Trishanku, on account of his truthfulness ascended the heaven with his physical body. Trishanku's son was illustrious Dundhumara, father of the exceedingly powerful Yuvanaswa. Majestic Mandhata was Yuvanasva's son and father of mighty Susandhi. Sudsandhi had two sons Dhruvasandhi and Prasenjit. Renowned Bharata, slayer of enemies, was the son of Dhruvasandhi. Majestic Mandhata was Yuvanasva's son and father of mighty Susandhi. Sudsandhi had two sons Dhruvasandhi and Prasenjit. Renowned Bharata, slayer of enemies, was the son of Dhruvasandhi. Mightyarmed Bharata had a son named Asita against whom the Haihayas, Talajanghas and the indomitable Sasibindus, the rival kings rose as enenmies. Mightyarmed Bharata had a son named Asita against whom the Haihayas, Talajanghas and the indomitable Sasibindus, the rival kings rose as enenmies. Although king Asita engaged all of them in a battle, he was (defeated and) driven into exile. He retired to a delightful, tall mountain and lived a life of contentment of a sage. Both his wives became pregnant. It is said that one of them gave the other poison (with the motive) to destroy the embryo. O queen, you will beget a son who will be magnanimous, virtuous, renowned in the world. He will be the perpetuator of the race and destroyer of enemies. The queen was happy. She circumambulated the sage, took leave of him and came back home. Thereafter, she gave birth to a son who had eyes like lotus petals and who looked resplendent like Brahma. The queen was happy. She circumambulated the sage, took leave of him and came back home. Thereafter, she gave birth to a son who had eyes like lotus petals and who looked resplendent like Brahma. With a motive to destroy the embryo her cowife had poisoned her. That child was born with gara or poison for which he was called  Sagara. The king Sagara performed a sacrifice on the fullmoon day. And swiftly dug the ocean that frightened the people. We have heard that a son, Asamanja by name, was born to Sagara. For his sinful deeds he was banished by his father while he was still alive. Valiant Anshuman was the son of Asamanja and the father of Dilipa. Dilipa's son was Bhagiratha. To Bhagiratha was born Kakutstha, by whom your race is wellknown. A son Raghu was born to Kakutstha and hence all of you are known as Raghavas. The illustrious son of Raghu became famous in the world under the names of  Kalmasapada and Sowdasa. The curse of a sage turned him a devourer of men for some years. Shankhana was the famous son of Kalmashapada. Whoever challenged his prowess was routed  with his entire army. The son of Shankhana was the glorious Sudarshana, father of Agnivarna. Shighraga was the son of Agnivarna whose son was Maru. Maru's son was Prashushruva and to Prashushruva was born splendid Ambarisha. Nahusha of indisputable prowess was the son of Ambarisha whose son was the supremely righteous Nabhaga. Nabhaga had two sons, Aja and Suvrata and Aja's son was the righteous king Dasaratha. The son of Shankhana was the glorious Sudarshana, father of Agnivarna. Shighraga was the son of Agnivarna whose son was Maru. Maru's son was Prashushruva and to Prashushruva was born splendid Ambarisha.

Being the eldest son of king Dasaratha and widely  known as Rama you happen to be the  heir apparent. Hence, O king, accept the kingdom and look after the people.",
                "Vasistha, the family priest, continued to speak to Rama on righteousness. Every man born has three preceptors. They are his teacher, father and mother. O best of men, the father brings forth a son. The teacher imparts him wisdom. Therefore, the teacher is considered superior. I was preceptor to your father and also to you. O destroyer of foes, by following my words, you will not transgress the path of the virtuous. All these learned men, guilds of merchants and the twiceborn (brahmins) of this assembly are your men. By fulfilling your duty towards them, you will never swerve from the path of the virtuous. Here is your aged and righteous mother. It does not behove you to deny your service to her. By obeying her, you will never deviate from the path of the virtuous. O scion of the Raghus whose strength springs from truth and righteousness, if you accede to the prayers of Bharata, you will not ignore the call of your soul. When Rama, the best of men, was advised personally by Vasistha, the preceptor, with sweet words, he replied to him who was sitting beside him: The course of action the parents always adopt in respect of their son, the benefits they confer on him according to their resources, the way they lull him to sleep and clothe him, the affectionate words they always speak to him and the way they bring him up all these cannot be repaid. The course of action the parents always adopt in respect of their son, the benefits they confer on him according to their resources, the way they lull him to sleep and clothe him, the affectionate words they always speak to him and the way they bring him up all these cannot be repaid. King Dasaratha is my father who begot me. The promise I made him shall not prove false. Having been addressed by Rama in this way, Bharata of great generosity, in extreme distress, addressing the charioteer who was standing nearby said: O charioteer, quickly spread kusa grass on the bare ground. Until my esteemed brother shows his grace, I shall lie down here -- waiting. Like a poor brahmin, starving, my face muffled, I shall lie down in front of the hut until he agrees to return. Bharata was mentally disturbed saw Sumantra waiting for Rama's order. Then he himself brought a heap of kusa grass and spread it on the ground. Rama, the foremost of royal sages and highly powerful said, 'Dear Bharata, what wrong have I done that you should prevent me by lying down in front of me?' A brahmin alone is competent in this world to prevent a person by lying down on one side (in front of him). One who is anointed king is not permitted by (scriptural) tradition to squat in protest. O Bharata, O tiger among men, O scion of the Raghu race give up this formidable vow. Arise and quickly return to Ayodhya, the best of cities. While remaining seated, Bharata looking all around at the inhabitants from towns and villages, questioned them 'why don't you all persuade my esteemed brother to return'. Those inhabitants from towns and villages replied to the magnanimous Bharata 'we  know the scion of the Kakutha dynasty, Rama, very well. What he has said is proper'. Highly distinguished Rama is firmly fixed on the command of his father. That is why we are incapable of making him return quickly. Having understood their words, Rama said to him, 'Listen to the words of our friends who have a righteous vision.' O mightyarmed son of the Raghus, you have heard both (them and me). Carefully think over. Arise. Touch me and sip water. Then Bharata stood up and performed achamana (sipping of water) and said 'let the assembly of  learned men, counsellors and guildsmen hear me'. I never asked my father to confer the kingdom on me. I never urged my mother to seek the kingdom for me. I never supported the exile of my esteemed brother Rama, who is supreme in the knowleldge of righteousness. If it is absolutely essential to live in the forest in accordance with the command of my father, I myself  shall also dwell in the forest for fourteen years. On hearing the genuine sentiments of his brother, righteous Rama was astonished. He said to the inhabitants from towns and villages: Neither Bharata nor I can in any way annul anything which was sold, pledged or bought by my father during his lifetime. As far as living in the forest is concerned it is reprehensible to keep a subsitute for me and it shall not be done. Kaikeyi has acted rightfully and my father has taken the proper decision. I know Bharata as a man of forbearance and one who honours elders. Everything will turn out well for this great soul wedded to truth. On returning from the forest, I shall become the supreme lord of this earth along with this virtuous brother. The king (Dasaratha) was solicited by Kaikeyi and I shall abide. Therefore, you also release the lord of the earth, our father from the charge of falsehood.       Thus ends the hundredeleventh sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The great sages assembled there were amazed at witnessing the meeting of the two brothers (Rama and Bharata) of umparalleled briliance. The hosts of sages, siddhas and devarshis watching invisible the two Kakutstha  brothers extoled them. On hearing their dialogue we are deeply drawn towards them, these two sons of king Dasaratha who was fortunate to have these practioners of righteousness and whose strength is dharma. Thereafter hosts of rishis desiring the speedy destruction of tenheaded Ravana said these words to Bharata, the best of kings. O Bharata, born in an illustrious race, highly sagacious and a man of virtuous conduct and great renown, accept Rama's proposal if you have any regard for your father. We always desire that Rama should discharge his debt to his father. Dasaratha, who by redeeming himself of his obligation to Kaikeyi, had ascended heaven. Then the great rishis, gandharvas and royal sages having said this, returned to their respective abodes. Of pleasing appearance, Rama, gladdened by the auspicious statements (of the sages),  paid them homage with a cheerful countenance. Before Bharata, with his limbs trembling and with palms folded (in reverence) was   ready to depart, he said to Rama: O Rama, keeping in view the code of kings and tradition of our family, it behoves you to consider my supplication and that of my mother. I do not venture to protect this kingdom all by myself and keep the inhabitants of the towns and villages who are loyal to you pleased. All our relatives, warriors, friends and wellwishers long to see you like farmers yearn for the raincloud. O sagacious Rama, accept this kingdom and ensure its stability. You are powerful enough to govern this world. So accept this kingdom and restore its stability. Having said this, Bharata, fell at the feet of his brother, and speaking sweetly, he profusely  entreated  Rama. Rama took his in his arms Bharata who had a darkblue complexion, whose eyes were like petals of lotus and whose voice was the voice of an amorous swan. O child, this wisdom of yours is both inborn and imbibed through training. With this, you are perfectly capable of protecting the earth. After due consultation with ministers, friends, counsellors and prudent persons,   accomplish all tasks, however formidable they may appear. The Moon might lose its splendour, snow might abandon the Himavat mountain, the ocean might overstep its shores, but I shall not forsake the promise made to my father. Dear brother, whether out of affection or greed, your mother has done this for your sake. It should not agitate your mind. You should conduct yourself as one should towards one's mother. On hearing this, Bharata replied to the son of  Kausalya who looked like the Sun or the new Moon in brilliance: O noble one, place your feet on these sandals decorated with gold. They will secure the prosperity and safety of the entire world. Rama, the best of men, one with great brilliance, put on and then put off the sandals  and presented them to the magnanimous Bharata. Bharata bowed before the sandals and said to Rama, 'O tormentorr of enemies, O hero, wearing matted locks and bark garments, living on fruits and roots, placing the responsibility of ruling the kingdom on your sandals and looking forward to your arrival, I shall reside outside the city for fourteen years.' Bharata bowed before the sandals and said to Rama, 'O tormentorr of enemies, O hero, wearing matted locks and bark garments, living on fruits and roots, placing the responsibility of ruling the kingdom on your sandals and looking forward to your arrival, I shall reside outside the city for fourteen years.' O best of the Raghus, if I do not behold you on the day after completion of fourteen years I shall enter the blazing fire. 'Be it so', assured Rama and then affectionately embracing both Bharata and Satrughna, said to Bharata: Look after your mother, O chief of the Raghus Do not be angry with her. Swear in my name and in the name of Sita. So saying, eyes filled with tears, Rama took leave of his brother. Look after your mother, O chief of the Raghus Do not be angry with her. Swear in my name and in the name of Sita. So saying, eyes filled with tears, Rama took leave of his brother. The valiant and righteous Bharata, worshipped the welldecorated sandals and after circumambulating Rama reverentially placed them atop the best of elephants. Inflexibly fixed in his own code of righteouness, like the Himavat mountain, Rama, the enhancer of the progeny of the Raghu dynasty, paid respect due to the preceptors, ministers and subjects in accordance with their rank, blessed his younger brothers, Bharata and Satrughna and sent them forth. His mothers were unable to bid him farewell their throats were choked with tears of sorrow but Rama himself paid obeisance to them and entered his hut in tears.       Thus ends the hundredtwelfth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Bharata accompanied by Satrughna, placing the sandals on his head in delight, boarded the chariot. Vasishta, Vamadeva, Jabali of rigorous penance and all the ministers honoured for their counsel proceeded ahead. All of them circumambulated the mighty mountain Chitrakuta and proceeded east towards the charming river Mandakini. Beholding a thousand varieties of beautiful minerals, Bharata with his army proceeded  alongside the mountain. Not far from Chitrakuta mountain, Bharata beheld a hermitage where sage Bharadwaja resided. On approaching the hermitage of sage Bharadwaja, Bharata  alighted from the chariot, and prostrated at his feet. Then Bhardwaja asked Bharata in delight, My son, have you accomplished your task?  Did you meet  Rama? Having been thus addressed by wise Bharadwaja, Bharata, devoted to righteousness, replied: Entreated by me and by preceptor (Vasistha), the highly pleased Rama with his  firmness of mind replied  to Vasistha: In sooth, I shall honour the words of promise given by my father and live in the forest for fourteen years, as promised. On hearing him, Vasistha a great intellectual and highly eloquent one replied to Rama, skilled in words of deep significance. O extremely sagacious one, bestow with pleasure your sandals decked with gold for security and safety of Ayodhya. Thus addressed by Vasistha, Rama stood facing eastward wearing these sandals. and bestowed them on me for the sake of ruling the kingdom. I am now returning to Ayodhya with these auspicious sandals permitted by the  magnanimous Rama. Hearing the auspicious words of  the magnanimous Bharata, sage Bharadwaja said to  him in words still more  auspicious. O best of men, foremost among men of excellent character and dispositon, it is not surprising that all noble qualities come to reside in you naturally like water poured flowing downward. With you as his son, endowed with qualities of righteousness and devotion to duty, your mightyarmed father Dasaratha is not dead. (He lives through you). Hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharadwaja, Bharata paid his respect, folding his palms,  and clasping the feet of the sage and sought his permission to leave. Then illustrious Bharata circumambulated the sage several times in homage  before he set out for Ayodhya with his counsellors. The vast army of Bharata with all its carriages, carts, horses and elephants following   him again turned  back towards Ayodhya. Thereafter, all of them crossed  the divine river Yamuna wreathed in waves and, beheld  the Ganga of sacred waters once again. Bharata along with his kins and his army crossed the Ganga with its overflowing,  wonderful waters and entered the beautiful city of Sringiberapura and from there he proceeded until he beheld the city of Ayodhya. On seeing the city of Ayodhya bereft of his father and brothers, Bharata, consumed with grief, said to the charioteer: O charioteer, look, Ayodhya is in shapeless shambles. It is silent and cheerless. It is dull and desolate. It shines no more.       Thus ends the hundredthirteenth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Bharata, the renowned lord (of Ayodhya) travelled on the chariot that produced a deep, soothing, sound. And entered Ayodhya soon. (The city looked) like Rohini, the beloved consort of the Moon, the star which was majesticlly radiating flaming brilliance and now, tormented by the exalted Rahu which has eclipsed the Moon, shines alone. (It appeared) like a lean mountainstream with scant, hot and turbid waters, with scorched aquatic birds and with small and large fishes and crocodiles dead due to the heat of the Sun. warriors slain in the great battle (the city appeared desolate). the midst of the herd despairs and no longer grazes the new grass. with the melodious humming of intoxicated bees and suddenly shrivelling, ravaged by the fastspreading forest fire. Ayodhya with its markets and shops closed, and its merchants in a daze looked like the sky covered with clouds obscuring the Moon and stars. (Ayodhya looked) like an uncleansed drinking place with broken pitchers emptied of excellent wine scattered around and with drunkards lying dead in the open. (Ayodhya appeared) like a ruined well, its foundations broken and sunken into the earth, its water used up, with broken pots scattered around, its riven surface forming a dale. Illustrious Bharata, son of Dasaratha, seated in his chariot, addressed the charioteer as he drove the most excellent of chariots saying: How is it that in Ayodhya, the deep and allpervasive songs and sounds of musical instruments of the former days are not heard now? The breeze no longer carries the intoxicating odour of spirituous liquor, the pervading fragrance of flower garlands and agaru (incense). After Rama's the exile the clatter of excellent carriages, the pleasing neighing of horses and trumpeting of elephants in rut and the rattle of chariots are no longer heard now. Since Rama has departed, the young men in distress do not enjoy expensive incense of agaru and sandalwood paste and garlands of fresh flowers. Since Rama has departed, the young men in distress do not enjoy expensive incense of agaru and sandalwood paste and garlands of fresh flowers. This city is stricken with grief on account of Rama's departure. Men do not go out on pleasure jaunts wearing garlands of variegated flowers. Festivities are not celebrated. Certainly splendour has left along with my brother. Like the night when the rain pours down during the waning of the Moon, Ayodhya shines not. When will my brother return to Ayodhya like a carnival and cause delight to every one  like summer clouds? The highways of Ayodhya thronged with groups of elegantly attired young men or adults with their majestic gait, do not shine. Thus mourning in several ways, Bharata entered his fathers' palace (now) bereft of the king like a cave without the lion.",
                "After keeping his mothers in Ayodhya, the griefstricken Bharata who was firm in his vows, said to the elders: I take leave of all of you. I am going to Nandigrama where I shall keep company with grief on account of Rama's absence. King Dasaratha has gone to heaven. My elder brother and guru is in the forest. I shall await his return for ruling the kingdom since he alone is the illustrious king of Ayodhya. Hearing the auspicious words of the magnanimous Bharata the counsellors, priests including Vasistha replied: O Bharata, the words you have uttered out of devotion to your brother which befit you alone are highly praiseworthy. You are always attached to your relations, firmly established in the welfare of your brothers and are pursuing a noble path. Who would not approve of this? On hearing the pleasing words of the counsellors which were in conformity with his desire, Bharata said to his charioteer, 'Harness my chariot'. With a cheerful countenance illustrious Bharata paid obeisance to all his mothers and, acompanied by Satrughna, ascended the chariot. Highly pleased, Bharata and Satrughna ascended the chariot and, surrounded by counsellors and priests, set out  speedily. Preceded by preceptors, like Vasistha and other brahmins, all of them proceeded eastward in the direction of Nandigrama. When Bharata left, the army with hordes of elephants, horses and chariots and  inhabitants of Ayodhya  followed him unbidden. Righteous Bharata who was deeply attached to his brother proceeded speedily towards Nandigrama on the chariot bearing the sandals of Rama on his head. Bharata entered Nandigrama quickly, alighted from the chariot and then, addressing, the preceptors, said: My brother gave me this kingdom as a trust. He gave me the sandals decorated with gold for securing the prosperity and security (of the kingdom). Then Bharata placed the sandals held in trust on his head and, overcome with grief, he addressed the concourse of subjects: Hold the royal paresol now. This is the accepted symbol of the exalted feet of my brother. These sandals shall establish righteousness in the kingdom. This kingdom has been given me by my brother out of affection as a trust. I shall safeguard it until Rama's return. 'I myself shall see soon Rama's feet reunited with these sandals. The burden of this kingdom has been cast on me. On reunion with Rama, I shall hand it over to my brother, my guru and shall be engaged in his service. Restoring the sacred sandals, the kingdom and this city of Ayodhya held as a trust by me, I shall be cleansed of the sin. After Rama is coronated and the people are delighted and pleased, the renown and pleasure for me will be fourfold (what is obtained from ruling the kingdom). Thus lamenting in desolation and grief, the illustrious Bharata lived in Nandigrama along with his counsellors and started ruling the kingdom. Bharata, the warrior and lord, wore bark garments and matted locks and lived the life of an ascetic in Nandigrama along with his army. Bharata who was attached to his brother and ever obedient to him, fulfilled his vow. He coronated the sandals and lived at Nandigrama longing for the return of Rama. Bharata reported everything relating to the kingdom to the sandals first. Waving the chamaras (a fan made of yak tail) himself, he held the royal parasol over them. After the coronation of the sandals of his esteemed brother Rama, illustrious Bharata ruled the kingdom, subordianating himself to them. Whenever an issue, however small, arose, Bharata kept the sandals informed. Whenever a valuable gift was presented, he offered it to the sandals before he accepted it.       Thus ends the hundredfifteenth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After Bharta, had departed, Rama who was living in the penancegrove of ascetics observed that the ascetics were filled with apprehensions, and were eager (to leave that forest). Rama observed that the sages who earlier sought to stay with him near his hermitage under his protection on chitrakuta were filled with anxiety (now). Those sages, glancing at Rama with suspicious eyes, knitting their eyebrows and murmering among themselves, conversed secretly. Having observed their anxiety, Rama apprehending somethig in his mind approached  the chief of the hermitage with folded palms and said: O revered sire, have you seen any change in my conduct? For what reason are the sages looking perturbed? Have the sages found my younger brother Lakshmana doing something unbecoming of him through inadvertence? Has Sita devoted in her service to me and engaged in serving you failed to follow the conduct befitting a woman? Hearing those words, an ascetic old in age and austerities, as though trembling said  to Rama who is compassionate to all beings: O dear child, how can goodnatured Sita who is always engaged in performing auspicious deeds, especially towards ascetics be associated with violation of duty? There is apprehension for ascetics from the demons on acount of your presence here. That is why they are conversing with one another about the likely fallout. O dear child, Khara, one of the brothers of Ravana is dwelling in nearby 'Janasthana'. He is impudent, reportedly winner of battles, cruel, sinful, a maneater and haughty. He has uprooted all the ascetics  from Janasthana. He will not tolerate even you. O dear child, Khara, one of the brothers of Ravana is dwelling in nearby 'Janasthana'. He is impudent, reportedly winner of battles, cruel, sinful, a maneater and haughty. He has uprooted all the ascetics  from Janasthana. He will not tolerate even you. O dear child, ever since you started residing in this hermitage rakshasas have been  tormenting the ascetics. They appear in various distorted forms now rapacious, now fearful, now deformed. Those wicked rakshasas employ forbidden and dirty means against ascetics and kill them by suddenly appearing in front of them. These debased rakshasas, concealing themselves in various ashram sites take delight  in harassing and killing the ascetics. When sacrifices are about to start, they throw away the sacrificial ladels and vessels containing sacrificial materials and sprinkle water on sacrificial fire. They also break down the earthen vessels used in the sacrifice. Now all these sages are urging me to abandon this hermitage infested by these wicked rakshasas and move to another region. O Rama, those vile creatures resort to physical violence against ascetics, we have therefore, resolved to quit this ashram. Not very far from here stands an ancient ashram in a lovely forest abounding in roots and fruits and I with my companions will seek shelter there. Dear child, Khara will also misbehave with you as usual. (Therefore), if you so decide you may come along with us. O Rama, even though you are always vigilant and capable in all possible ways to defend youself, a doubt arises in our mind. It is perilous for you to live here with your wife. It was not possible for prince Rama to hold back by mere words that ascetic who was saying like this and was anxious to quit the hermitage. The leader of the group quit the hermitage along with his companions after paying  respect to Rama, convincing him and taking leave of him. Rama, followed the sages for some distance to bid them farewell. He paid obeisance to the chief of the group and having grasped the instruction of the highly pleased  sages, he with their consent returned to his holy hermitage. Lord Rama, did not leave that hermitage deserted by the sages even for a moment. Those who had adopted the traditions of the sages and  had acquired many virtues followed Rama.       Thus ends the hundredsixteenth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the ascetics had departed, Rama thought over the matter well and did not like to reside there for many reasons. It is here that Bharata, mothers along with citizens of Ayodhya have visited me. That  memory soaked with grief is chasing me. Due to the encampment of the army of the magnanimous Bharata (here), this place has been filled with the dung of horses and elephants and made exceedingly dirty. We shall, therefore, go to some other place, having resolved thus, Rama accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana set forth. Having reached the hermitage of the revered sage Atri, illustrious Rama prostrated before him and Atri also received him as his son. That sage Atri himself extended to Rama the hospitality befitting him in all possible ways and treated Lakshmana and highly virtuous Sita with kind words. Conversant in the ways of righteousness and eagaged in the welfate of all beings, sage Atri called out his aged wife who is revered by all and spoke kind words to her. Atri, who was excellent among the sages said to his ascetic wife who was highly virtuous and an adherent of righteousness, Welcome Sita. Thereafter, he related to Rama a story about his asetic wife who follows the ways of righteousness. O blameless one (Rama), once this world was consecutively ravaged by drought for ten years. It was the virtuous Anasuya who created roots and fruits and caused Ganga to flow. She was engaged in severe mortifications and selfimposed religious observances. She practised severe asceticism for ten thousand years bathed in her vows. Solicited on behalf of the gods, she removed all impediments and converted ten nights into one. She is like a your mother to you. O blameless one (Rama), once this world was consecutively ravaged by drought for ten years.

She practised severe asceticism for ten thousand years bathed in her vows. Solicited on behalf of the gods, she removed all impediments and converted ten nights into one. She is like a your mother to you. 'She is renowned throughout this world for her deeds as Anasuya, (one who is free from anger). Aged, illustrious she is free frm anger, worthy of adoration by all beings. Let Sita approach her'. Hearing those words of the sage, Rama said be it so and said to righteous Sita these choice words. O princess, you have heard the message of the sage. Without delay approach the ascetic (Anasuya) for your welfare. Having heard the words of Rama, intended for her welfare, Sita, daughter of the king of Mithila, approached the consort of Atri (Devi Anasuya), knower of righteousness, and reverently circumambulated her. Highly chaste and fortunate Anasuya was very old and feeble. Her skin was wrinkled and her hair turned grey due to old age. Her body was constantly trembling like a plantain tree in a stormy wind. Pronouncing her name to such Anasuya, Sita made obeisance to her with utmost concentration. Highly chaste and fortunate Anasuya was very old and feeble. Her skin was wrinkled and her hair turned grey due to old age. Her body was constantly trembling like a plantain tree in a stormy wind. Pronouncing her name to such Anasuya, Sita made obeisance to her with utmost concentration. Sita offered her obeisance to the blameless ascetic, Anasuya, folding her palms and enquired of her wellbeing in delight. Anasuya was delighted  to see the glorious Sita who was always engaged in righteous acts and  said in kind words, You are fortunate. You are observing your rightful duty. O noble Sita, by the grace of heaven you are following Rama, forsaking your kinsmen and wealth and confining yourself to the forest. One who is devoted to her husband, whether he be in the city or in the forest, whether  he is sinful or virtuous, will attain the most prosperous worlds. For a woman of noble nature her husband, whether he be licentious or of bad character or devoid of riches, is her supreme lord. O Sita, on reflection I know of none who is a better friend than the husband. He, like an imperishable penance, once acquired is never lost. Those wicked women whose minds are overpowered by carnal desires, ranging at will as lords of their husbands, do not understand about vice and virtue. O Sita, those women  under the control of unworthy acts are dislodged from the path of righteousness and get infamy. Women like you who are endowed with virtues and can distinguish between good and bad in this world, like those who  perform  virtuous deeds, will move about in heaven.",
                "When Anasuya thus addressed Vaidehi who is free from any malice, she worshipped  Anasuya  and started speaking in a gentle tone. It is no wonder that a noble lady like you should  instruct me this way. It is known to me that a husband is a guru to his wife. O noble lady, even if my husband is devoid of good conduct, he should be obeyed without showing any hesitation. What to speak of a husband if he is worthy of applause for his virtues, is compassionate, a subduer of the senses, righteous and ever affectionate like a mother and a father? Mighty Rama shows the same behaviour and treatment towards the other consorts of the king as he does towards his own mother Kausalya. Heroic Rama is affectionate towards king Dasaratha and is conversant with righteousness. Renouncing the sense of selfrespect he honours all the women on whom his father had cast his glance even once just as his own mother. When departing for this frightful and desolate forest, the great (advice) imparted by my motherinlaw is firmly fixed in my mind. When I have been taught by my mother earlier, at the time of bestowal of my hand to Rama in the presence of the sacrificial fire (as witness) is etched in my mind. O righteous one (Anasuya), after listening to your words the instructions given by my motherinlaw and my mother are renewed (remembered again). For a woman, no other penance is laid down (in scriptures) except service to her husband. Having served her husband (faithfully), Savitri is honoured in heaven. You also, by following the same path of serving your husband, shall reach the heaven. Rohini, the very best among all women and the goddess of heaven, is never seen in the sky separated from the moon even for a moment. Execellent women such as these, firm in their vows to their husband are highly revered in the world of gods through their own meritorious deeds. Thereafter hearing Sita's words, Anasuya affectionately kissed her forehead and said this in order to make her happy: O Sita of pure conduct, I have great ascetic power obtained through practising various austerities. With its strength I shall give what you want for your enjoyment. O Sita, I am glad to hear your befitting and pleasing words. Tell me what appropriate  thing you desire and I shall give you. On hearing her words Sita was surprised. With a gentle smile she said, to Anasuya who was endowed with ascetic power, 'I think you have already granted me the boons'. When Sita said so, Anasuya who knew her righteous duty was immensely pleased. and replied, 'What a joy I shall make the words you have spoken come true'. O princess of Videha, O  Sita, I bestow on you this best garland of the gods, raiment, jewellery, fragrant unguents, and precious ointment for anointing your body with. All this will beautify your limbs. It is convenient (to use) and will never fade. O princess of Videha, O  Sita, I bestow on you this best garland of the gods, raiment, jewellery, fragrant unguents, and precious ointment for anointing your body with. All this will beautify your limbs. It is convenient (to use) and will never fade. O daughter of Janaka, you will enhance the glory of your husband by anointing your body with this divine, fragrant unguent to your body like Lakshmi enhancing the glory of eternal Visnu. That princess from Mithila accepted the incomparable gifts of love, the raiment, fragrant unguents, jewellery and also the garland. Illustrious Sita accepted the gifts of love and with palms folded in reverence sat beside her, an ascetic. Anasuya who was firm in her vows commenced to ask Sita this way about a certain tale (that was close to her heart). O Sita, I have heard that you have been won by the illustrious Rama in the swayamvara. At least that is the story which reached my ears. O daughter of Mithila, I would like to hear the story in detail. You should tell me the whole story as you experienced it. 'Listen' said Sita, thus addressed, and began relating the story to Anasuya, a performer of austerities. There is a king in Mithila, Janaka by name. He is heroic and is conversant with  righteousness. Engaged in the duties of a kshatriya, he is rules the earth with justice. When he was ploughing the circular plot of land for performing a sacrifice, it is said I emerged from the earth by breaking it and therefore I became his dauhghter. Engaged in sowing fistfuls of seeds, king Janaka found me covered with dust and was astonished. As he had no children, he, on his own accord, lifted me up and placing me on his lap, saying, This is my daughter, he began showering (lots of) love on me. 'O king, she is an incomparable divine being. By right she is your daughter'. These were the words (Janaka) heard from out of the sky. Thereafter, my father and the righteous lord of Mithila was delighted in possessing  me when a noble thought struck his mind. Bestowed as the choicest one of meritorious acts on the chief queen, I was brought up by her, by nature affectionate, with the love of a mother. When my father saw I had attained  the marriageable age, he was immersed in sorrow like an indigent man who had lost all his wealth. Even though he was an Indra on earth, as a father of  an unmarried girl he would be humiliated by men who are his equal or inferior in this world. Having perceived that the humiliation is not very far, king Janaka was plunged in a sea of sorrow like one who cannot reach the shore without a float. The ruler of the earth knew that I was not born from a woman's womb, and could not find a suitable husband for me after deep reflection. After constantly pondering over the matter, the wise king arrived at the decision to perform a swayamvara for his daughter. Magnanimous Varuna out of his affection had given him, on the occasion of a great sacrifice, an excellent bow with inexhaustible arrows and a pair of quivers. Because of its weight, no human could move that bow despite great effort nor were the kings capable of bending it even in their dreams. My truthful father, after having acquired the bow, invited all the princes and placed the great bow before them in the assembly where he declared: Beholding the mighty bow resembling a mountain in weight, the kings, unable to lift it, paid their homage and left. After a long time, resplendent Rama whose prowess was truth, arrived along with  his brother Lakshman and sage Viswamitra in order to witness the sacrifice. Having accepted the honour extended by my father, righteous Viswamitra spoke to him about those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana. 'Both these sons of king Dasaratha wish to see the bow. Show the divine bow to prince  Rama'. At the words of that ascetic, my father brought out the bow. Mighty and valiant Rama bent it and strung it and drew it in the twinkling of an eye. At the words of that ascetic, my father brought out the bow. Mighty and valiant Rama bent it and strung it and drew it in the twinkling of an eye. When Rama was stringing the bow with force, it was broken into two in the middle and fell down with a dreadful sound like that of thunder. Then, my father steadfast in truth, held a vessel of pure water and declared his decision to offer me to Rama. Then Rama did not accept the offer of my father straightaway before he knew the opinion of his father Dasaratha,  king of Ayodhya. Thereafter, my fatherinlaw, the aged king Dasaratha was invited and my father  offered me to Rama  known for his sagacity. My father, on his own accord, bestowed Urmila, my younger sister of chaste and of  pleasing appearance as wife to Lakshmana. In this way my father bestowed me on Rama in that swayamvara and I remain devoted to my husband who is the foremost among the valiant in treading the path of  righteousness.       Thus ends the one hundredeighteenth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then righteous Anasuya, having heard the great story of Sita, kissed her on the forehead and embraced her with both the arms. You have related wonderfully and sweetly your Swayamvara with each word and each syllable uttered clearly. I have heard everything as it happened. O sweetspeaking Sita, I have greatly enjoyed your story. The resplendent Sun has set. The auspcious night is drawing near. The birds who forage far and wide for food during the day return to their nests to rest for the night. You can hear them twittering. The resplendent Sun has set. The auspcious night is drawing near. The birds who forage far and wide for food during the day return to their nests to rest for the night. You can hear them twittering. The sages also  are returning in groups with waterpitchers filled with water and their bark robes soaked with water after their ceremonial bath. The ascetics have duly offered oblations to the fire in Agnihotra sacrifices and the smoke, tawny like the pigeon's body, emanates wafted by the wind. The trees with sparse leaves all over have grown dense, the quarters in the distant region are no longer discernible by the senses. The night rangers have started moving everywhere and the deer in the penance  grove are beginning to sleep around the sacred altars. O Sita, adorned with stars, the night has commenced. You can see the moon rising in the sky spreading his mantle of light. With my permission you may go now and be a companion of Rama. I am thoroughly contented  with your story told so sweetly. O Sita, adorn yourself in my presence. Dear child, permit me the pleasure of  adorning  you with these divine ornaments. Sita, adorned, looked like the daughter of a god. She bowed at the feet of Anasuya in reverence and set out to meet Rama. Rama, the most eloquent among men, saw Sita adorned, and rejoiced at the gifts of love given by the ascetic Anasuya. Sita the princess of Mithila related everything to Rama and showed him the gifts of love given by ascetic Anasuya -- raiment, jewellery and garlands. Rama the great charioteer and Lakshmana were exceedingly gratified to see the honour conferred on Sita, rare among mortals. Thereafter, the descendant of Raghu, whose countenance resembled the Moon, having received the hospitality of the accomplished ascetics, passed that holy night in delight. Night over, the two best men, Rama and Lakshmana, after their ablution took leave of the ascetics inhabiting the forest who offered morning oblations to the fire . The righteous ascetics dwelling in the forest informed both Rama and Lakshmana  that  part of the forest infested by demons. O Rama, this great forest is haunted by carnivorous demons who can assume any form and by blooddrinking wild animals. O Rama, in this great forest demons will devour the  ascetics if they find them impure or intoxicated or indolent. Prevent them. O Rama, this is the one path in the forest used by the ascetics to gather fruits. You can safely cross the otherwise impassable forest through this path. The ascetics offered their blessings to Rama the tormentor of enemies. Thereafter, accompanied by his wife and Lakshmana, he entered the great forest like the Sun entering the mass of clouds.         Thus ends the hundrednineteenth sarga in Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki."

                "The invincible and selfpossessed Rama entered the great forest of Dandaka and saw there a multitude of hermitages of the ascetics. They (the hermitages) were strewn all over with kusa grass and robes by bark with auspicious sacrificial materials around and hence dazzling like the orb of the sun in the sky difficult to gaze. The courtyards (of the hermitages) were cleanswept, sprinkled with water and decorated. They provided shelter to all kinds of creatures and were filled all over with  flocks of birds and antelopes. The hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels. They were  adorned with vast fire sanctuaries, ladles for sacrificial ceremonies, deerskins and kusa grass faggots for pots of water, roots and fruits. They looked delightful with huge sacred trees of the forest laden with sweet fruits. The hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels.

Flowers were scattered all over. There was a lotuspond with lotuses.

There were aged, selfrestrained sages glowing like the Sun or the fire, living on fruits and roots, clothed in bark and dark  deerskin. The hermitages echoing with  the sounds of Vedic recitations and resembling the very abode of Brahma were adorned with great, holy sages living on regulated diet. The illustrious, effulgent Rama saw groups of hermitages adorned with venerable brahmins, with knowledge of the Supreme Spirit. On seeing them he loosened the string of his great bow and went forward. On seeing Rama with illustrious Sita, the great sages, richly endowed with divine knowledge, went forward to greet him. The sages, steadfast in their vows, saw Rama who was shining like the rising Moon, Lakshmana and the famed Sita went forward and received them with words of benediction. The sages, steadfast in their vows, saw Rama who was shining like the rising Moon, Lakshmana and the famed Sita went forward and received them with words of benediction. Those sages living  in the forest were wonderstruck to see the handsome, graceful, delicate and welldressed Rama. All the foresters looked at the wonderful figures of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana with unblinking eyes. Ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, the sages made Rama, their guest, sit in their leafy hut. The great sages comparable to the firegod and followers of righteousness honoured Rama  according to tradition by offering water. The sages who were knowers of dharma saluted the noble Rama, offered fruits, roots and flowers available  at the hermitage and with folded palms said thus: O king of great reputation, you are the refuge of the people, a protector of dharma, a chastiser of wrongdoers, a worshipful and respectable preceptor. O Rama, in this world a king is considered the fourth part of Indra as he protects the people. Therefore, he is respected and he enjoys the choicest pleasures of life. Since we are the residents of your territory we deserve to be protected by you. Whether you live in the city or in the forest, you are the lord of the people and our king. O king, we have conquered our anger and have controlled our senses. We ascetics have cast aside all our authority. We are like your children and need to be protected by you forever Having said so, the ascetics offered with reverence fruits, roots, flowers and other forest  products to Rama and Lakshmana.",
                "After receiving hospitality from the sages, Rama took of all of them at sunrise and entered deep into the forest. With Lakshmana following, Rama went through the forest, filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers. It was a place where trees, creepers and bushes were crushed (by frequent visits of demons). It was difficult to locate a water source.  And it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects (crickets). With Lakshmana following, Rama went through the forest, filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers. It was a place where trees, creepers and bushes were crushed (by frequent visits of demons). It was difficult to locate a water source.  And it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects (crickets). While Rama along with Sita was wandering in the forest infested with  dreadful animals, he saw a roaring cannibal resembling the peak of a mountain. He was of dreadful appearance with deep eyes, a huge face and a big belly. He looked tall, ugly and frightening. Wearing a tigerskin, he resembled the god of death. With a wide, open mouth, wet with marrow and drenched with blood, he struck terror into  all beings. Roaring loudly, he carried an iron spit in which were pierced three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten deer  and the huge head of an elephant with its tusks smeared with the fat of flesh. Looking extremely furious, he ran towards Rama, Lakshmana and Sita like the god of death rushes towards the (dying) people. Making a dreadful sound, as if shaking the earth, he took Sita on his lap, stepped aside and said: You both clad in bark and wearing matted hair, holding bows, arrows and swords have entered into the Dandaka forest with your wife. Your life has been cut short indeed How is it that you both, dressed in the robes of ascetics, live  with a woman? Leading an unrighteous and sinful life, who are you who have brought disgrace to the ascetic discipline ? I am a demon named Viradha. I move in this dense forest with my weapons eating the flesh of the sages. This  woman of fine hips shall be my wife. You sinners I shall drink  the blood of both of you in the fight. Sita, daughter of Janaka was bewildered out of fear when she heard the cruel  and boastful words of that wicked Viradha. Seeing the auspicious Sita in the lap of Viradha shaken out of anxiety, like a plantain tree in a strong wind, Rama with his throat parched said to Lakshmana: Seeing the auspicious Sita in the lap of Viradha shaken out of anxiety, like a plantain tree in a strong wind, Rama with his throat parched said to Lakshmana: Gentle Lakshmana, see the illustrious daughter ofJanaka, a lady of good conduct,  brought up in utmost comfort caught in the lap of Viradha O Lakshmana whatever Kaikeyi desired through her boons has now come true so soon. Kaikeyi, my middle mother is farsighted indeed  Not content with the kingdom alone see sent me, beloved of all  beings, away to the forest. Let her cherished desire be fulfilled. Kaikeyi, my middle mother is farsighted indeed  Not content with the kingdom alone see sent me, beloved of all  beings, away to the forest. Let her cherished desire be fulfilled. O Lakshmana nothing is more sorrowful to me than the touch of Vaidehi by another. It is more painful to me than the death of my father or loss of my kingdom. As Rama was thus full of tears of sorrow, Lakshmana sighed heavily in anger like a hissing serpant in confinement. And said: O Rama, you are, like Indra, lord of all beings. What makes you feel sad like an orphan when I am at your service like a servant? The earth will drink the blood of Viradha with his life gone, slain by my angry arrow. Like Indra who hits the mountain with his thunderbolt, I shall release on Viradha the anger I felt against Bharata for his passion for the kingdom. Spurred by the speed of my strong arms, my arrow will fall on his broad chest and separate his life from his body. Then his body reeling round and round will fall on the ground.       Thus ends the second sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Graceful Lakshmana asked  Viradha  with a smile, Who are you wandering in the forest at will ?. Then Viradha with his voice filling the forest said, Instead of asking about me you both should speak out who  you are and where you are going Questioned by the demon, who bore a burning countenance, the highly effulgent Rama introduced his Ikshvaku family: Know us to be both kshatriyas, endowed with a good lineage and yet moving in the forest. We both wish to know, who you are and why you are going about in Dandaka forest? Then Viradha said to Rama whose truth was his strength, I will tell you who I am. O, listen: I am indeed son to Jaya. My mother is Satahrada. Verily all the demons on this earth call me Viradha. By the grace of Lord Brahma I was bestowed with this prowess through my penance. In this world none can kill me with a weapon nor split nor cut me to pieces. Therefore, leave this lady and run away to the place you came from. I will not take away your life . With eyes reddened with anger Rama replied to the sinful, deformed Viradha: O vile, mean creature  surely you are seeking death. Wait, you will meet it in the fight. Then Rama strung his bow immediately, shot the sharp arrows at Viradha and hit him verily. From his bow  strung tight,  Rama shot seven swift, goldenfeathered arrows comparable to Garuda  and the Windgod in speed. The arrows tied with peacockfeathers, looking like fire, pierced the body of Viradha which, drenched in blood, fell on the ground. Hit  by Rama and Lakshmana, the enraged  demon left Vaidehi, lifted a sharp spear   and ran towards them. The demon who produced a great noise with his wide open mouth resembled the god of death. He lifted a sharp spike that looked like Indra's banner. And then both the brothers showered bright arrows on the demon Viradha who looked like Yama, the god of death. The demon who was extremely frightening stood there, laughing and yawning.  As he yawned, all the swiftlyflying arrows fell out of his body. By virtue of a boon Viradha, the demon, controlled the vital breath of his body by a mere touch and, raising the spike, ran towards the two Raghava princes. With two arrows, Rama, the best among wielders of weapons, broke down the spike in the sky burning like fire, and resembling the  thunderbolt of Indra. The spike, broken down by Rama's arrow, fell like a slab of mount Meru splintered by Indra's thunder. Then both Rama and Lakshmana quickly raised their swords which looked like black serpents and at once fell upon the demon who was going to strike with great force. Struck down, the angry demon tightly caught hold of both of them under his arms and wanted to set out, carrying Rama and Lakshmana, the two unshakeable tigers among men. Rama understood the intention of the demon and said to Lakshmana, Let him go his way, no need to stop him. O Lakshmana, let the nightstalker go the way he wishes. That is, in fact, our path. Puffed up with his own great strength, Viradha lifted them and placed them on his shoulders as though they were two children. Then the nightstalker proceeded towards the forest, carrying both the scions of the Raghu race on his shouldersroaring.",
                "Seeing those two mightyarmed Rama and Lakshmana being carried away by Viradha, Sita started crying loudly: The wild bears, tigers and panthers will eat me up here. O best among demons, pray take me and leave both the Kakutsthas. On hearing those words of  Sita, both the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana hastened to kill the wicked Viradha. Lakshmana quickly broke the left and Rama the right shoulder of that dreadful demon. With both shoulders broken, the demon, looking like a cloud (huge and dark) fell at once on the ground like a mountain split by a thunderbolt. Striking the demon with fists, knees and feet, both of them smit him  on the bare ground and pulverized him. Although pierced by arrows, and wounded by the two swords, and pulverized on the ground, the demon did not die. Seeing the mountainlike Viradha not dying though seriously wounded, illustrious Rama, guaranter of safety from fear said to Lakshmana: O Lakshmana, best among men, this demon by virtue of his penance cannot be killed with any weapon in war. Therefore, let us bury him. Dig a deep pit to bury this demon, dreadful like an elephant and emitting a fearful glow. Courageous Rama standing there put his foot firmly on the neck of Viradha and said to Lakshmana,' Dig up a crevice'. When the demon Viradha heard Rama saying so, he said these humble words to the scion of the Kakutsthas and the best of men : You have killed me, O Rama, a tiger among men. You are equal to Indra in prowess. O best of men, out of delusion I could not recognise you earlier. O dear Rama, I know now you are the blessed son of Kausalya, Sita is a noble lady and a glorious soul. I am Tumburu by name,  a celestial singer of the gandharva clan. Cursed by Kubera, I got this dreadful body of a demon. When I appealed to him, that lord of great fame (Kubera) said that I would get back my original form and ascend to heaven when Rama, son of Dasaratha, would kill me in a duel. When king Kubera saw me absent (from duty) as I was infatuated with Rambha, he got angry and cursed me. O scorcher of enemies by your grace I am rid of the curse. Delivered from my dreadful form, I will now go to my world. May both of you fare well. O dear, there lives Sarabhanga, a righteous sage, comparable to the Sun, at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here. Go to him at once. He will bless you with your wellbeing. O dear, there lives Sarabhanga, a righteous sage, comparable to the Sun, at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here. Go to him at once. He will bless you with your wellbeing. Bury me in the pit, O Rama, and proceed happily. This is a great tradition for the dead demons. Those who are buried in the pit attain heaven. Having said so to Rama, the mighty  Viradha, hit by the arrows left his body and attained heaven. When Rama heard those words, he said, O Lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts, a big pit. Having said so the mighty Rama stood firmly stamping the neck of Viradha with his foot. When Rama heard those words, he said, O Lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts, a big pit. Having said so the mighty Rama stood firmly stamping the neck of Viradha with his foot. Then Lakshmana fetched a spade and dug a sufficiently big pit by the side of the great soul Viradha. Rama took his foot off Viradha's neck and dropped his body with pointed ears into the pit while Viradha was groaning fearfully Rama and Lakshmana, stable and firm, brave and quick, together lifted the body of Viradha who was fierce in battle and roaring and forcibly threw it into the pit with joy. The two princes, bulls among men, who were adept in archery saw that the great demon could not be killed by any other means. They reflected over the issue  and undertook the task of killing him with sharp weapons and buried him in a pit. Rama deliberately wanted to kill Viradha with weapons. Viradha the forestranger himself revealed that it was not possible to kill him with weapons and asked Rama to bury him in a pit. While Rama, who had made up his mind after hearing him, was putting the mighty demon in the pit, the forest rang with his roar. Rama and Lakshmana were happy to consign Viradha's body to the pit after killing him. They filled the pit with rocks in the great forest without fear.",
                "On killing Viradha, the demon of terrific strength, heroic Rama embraced Sita, consoled her and said to his brother Lakshmana, glowing like fire: This wild forest with which we have not been acquainted earlier is difficult  to pass. (Hence) let us proceed quickly to sage Sarabhanga. Rama went to the hermitage of Sarabhanga, a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme (by his penance). Thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder. Rama went to the hermitage of Sarabhanga, a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme (by his penance). Thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder. Rama saw the lord of the gods (Indra) in the sky getting off the chariot, with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire, followed by the gods, his feet untouched by the earth. Clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments, he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him. Rama saw the lord of the gods (Indra) in the sky getting off the chariot, with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire, followed by the gods, his feet untouched by the earth. Clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments, he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him. Not far from that place, Rama saw a chariot, yoked with tawnycoloured horses, shining like the morning  Sun. It looked like a palewhite cloud, resembling the lunar orb. Not far from that place, Rama saw a chariot, yoked with tawnycoloured horses, shining like the morning  Sun. It looked like a palewhite cloud, resembling the lunar orb. Rama saw a pure white umbrella with a highly expensive golden staff, decorated with variegated flower garlands.While near his (Indra's) head stood a pair of exquisite ladies with fans made of yak's tail. Many celestial singers of heaven, gods, great sages and siddhas sang with the choicest words the glory of this god stationed in the sky. While Indra was conversing with Sarabhanga, Rama saw him and said to Lakshmana. Pointing at the chariot, Rama said, Lakshmana, see this wonderful, effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the Sun in the sky. Pointing at the chariot, Rama said, Lakshmana, see this wonderful, effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the Sun in the sky. The horses of Indra, who is often invoked (during sacrificial rituals) and about whom  we have heard earlier, are now stationed in the sky. O Lakshmana  around the chariot stand hundreds of finest young men of about twentyfive years. Clad in red robes, they are wearing earrings, and holding swords in their hands. They have broad chests and stout arms like iron beams. Like tigers, they are difficult to overpower. They have necklaces hanging on their chests blazing like fire.

These tigers among men have cheerful countenacess from which it can be deduced that the age of the gods always remains constant. Lakshmana, stay here with Sita awhile, until I ascertain who this dazzling being on the chariot is. Instructing Lakshmana to wait , Rama  went towards Sarabhanga's hermitage. Then Indra (husband of Sachi) having seen Rama coming towards him, approached Sarabhanga and said this to him privately: Here comes Rama. Before he talks to me, take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me. He has to do a great task which is difficult for others. I can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious. Here comes Rama. Before he talks to me, take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me. He has to do a great task which is difficult for others. I can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious. This way honouring the sage Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, took leave of him and went to heaven in his chariot harressed with horses. When Indra departed like that, Rama with his retinue (Sita and Lakshmana) went to Sarabhanga who was sitting by the side of the firealtar (for Agnihotra). Rama, Sita and Lakshmana prostrated at Sarabhanga's feet. After being permitted to sit, they were invited to stay there. Thereafter on Rama's query Sarabhanga told him all about Indra's visit: O Rama, Indra, the bestower of boons, wants to take me to the world of Brahma,  earned by me through severe penance which is most difficult to be attained by those devoid of selfrealisation. O Rama, the best among men you are a very dear guest to me and knowing that you are near, I will not go to the world of Brahman without seeing you. O Rama, the best of men  (only) after seeing a great, virtuous soul like you shall I go to heaven, the abode of the gods. O tiger among men, I have conquered heavenly abodes as well as the imperishable, auspicious worlds of Brahma. Accept them all that are mine (obtained through my penance) To these words of sage Sarabhanga Rama, the best of men, the knower of all sastras, the scion of the Raghus replied: O great sage, I will earn all the worlds myself if you direct me. But I need a proper dwellingplace in this forest. To this request of Rama who was equal to Indra in strength, sagacious Sarabhanga said these words: Here dwells in this forest a brilliant saint, righteous and selfcontrolled, Sutikshna by name who will look to your welfare, O Rama You may approach sage, Sutikshna residing in a sacred spot. He will provide you a delightful place for your stay in the forest. Proceed, O Rama  in the reverse direction of the river Mandakini carrying flowers and floats. And you will reach the place. O Rama, the best among men, this is the way. Look at me for a while, my dear, until I shed my limbs just as a snake sheds its withered slough. Then the effulgent Sarabhanga, knower of mantras (magical spells) kindled the fire with faggots and after offering oblations of ghee plunged in. Then were consumed that highsouled Sarabhanga's hair on the body and on the head, the wornout skin, the bones and flesh along with blood. Sarabhanga then emerged youthful from that heap of fire, shining like a flame and looking very elegant Sarabhanga then went beyond the worlds of the gods, of the great sages who constantly kindle sacrificial fire, and ascended to the world of Brahman. Sarabhanga, performer of sacred deeds, saw Brahma with his followers Brahma also seeing Sarabhanga, the best among the brahmins,  welcomed him gladly.        Thus ends the fifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Sarabhanga attained the heaven, all the sages collected together and came to Rama whose radiance was like fire.

All groups of sages, who knew dharma, and were upholders of righteousness reached Rama, the supreme knower of dharma, and said: O great charioteer you are the lord of the Ikshvaku race and of the world just like Indra, chief among the gods. You are renowned in the three worlds for your valour, for your devotion to father, and in you lies enough evidence of your adherence to truth and righteousness. O lord, do excuse us. We sought your help to fulfil our needs since you are at hand. You are a great soul, knower and lover of dharma. O Lord, a king who collect one sixth of the produce as tax and yet does not protect his subjects like his children commits an act of grave injustice. O Rama, whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of Brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter. O Rama, whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of Brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter. One fourth of the supreme merit a sage earns by living on fruits and roots, accrues to the king through which the people are protected righteously. O Rama  we are a group of great sages, mostly brahmins, leading a vanaprastha  life. Yet with a protector like you, we are slaughtered in large numbers like orphans. Come and see  the bodies of ascetics, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit, killed in large numbers in the forest by the fierce demons. A great slaughter is taking place amongst those residing on the bank of the Pampa lake, near the river Mandakini, and on mount Chitrakuta. We ascetics are not able to tolerate the fearful deeds perpetrated by the dreadful demons in the forest. O Rama, you are worthy of refuge. Hence we have come to you seeking your protection. We are being killed by the nightstalkers. Save us. O great warrior here on this earth there is no protector as mighty as you. So, O prince  save us all from these demons. Having heard this, righteous Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty said to all the ascetics engaged in penance: You should not speak to me this way. I deserve to be commanded by the ascetics. I have not entered this forest only on a personal mission. I came into this forest in obedience to my father's orders to repel the aggression of demons against you. I came here to acomplish your task incidentally, Therefore, my stay in the forest will yield great results. I wish to kill in the fight the demons who are your enemies. O great ascetics, you may  witness my prowess supported by my brother. Brave Rama, steadfast in righteousness, worthy of honour, gave assurance to protect the ascetics endowed with the wealth of penance, and proceeded towards sage Sutikshna.       Thus ends the sixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, the scorcher of enemies, along with his brother Lakshmana and Sita and the sages went to Sutikshna's hermitage. After covering a long distance and crossing the river (Ganga) with plenty of water, Rama saw a huge mountain looking like a lofty cloud. Rama and Lakshmana, the best of the Ikshvaku family, accompanied by Sita entered the dense forest  filled with trees all over. Entering that dreadful forest, they saw trees full of flowers and fruits, and a hermitage in a lonely place with lines of bark robes hanging. There at the hermitage was Sutikshna, an ascetic grown old with (long) penance, wearing soiled, matted locks and seated. Rama (first) addressed him as per custom. O venerable one, I am Rama.You are a great sage, armed with truth as your prowess and a knower of dharma. I have come to see you. Could you speak to me? Thereafter the composed Sutikshna, looked at Rama, the best among righteous men, and embracing him with both his arms said: O Rama, the best among the Raghavas and among the upholders of truth, you are welcome. With your presence this hermitage will have a protector now. O renowned hero, I had heard that you have come to Chitrakuta, renouncing your kingdom. I have been waiting so long to see you here. Unable to give up this body, I did not even leave the earth for heaven, the world of the gods. O scion of the Kakutstha family, Indra, king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds I have won all the worlds. O scion of the Kakutstha family, Indra, king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds I have won all the worlds. Along with your wife and Lakshmana you may roam by my grace the worlds won by me and served by divine sages like devarsi Narada. Selfpossessed Rama replied to the truthful ascetic who had performed intense penance. Just as Kasyapa would address Lord Brahma: O great sage I will win all the worlds myself. I (only) want to live in this forest. Allow me. You are ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. I have heard this from the great sage Sarabhanga of Gautama's clan. Thus addressed by  Rama, Sutikshna, the great sage, wellknown to the world was highly delighted. He (then) said these sweet words: O Rama this is a salubrious hermitage where hosts of sages live and which is full of roots and fruits, you may enjoy yourself here. O illustrious Rama, herds of animals visit this place fearlessly, enticing the inmates and (then) go back without harming any one. When heroic Rama heard that there was no other problem from the wild animals except their frequent incursions, he lifted his bow with an arrow and said these words: O reverend one, I will kill with a sharpedged arrow, glowing like a thunderbolt, all those herds of animals who keep coming here. What can be more agonizing for you (than my killing animals). I (therefore) do not foresee our long stay in this hermitage. Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna. Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna. Seeing that the evening had passed and night had set in, the great sage Sutikshna with due hospitality, served those best of men, food fit for ascetics.       Thus ends the seventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, worshipped by Sutikshna and accompanied by Lakshmana, spent the night at the hermitage, and got up early in the morning. In the morning Rama and Sita got up in time and took bath in cool, lilyfragrant water. And as per routine, sinless Sita, Rama and Lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics. Seeing the rising Sun, they worshipped him, and approaching Sutikshna,  said these soothing words: And as per routine, sinless Sita, Rama and Lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics. Seeing the rising Sun, they worshipped him, and approaching Sutikshna,  said these soothing words: O revered Sutikshna received by one so worshipworthy like you, we spent the night well. We (now)take leave of you. The sages  are hastening us. We wish to see the entire circle of hermitages of the sages, residing in Dandaka forest. So we are in a hurry. We seek your permission to go with the great sages, who are ever engaged in righteousness, selfcontrolled by virtue of their penance, and are like flameless fire. We wish to depart before the Sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means (becomes arrogant). Thereafter Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage. We wish to depart before the Sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means (becomes arrogant). Thereafter Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage. When both Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet of Sutikshna, the best of the sages, he lifted them up, hugged them tightly, and said affectionately: You may safely tread, O Rama, this path along with Lakshmana and Sita who is following you like a shadow. O valient Rama the sages, living in  the Dandaka forest, are self realised souls. See how delightful is the location of their hermitages. You will see the beautiful forestareas with abundant fruits and roots, flowers in full bloom, herds of animals, flocks of quiet birds tanks and lakes filled  with clean waters and shining with fully blossomed lotuses, resounding with waterducks and peacocks  and waterfalls coming down the hills. Thus you will enjoy a delightful sylvan sight.

Thus addressed, Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas along with Lakshmana circumambulated the sage (in reverence) and set forth. Thereafter largeeyed Sita handed the brothers two quivers, two bows as well as two excellent swords. Both Rama and Lakshmana  tied their auspicious quivers, took the two twanging bows and departed from the hermitage. Handsome Rama and Lakshmana, glowing in their radiance held the bows and exited  with Sita.

                "While Rama was leaving with the permission of Sutikshna, Sita spoke these warm, affectionate words to her husband: This great path of dharma you are following now can be attained only through subtle means by one free from addiction born of passion. There are three kinds of vices born out of lust. First, speaking untruth, second, having sexual relation with others' wives and third, resorting to violence with no enmity. The later two vices are of serious nature. O Rama you never spoke untruth in the past nor will you speak in future. How can there be any desire in you to destroy the virtue of others' wives ? O Rama, lord among men, you hadn't it (lust for other women) in the past. You havn't it now. Never does it exist even in your mind. O prince, you are always faithful to your wife. You are righteous, truthful and obedient to your father's orders. O Rama, you are truthful, honourable, powerful. O elder brother of Lakshmana, in you is established truth and righteousness. O longarmed one, to contain all this is only possible for those who have conquered the senses. O handsome one, I know your ability to control the senses. (But) you are a victim to the third (vice born of lust) i.e. showing violence without cause for enmity O valiant one, you have promised to kill the demons in the battle, in order to protect the sages residing in the Dandaka forest. It is only on account of this that you entered the wellknown Dandaka forest with your brother wielding bow and arrows. I am, therefore, worried in my mind when I see you here and think of your wellbeing. I wish your ultimate good. The next two lines appear, more or less, a repetition. So omitted : Editor O brave Rama, I do not like your going to Dandaka forest. I shall tell you the reason. Do listen. O brave Rama, I do not like your going to Dandaka forest. I shall tell you the reason. Do listen. Of course, you will go to the forest with your brother, holding the bow and arrows. Release the arrows when you see the forestrangers. A bow in the hand of a kshatriya is like fuel to fire. It surely swells his strength and his brilliance. O mightyarmed one, there dwelt in the past an ascetic, noble and truthful in a sacred forest where animals and birds lived merrily together. Once Indra, husband of Sachi, came to his hermitage in the guise of an attendant, sword in hand, in order to hinder his penance. Then while the sage was practising penance at the hermitage, he gave him that excellent sword to be kept in trust. Having received the weapon as a trust, the sage went wandering in the forest, always attentive in safeguarding the weapon. Vigilant about protecting the sword deposited with him, the sage never moved without it even when he went gathering roots and fruits. While the sage moved about holding the weapon, he gave up the practice of penance gradually and developed a violent mindset. By association with the sword, he developed a violent attitude. And in that habitual state of excitement he was dragged into unrighteous ways which (ultimately) took him to hell. Contact with the weapon has led to this in the past. Like contact with fire, it leads man to destruction. I say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction. Contact with the weapon has led to this in the past. Like contact with fire, it leads man to destruction. I say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction. While holding a bow, you should not have the intention to kill demons residing in Dandaka with no animosity against you. O valiant one  I do not desire that any one should be killed without incurring any offence. It is the duty of a kshatriya, a warrior to protect with his bow those who practise selfcontrol (penance) in the forest in a state of panic. Where is the question of wielding a weapon and living in the forest, where is the life of a kshatriya and the life of penance? For us, this is an encroachment. Let the law of the land be honoured. Lord, when we handle the weapon, the mind gets vitiated. (Only) after returning to Ayodhya can you perform the duty of a kshatriya. You would have been on unlimited source of joy to my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw had you permanently renounced the kingdom for the life of an ascetic. Righteousness brings wealth. Wealth brings happiness. Righteousness brings everything. In fact, the essence of the world is righteousness. The wise earn dharma through getting their bodies emaciated by carefully adopting different means of discipline (selftorture). Happiness does not beget happiness. O gentle one you may move in this forest of ascetics with a pure mind. The true meaning behind everything in these three worlds is known to you, indeed.",
                "Having heard these words spoken by Sita who was devoted to her husband, replied Rama who was firm in righteousness. O daughter of Janaka, you are conversant with dharma. Whatever you have admonished out of affection for me is befitting your race. But permit me, Devi, you have already stated, when a kshatriya holds a bow there will be no cry of distress. (it means you approve of my holding a bow) O Sita, the sages who perform rigorous penance in Dandaka forest came to me personally, seeking shelter although they can be their own protection. The sages living in the forest, eating roots and fruits and ever engaged in righteous activities are afraid of the depredations of the demons, with their happiness gone. The sages engrossed in various austerities in the forest have been victims to the dreadful demons living on human flesh. The ascetics, the best of brahmins living in Dandaka forest being eaten up like that besought me to come to their rescue. On hearing the words that came from their mouth, I bowed at their feet and said: Be pleased  That brahmins like you have approached me while I should have come to you has put me to shame immeasurable . I enquired about what I could do for them. And all the brahmins in one voice said:. 'O Rama, the demons who can assume any form at their will are mercilessly tormenting us in Dandaka forest. Do protect us from them'. 'O sinless one, these cannibals are invincible. They arrive at the time of our sacrificial rituals, on the days of festivities or at the time of lunar conjunctions like no moon or full moon days and attack us. 'You are the supreme refuge for us ascetics, tormented by demons, helpless men in search of shelter. 'O Rama it is difficult to perform penance which is ever full of obstacles. Therefore, we do not pronounce curses even if eaten up by demons'. 'The demons, dwelling in the Dandaka forest are tormenting us. You alone are our lord in the forest. Do protect us with your brother.' O daughter of Janaka, on hearing the words of the sages I promised to undertake the entire protection of sages of the Dandaka forest. Having promised the sages, I cannot do otherwise as long as I have life in me. To me truth is always dear. O Sita I may forfeit my life forsake, even Lakshmana and you but will not break the promise made specially to the brahmins Even before the sages requested me I should have protected them. What to speak of the promise I have already made ? O sinless one all that has been said by you is out of your love and affection for me. I am pleased. What is harmful is never advised. Your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage. You are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life. Having said this to Sita, the princess of Mithila, Rama along with Lakshmana, bow in hand, moved about the delightful penancegrove.       Thus ends the tenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama walked in front, Sita with a beautiful waist, in the middle and Lakshmana holding the bow, behind them Both Rama and Lakshmana walked on, accompanied by Sita, watching several beautiful mountain ranges, forests  and rivers. (Watching) the swans and ruddy geese on river banks and lakes full of lotuses, and birds on water and in the sky. (Watching) herds of deer, intoxicated horned buffaloes, wild boars and elephants who are enemies of trees (elephants uproof trees). As the Sun was setting, they had covered a long distance, watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses, and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes, swans and aquatic animals. As the Sun was setting, they had covered a long distance, watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses, and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes, swans and aquatic animals. In that lake of clear waters they heard the sounds of songs and musical instruments, while there were none around. Out of curiosity, mighty Rama, and Lakshmana started enquiring about the matter from sage Dharmabrata by name: O great sage, this very wonderful sound, has whetted our great curiosity. If there is no top secret about this, do disclose it. Thus addressed by Rama, the righteous sage narrated the entire origin of the lake. O Rama this lake called Panchapsara  filled with water at all times has been created through penance by a sage called Mandakarni. Great sage Mandakarni standing in water and living on air performed  rigorous penance for ten thousand years. Thereafter very much perturbed, all the gods led by Agni gathered together at one place and started deliberating among themselves. 'The gods of heaven became agitated in their minds thinking the sage might usurp one of their places. All the gods then engaged five of the important nymphs, glittering like lightning, to disturb the penance of the sage. The sage, a knower of the inner self and the world of plurality, was gripped by passion for the apsaras, who had come to achieve the target of the gods. The five apsaras, got the status of wives to the sage who built them an invisible home inside the lake. The apsaras lived happily with the sage who remained youthful by virtue of his penance. While the apsaras played their musical instruments, their melodious songs mingled with the sounds of ornaments are heard. Glorious Rama and his brother heard the wonderful words of the selfrealised sage and exclaimed, 'How strange ' When the sage Dharmabrata was telling the story, Rama saw a hermitage strewn all over with kusa grass and bark garments, and endowed with pure brahminic grace. Illustrious Rama accompanied by Vaidehi and Lakshmana entered the hermitage and, honoured by all the sages, stayed there. Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race, wielder of great weapons, stayed in that beautiful hermitage, accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour, He visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay. Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race, wielder of great weapons, stayed in that beautiful hermitage, accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour, He visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay. Rama lived happily here for about ten months, there one year, here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another. Rama lived happily here for about ten months, there one year, here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another. Thus enjoying their stay in the hermitages, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spent ten favourable years. Rama went round who was full of grace and full of knowledge on dharma went round with Sita and came back to Suthikshna's hermitage. On his arrival, Rama, the subduer of enemies, was honoured by the sages at the hermitage where he stayed for a short time. Once while sitting beside sage Sutikshna at the hermitage Rama humbly addressed him: I have heard others saying that lord Agastya, the great sage, lives in this forest. I am unable to locate the sacred hermitage of that sagacious sage due to the vastness of this forest. By your grace, I wish to go there with Sita and my brother Lakshmana to offer our respectful salutations. There is a great desire  in my heart to serve in person the best of sages, Agastya. Hearing the words of Rama, the righteous son of Dasaratha, sage Sutikshna was pleased to reply: I also wished you, O Raghava, to visit Agastya along with Sita and Lakshmana. Luckily you have asked me on your own. I will tell you where the great sage Agastya lives. Dear Rama, walk from here a distance of four yojanas. There in the southerly direction  stands the great, beautiful hermitage of Agastya's brother. This plain land in the beautiful forest tract is adorned with fig trees,filled with  flowers, fruits, and delightful sounds of different birds. O Rama, there are lotusponds filled with clear, sacred waters, with different kinds of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. Spend one night there and proceed early in the morning. O Rama, there are lotusponds filled with clear, sacred waters, with different kinds of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. Spend one night there and proceed early in the morning. If you go in the southern direction for a yojana you will find Agasthya's hermitage by the side of a cluster of trees. Vaidehi will feel happy in your company in that delightful forest region full of many trees.So too will Lakshmana. O glorious one, if you have made up your mind to visit that great sage Agastya, think of starting today itself. Rama heard the words of the sage, offered him reverential salutations and set out along with his brother and Sita. Enjoying the sight of delightful forests, cloudlike mountains, lakes and rivers on the  way, and following the directions given by  Sutikshna, Rama was happy. He said  to Lakshmana: Enjoying the sight of delightful forests, cloudlike mountains, lakes and rivers on the  way, and following the directions given by  Sutikshna, Rama was happy. He said  to Lakshmana: Surely this is the hermitage of great Agastya's brother, a man of holy deeds. This is the glade we were told about with thousands of trees drooping down with abundant fruits and flowers. Feel this sudden astringent smell of ripe figs wafted by the breeze from the forest. Heaps of firewood are seen here and there on the path. There are blades of grass (used for sacrificial ceremonies) shining like vaidurya (gems). In the middle of the forest can be seen like the tip of the dark clouds columns of smoke coming out of the top of hermitages. Priests are coming out of the solitary sacred spots after their bath and making offerings of flowers they had themselves plucked. O handsome one, surely this is the hermitage of Agastya's brother about which I heard from Sutikshna. Assuming the form of a brahmin and using Sanskrit language, Ilvala would invite brahmins for offering shraddha to the dead Ilvala would keep his brother sanctified, so that he is fit for offering, Then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals. Ilvala would keep his brother sanctified, so that he is fit for offering, Then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals. Then when the brahmins finished eating, Ilvala would call aloud, 'O Vatapi come out'. Then hearing his brother's voice, Vatapi would bleat like a sheep and jump out, tearing open the bodies of those brahmins. In this manner, thousands of brahmins used to be killed daily by those carnivorous demons who assumed any form at their free will. Urged by the gods, Agastya  came  for the shradda . The mighty demon played the same routine trick and Vatapi, for sure, was eaten by the great sage. Saying, the ritual is complete Ilvala offered water in the palm of Agastya and called his brother to come out. Wise Agastya,  the best among the ascetics, laughing aloud, said to Ilvala, the destroyer of brahmins: I have digested the demon Vatapi your brother, who assumed the form of a sheep. He has reached the abode of Yama, Lord of death. Where does he have the power to come out? On hearing the news of the death of his brother, the demon Ilvala, out of anger, started attacking the sage. Ilvala who pounced upon Agastya, the best among the sages whose lustre lay consumed by the fire of his eyes which were in flames. This hermitage surrounded by beautiful lakes and forests belongs to his brother (Sudarsana). Out of sympathy for Agastya, he has accomplished this difficult task. While Rama was thus narrating to Lakshmana (the story of Agastya), the Sun set and evening closed in. Rama with his brother Lakshmana duly offered oblations at twilight, entered the hermitage and greeted the sage (Sudarsana) with folded palms. Warmly received by the sage, Rama shared the roots and fruits and slept the night there. When the night passed and the Sun became bright, Rama took leave of the brother of Agastya. O Lord, the night has been wellspent. Now we humbly seek leave of you to see your respectable elder brother. With his permission, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, proceeded along the path indicated, watching (the beauty of) the forest. They passed by wild rice fields, jackfruit trees, palmyra and various other trees like Ashoka, trees with white flowers, old trees that existed for a long time, mahva trees, bilva trees and tindukas. Rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys. He saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds. He saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom. Rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys. He saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds. He saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom. Then the lotuseyed Rama said to the chivalrous, graceful Lakshmana who stood behind him: The leaves of the trees here are glossy, the animals and birds are peaceful. It appears the hermitage of the selfrealized great sage Agastya is not very far from here. Here is the hermitage of Agastya, wellknown in the world for his deeds a place of rest for those tired with hard work. This forest is enveloped with the smoke rising from the sacrificial altar. There are rows of bark robes hanging. Herds of quiet animals lying and different kind of birds chirping around. This is his hermitage. On account of his (Agastya's) impact the demons look south but cannot eat the hermits out of fear (for the sage). Since the time Agastya of sacred deeds occupied this direction the demons are quiet, leaving all enmity. The southern side favourable to the people was famous by the name Agastya in the three worlds and stood unassailable to the demons. This is the hermitage of the longlived Agastya who is renowned for his deeds and is served by humble people. The great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya's words.

The great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya's words. We are going to join this sage honoured by the people of the world and ever engaged in the welfare of the virtuous. This augurs well for us. O noble, handsome Lakshmana, I will spend the rest of the exile in this forest in the worship of the great sage Agastya. The gods along with gandharvas, siddhas and great sages always serve Agastya, observing discipine in their food habits. This sage is such type that he (his spiritual power) will not allow a liar or a cruel man or a deceitful or lustful  or wicked person to thrive here. Here gods, yakshas, nagas and birds live, following the righteous path and observing discipline in food habits. Here great souls like sages and siddhas gave up the ghost and with renewed bodies left for heaven on aerochariot resembling the Sun (in brightness). Worshipped by benevolent beings, the gods here bestow on them the status of demigods or of the immortals or several kinds of kingdoms.",
                "Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama,  entered the hermitage of Agastya and met one of his disciples and said to him these words : The valiant eldest son of  king Dasaratha has come along with his wife Sita to see the sage. I am his younger brother Lakshmana, his wellwisher and faithful devotee if you have at all heard about me. By the command of our father, we have entered this dense forest and desire to see the   divine sire. Please report. The ascetic heard Lakshmana, and saying, 'let it be so', entered the firesanctuary to report. Having promptly entered, Agastya's favourite disciple with folded hands reported as he was told by Lakshmana about Rama's arrival to the great sage who was armed with the inviolable powers of penance : Rama and Lakshmana, the two sons of Dasaratha along with Sita, wife of Rama, have arrived at the hermitage. Both the subduers of enemies  have come here now to see and serve your Holiness. You may order what is to be done next. Having heard from the disciple about the arrival of Rama, Lakshmana and great daughter of the king of Videha the sage said : It is good fortune that Rama has come here after a long time to see me. I was longing for his arrival. Go quickly and with due hospitality conduct Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana into my presence. Why was he not ushered in so long? 'So be it ' said the disciple respectfully with folded palms in response to what the great sage, knower of dharma, commanded. Then the disciple in a state of excitement came out of the hermitage and said to Lakshmana, 'Where is Rama? Let him come himself to see the sage'. Then Lakshmana reached the entrance of the hermitage with the disciple  and showed  Rama of the Kakutstha race and Sita, daughter of Janaka . The disciple humbly reported Agastya's words and ushered him in with befitting hospitality. Then Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the hermitage, watching herds of quietly moving deer (undisturbed by their entry). Rama saw at the hermitage, the places (altars) of Brahma, Visnu, Agni (firegod), Indra, Sun, Moon, Bhaga, Kubera, Dhata (supreme spirit), Vidhata (creator Brahman), Vayu (Windgod), Ananta (great serpentking),  Gayatri, Vasu Pasahasta, Varuna, Kartikeya and Dharma .

Thereafter surrounded by the disciples the sage came out. Rama saw him coming in front of the effulgent sages. The valiant Rama said to Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, O Lakshmana, sage Agastya is coming out. By virtue of his noble appearance, I know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances. The valiant Rama said to Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, O Lakshmana, sage Agastya is coming out. By virtue of his noble appearance, I know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances. Having said so, the mightyarmed Rama, the scorcher of enemies, grasped the feet of Agastya who was shining like the Sun. Then righteous Rama with Sita, the princess of Videha, and Lakshmana offered respects with folded palmsstanding. Agastya received Rama by offering him seat and water, enquired about his wellbeing  and said: Please be seated, After giving oblations to the fire, and  providing respectful offerings, the sage worshipped the guests according to the tradition of hermits and served them food. And then the great sage Agastya, knower of dharma  first took his seat and addressed Rama, an export in the knowledge of dharma, seated with folded palms. O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, only  after offering oblations to the Firegod, a guest should be worshipped with water etc. Otherwise the host will have to eat his own flesh in the other world like a false witness. You are king of all the worlds, a follower of dharma, a great warrior worthy of worship and an esteemed self. O Rama you are such a dear guest come to me. Having said this to Rama, (the sage) honoured him by offering fruits, roots, flowers and other things as desired. He then said to Rama once again: O best among men  this divine bow studded with gold and gems  belongs to Visnu and designed by Visvakarma. This excellent, unfailing arrow, bright like the Sun, was given to me by Brahma. O best among men  this divine bow studded with gold and gems  belongs to Visnu and designed by Visvakarma. This excellent, unfailing arrow, bright like the Sun, was given to me by Brahma. These two quivers filled fully with sharp inexhaustible arrows, shining like flames of fire and this sword adorned with gold and this big silver sheath were given to me by Indra. In ancient times Visnu killed the demons in a battle with this bow and brought back the glittering prosperity for the gods. O bestower of honour, receive this bow, the two quivers, the sword and the arrow for your victory just like Indra accepts the thunderbolt. The luminous lord Agastya, having said this, gave all the excellent weapons to Rama. And continued :       Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Rama ,I am pleased. I wish you well. I am glad that both of you have come here with Sita to pay respect to me. Both of you are tired due to the journey. It is evident that Sita, daughter of Janaka, is anxious (to rest). Even though delicate, Sita never feels discouraged by difficulties. She has come to the forest full of obstacles, since she is motivated by her love for her husband. O Rama, help Sita enjoy herself in whatever manner she likes. By following you into the forest, she has accomplished the most difficult task O Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty from the beginning of the creation women, by nature,  keep the husband company when all goes well and give them up when hard times come. Women are fickle like lightning, sharp like weapons and fast like Garuda or the windgod. Your wife is free from such blemishes. She is praiseworthy and worthy of mention as an example just like the revered Arundhati. O Rama, subduer of enemies the place where you reside along with Lakshmana and Vaidehi will look adorned, indeed. Thus addressed, Rama held his palms together and said politely to the sage shining like fire: I consider myself blessed and favoured by a great sage like you, bestower of boons as you have been pleased with me, my brother and my life. Direct me to a place with water and dense forest where we can build an ashram and live happily. On hearing the words of Rama, Agastya, the best among the sages, coolheaded and righteous, thought a while and uttered these words coolly : O dear two yojanas away is a place wellknown as Panchavati, a beautiful resort with many roots, fruits, plenty of water and many animals. Reaching there, you wikk build a hermitage with Lakshmana and enjoy your life given to the fulfilment of the pledge to the father. O Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas  much of the period of exile king Dasaratha had assigned has passed. You will fulfil your promise and live happily in the kingdom. O Rama, joy of the Raghu family with the eldest son like you, your father is blessed and liberated like king Yayati. O sinless one, I have kown all these facts about you by the power of penance and love for Dasaratha. I know your heart by virtue of my penance. I, therefore, ask you to proceed to Panchavati, after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being. I know your heart by virtue of my penance. I, therefore, ask you to proceed to Panchavati, after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being. O Raghava, that forest tract is delightful and beautiful. It is not far away(from here). Maithili (Sita) will enjoy her stay there. O longarmed Rama,that place has plenty of roots and fruits. It is a solitary, holy and beautiful place teeming with various kinds of birds. Sita will enjoy her stay in the vicinity of river Godavari. O Rama, while staying with your wife, you will look after the ascetics living there since you are capable of giving protection. O valiant Rama look at the great forest of madhuka trees. Walk north to the forest till you see a great banyan tree. Then climb the elevated ground not very far from the mountain. There is the wellknown Panchavati with forests, ever in full bloom. Thus addressed by Agastya,  Rama with Lakshmana paid respects to the sage wedded to truth and took leave of him. Both of them worshipped the feet of sage Agastya, and proceeded to Panchavati with his permission. Both the princes, unafraid of battles, held their bows, tied the quivers and carefully proceeded towards Panchavati along the path suggested by the sage.       Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On the way to Panchavati, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, met a vulture with a huge body and fearful strength. Seeing the bird on the banyan tree, venerable Rama and Lakshmana mistook him for a demon and enquired who he was. With a sweet, pleasing, and gentle voice he said to both of them, O dear know me to be a friend of your father. Rama knew he was a friend of his father. So he enquired in a cool, composed voice his name and his lineage. On hearing Rama's words, the bird started narrating the origin of all beings including his own family: O mightyarmed Rama hear from me while I am telling you about the lords of creation from the very beginning. O Rama among the lords of all beings the first was Kardama, the next was Vikritha, followed by Sesha, Samsrya Bahuputra, Sthanu, Mareechi, Atri and mighty Kratu, Pulastya, Angirasa, Pracheta, similarly Pulaha and Daksha.Following them were Vivasvan, Arishtanemi and the very glorious Kasyapa who was the last ruler.

O glorious Rama it is wellknown that Daksha, the creator had sixty daughters of great fame. Out of them(daughters of Daksha) Kasyapa married eight women of beautiful waist called Aditi, Diti, Danu also Kalika,Tamra, Krodhavasa, Anala and Manu. Kasyapa, pleased with them said to his young wives, Beget sons of my stature who can rule over the three worlds. O best of men, O longarmed Rama while Aditi, Diti and Kalika seriously considered his advice, the rest of the wives did not. O Rama, subduer and scorcher of enemies to Aditi were born twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two Asvins, thirtythree deities in all. O dear Rama, Diti bore glorious sons called Daityas and this earth with all the forests and seas belonged to them. O subduer of enemies, to Danu was born Hayagriva and to Kalika, Naraka and Kalaka. To Tamra were born, Krounchi, Bhasi, Syeni, Dhrutharashtri and Suki. Altogether they were five beautiful young maids famous in the world. Krounchi gave birth to owls, Bhasi to Bhasa birds, Synei to bright hawks and vultures, Dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes. Krounchi gave birth to owls, Bhasi to Bhasa birds, Synei to bright hawks and vultures, Dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes. Dhrutharashtri, a female bird of great lustre gave birth to chakravakas too. Suki gave birth to Nata and from Nata, Vinata was born. Be blessed, O Rama O Ramato Krodhavasa were born Mrugi, Mrugamanda, Hari, Bhadramada, Mathangi, Sardooli, Sweta, Surabhi and Surasa, Kadruva and endowed with all virtues. O Ramato Krodhavasa were born Mrugi, Mrugamanda, Hari, Bhadramada, Mathangi, Sardooli, Sweta, Surabhi and Surasa, Kadruva and endowed with all virtues. O best of men, all kinds of animals were born of Mrugi.To Mrugamanda were born bears and chamara (a different kind of deer). To Hari were born lions, and swiftmoving monkeys and to Bhadramada, a daughter by name Iravati. O bull among men Matangi gave birth to elephants.The mighty elephant Airavata who became the lord of the world was born to Iravati. O Rama, Sarduli gave birth to tigers and playful, roundbodied monkeys called Golangula and Sweta delivered elephants as sons for guarding the eight quarters. Surabhi gave birth to Rohini and Gandharvi,the two famous daughters. May you be happy, Rama O Rama Rohini procreated cows, and Gandharvi, horses as offsprings. Surasa delivered cobras and Kadru, ordinary serpents. O Rama, bull among men Manu procreated brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas and sudras all famed human beings. Anala (wife of Kasyapa) procreated trees with sacred fruits. Vinata was the granddaughter of Suki, and Kahdruva and Surasa were her sisters. Kadhru produced a thousandhooded serpent(Adisesha) who held the whole earth on his head and Vinata, two sons, Garuda and Aruna. I am born to Aruna and my elder brother is Sampati. O subduer of enemies, know me as Jatayu, son of Syeni. If you so desire I will be helpful to you in guarding your hut. O dear, it is a difficult forest full of wild animals and demons. When you and Lakshmana are away I will protect Sita. Rama worshipped  Jatayu and bending down, embraced him. He heard from him again and again several events relating to Jatayu's  friendship with his father. Entresting the protection of Sita, the princess of Mithila, to that strong vulture,  Jatayu, and accompanied by Lakshmana Rama went to Panchavati wishing to destroy the enemies like fire burning the moths.       Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On reaching Panchavati, which was full of various vicious animals, Rama said to Lakshmana, his brother who was glowing like  fire: O handsome one, following the directions of the great sage, we have arrived at Panchavati, a place full of blossoming trees. O Lakshmana cast your eyes all around the forest for a suitable place (for building a hermitage).  Indeed, you are good at judging things. Look, O Lakshmana  for a place to the liking of Sita, a place where there is water source nearby  where both of us can enjoy. Find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots, flowers, water and kusa grass are available at hand. Look, O Lakshmana  for a place to the liking of Sita, a place where there is water source nearby  where both of us can enjoy. Find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots, flowers, water and kusa grass are available at hand. Having been thus instructed by Rama, Lakshmana said with folded palms in the presence of Sita: O Rama, I shall be dependent on you, even if I live for a hundred years. You only need to indicate a beautiful place of your choice. Rama was pleased with the words of great Lakshmana. Deliberating over it, he agreed upon a site suitable in all respects. Having come to a beautiful spot suitable for the asram, Rama took both the hands of  Lakshmana in his own and said: This place is level, surrounded by beautiful trees in full bloom. O handsome one, you may build the hermitage here. There, not very far, is a beautiful lotustank shining like the Sun, fragrant with lotuses. As said by the selfrealised soul, sage Agastya, this Godavari is beautiful, surrounded by trees with flowers in bloom, filled with flocks of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. O handsome one, neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer. Their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks. O handsome one, neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer. Their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks. These mountains, with streaks of minerals like gold, silver and copper forming decorative designs, look beautiful like colourful windows, and appear like huge elephants. The place is covered with  sal and palmyrah trees including mango, jackfruit, dates, kadamba, punnaga, ashoka, champak, tilaka, ketaka, sandalwood, spandan, dhava, asvakarna parnasha, khadira, sami, kimsuka and patala trees.

It is full of wild paddy, flowering bushes and creepers that run on the ground. This is a holy place fit for sacrifice. There are many animals and birds here.Hence we will reside here with Jatayu. Thus directed by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana, destroyer  of enemy warriors, soon built a hermitage for his brother. Lakshmana who was quick to act dug the clay with nippers, planted long bamboo poles, put branches of sami trees across and tied them with strong ropes. He spread kusa and kasa grass and leaves on the levelled ground. He built a beautiful, spacious and nice residence for Rama.

Lakshmana then went to river Godavari, had his bath, and returned with some lotuses. Lakshmana offered oblation of flowers, invoked peace as per tradition (before occupying a newly made home) and showed Rama the cottage he had built. Rama and Sita saw the beautiful hermitage built by Lakshmana, and expressed much happiness over the leafthatched cottage. Deeply pleased with Lakshmana, he hugged him tightly and said those loving words : O my master, you have done a great task for which I have given you what I could give at the moment a hug. O Lakshmana with a son like you who can understand others' feelings, who has a sense of gratitude and a sense of duty my father is not dead yet. Rama who was an enhancer of fortunes and who had his senses under control said thus to Lakshmana and lived happily there in that place filled with fruits. Righteous Rama, served by Lakshmana, and Sita lived there for some time like a god in heaven.       Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While the great self Rama  lived happily there, autumn passed and dear winter set in. Once Rama, delight of the Raghu race, went to the beautiful river Godavari for ablution in the early hours of the morning. While valiant Lakshmana, walking behind Sita who was carrying a pitcher in her hand bent down a little and told Rama thus: O sweetspeaking brother, the season which is dear to you has arrived. It appears the auspicious year is going to be embellished with this season. People feel frozen with fog, and water is no more enjoyable. The earth is full of crops and fire is so agreeable. Pious men offer their libations of the first crop at Agnistoma sacrifice and thereby please their manes and get rid of their sins. People in the countryside with their desires satisfied obtain abundant cow's milk at this time. Rulers of the earth are out on their expedition with a desire for victory. As the Sun has resorted to the direction (south) that serves the god of death, the north devoid of (the Sun) shines like a woman without the vermilion mark on the forehead. Presently with the Sun far away, the Himalayas abounding in snow has naturally justified its name. The days are enjoyable at noon as it is pleasant to move about during this time since the sun is not scorching. But the shade and water seem to be unfortunate (as they are not liked by any one. The days will be frostsmitten. The Sun will also be mild. Due to heavy dewfall the weather will be cold with the blowing of the wind. Forests will be empty (as no animals would be seen moving around.) At this time people do not sleep under the open sky. With the month of Pushya approaching, nights feel cool and look red due to frost. They prolong into three yamas. With the radiance of the Sun dimmed, with its orb reddened by frost, the moon does not shine clear like a mirror blurred with breath. On a fullmoon night the beams of the moon faded by forest look pale, dull like Sita scorched by the heat of the Sun. The west wind which by nature feels cold at this time blows doubly cold, hit by snow. The snowcold forest terrains are fertile with barley and wheat crops. As the Sun rises the swans and kraunchas produce pleasing notes. The tops of rice crops shining like gold resemble the flowers of datepalm.The fields full of ripe paddy bending a little (under the weight of grains) look delightful. The Sun risen at the distant horizon looks like the Moon, his lengthening rays covered with snow and dew. The heat of the Sun which we do not feel in the forenoon is comfortable during midday when the Sun shines slightly reddish white on earth. As the miadows are wet with dewdrops, the land looks delightful with mild Sunlight  shining on the surface. The wild tusker, extremely thirsty, touches the clean, cold water joyfully, but immediately withdraws its trunk unable to bear the cold. Just as inefficient warriors do not enter the warfield, aquatic birds sitting near water do not venture to take a plunge into it. The flowerless forest ranges appear as if they are asleep, enveloped in the darkness of frost and  snow . Now the rivers are not visible as the waters are covered with vapour. They are only inferred through the cackling of swans and the sands of the bank moistened with dewdrops. Due to snowfall, mildness of the Sun, and coldness (of weather) even the water flowing from the mountain top is not generally tasty. The lotuses in the tank  no more shine (bright) as they are decayed by age, their filaments and pericarps withered with only stalks remaining. At this time, righteous Bharata, the best among men, with his devotion to you must be sadly performing penance at his residence. Giving up his kingdom, honour and pleasures of many kinds, Bharata will be living like an ascetic, sleeping on the ground in cold weather, his food under restriction. At this time, Bharata,  accompanied by his subjects, must be daily going to river Sarayu for ablution. How can Bharata who was brought up in luxury, who is delicate, and deserves all comfort, take a dip in river Sarayu (in cold morning) ? He has a blue complexion, a pair of eyes like lotus petals, a thin waist and long arms. He is selfrestrained, softspoken, sweettempered and truthful. He knows his duty and maintains a low profile. A subduer  of enemies, he is heroic and great. Such Bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul.

A subduer  of enemies, he is heroic and great. Such Bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul. Although you dwell in the forest, your great brother Bharata has won the kingdom of heaven by faithfully adopting your asceticism. The saying that men follow mother's path but not the path of the father, has been disproved by Bharata. How could mother Kaikeyi, who has a husband like Dasaratha and a noble son like Bharata, be so wicked by nature ? When pious Lakshmana said thus to Rama out of his love for him, Rama replied, unable to tolerate the words of censure against mother (Kaikeyi) : O dear, Kaikeyi, our second mother, is never to be criticised like that. You may, however, speak more of Bharata, the lord of the Iksvakus. Even though I have made up my mind to dwell in the forest and keep my vow, my love for Bharata makes me waver like a child (Rama does not want Bharata to suffer on his account). I remember his dear, sweet, ambrosial  words, soothing to the heart and pleasing to the mind. O enhancer of joy of the Raghus  when shall I meet great Bharata, brave Satrughna and you all together? Expressing his grief in such manner, Rama reached Godavari where he took his bath with his brother and Sita. And then poised, they offered libations of water to their forefathers and gods and prayer to the rising Sun. Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana,Rama finished his bath in the river.He looked splendid like Lord Rudra followed by Nandi and the daughter of the king of  the mountains (Parvati).       Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Ablution over, Rama, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana, went back from the bank of the river Godabari to their hermitage. On reaching the hermitage, Rama and Lakshmana performed the forenoon rituals and entered the leafthatched cottage. Honoured by the ascetics , Rama  stayed there peacefully with brother Lakshmana, discussing diverse matters (from time to time). Longarmed Rama seated with Sita in the cottage, appeared like the Moon in conjunction with constellation Chitra. While Rama was thus seated, engrossed in conversation, there incidentally appeared a demoness. Surpanakha, sister of the tenheaded demon (Ravana) approached Rama shining like a god. The demoness was infatuated with Rama,  whose chest was like that of a lion, who was strongarmed, who had a glowing face, pleasing to the eyes, who walked with the gait of an elephant, whose hair was matted,  who was gentle and strong who was, endowed with royal traits, who had a blue lotuslike complexion, who was handsome as the god of love, and who resembled Indra.

Rama's face was lovely, Surpanakha's was hideous. Rama had a slender waist, she had a huge belly. His eyes were large,  hers were deformed. His hair was black and beautiful, hers was coppercoloured. He was lovely in appearance, she was ugly. His voice was sweet, hers was shrill. He was young, she was dreadfully old. He was positive, she was perverted. Rama was wellbehaved, she was wicked. Rama was just and loving while she was overcome by lust.  (This) demoness said to Rama : Rama's face was lovely, Surpanakha's was hideous. Rama had a slender waist, she had a huge belly. His eyes were large,  hers were deformed. His hair was black and beautiful, hers was coppercoloured. He was lovely in appearance, she was ugly. His voice was sweet, hers was shrill.

(This) demoness said to Rama : O Rama you are wearing matted hair like an ascetic, but living with your wife and holding bow and arrows. What brings you to this place haunted by demons ? You should tell me the truth ? Thus asked by the demoness Surpanakha,  Rama, scorcher of foes began telling her everything due to his simplemindedness. To Rama untruth is never acceptable at the hermitage and especially in the presence of a woman. (Rama replied) There was a king named Dasaratha who was mighty like the gods. I am his eldest son known among the people as Rama. Here is Lakshmana , my younger brother, who always follows me . And this  is the daughter of the king of Videha and my wife, wellknown as Sita. I have come here, commanded by the king, my father and mother.Intending to obey the orders of my father, and impelled by duty to  establish righteousness I have come  to reside here. I wish to know who you are. Tell me who your kins are. With lovely limbs you do not appear to be a demoness. Tell me truly what you have come here for. Having heard the words of Rama and overtaken by passion, the demoness said: My name is Surpanakha. I am a demoness who can assume any form at will, I move in this forest alone, unleashing a reign of terror. My name is Surpanakha. I am a demoness who can assume any form at will, I move in this forest alone, unleashing a reign of terror. My brother is Ravana, son of Visrava, and lord of all demons. You have heard his name I suppose. Kumbhakarna is another brother of mine. He is very strong. He is always in deep sleep. Vibhisna another brother. He is righteous free from  any demoniac trait. My other two brothers are Khara and Dusana who are wellknown heroes of war. Setting them aside, I came here, as soon as I saw you. You are the finest among men and I am here wishing you to be my husband. I have influence over others, I have capacity to move wherever I want. Be my husband forever. What will you do with Sita? She is ugly, deformed, unsuitable for you. I  am alone  fit for you. Look upon me as your wife. I will devour your brother along with this disfigured, unchaste and fearful lady with a flat belly. O darling, thereafter you can keep wandering with me in this Dandaka forest, enjoying the beauty of the mountain tops and forests. Thus addressed, Rama, skilled in speech, laughed and started speaking to that woman of bewitching eyes.       Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "To  Surpanakha bound by the noose of passion Rama with a smile replied in a clear, lucid manner: O lady I am married and here is my wife who is dear to me. To be a cowife to some one is indeed painful for people like you. Here is my younger brother Lakshmana. He is a man of good conduct, good look, valiant and virtuous. (Besides) he is not with his wife. He is not with his wife, and is in need of one. He is young, handsome and worthy. He will be an appropriate husband to you. O  woman of large eyes and fine hips, my brother is fit for you. You will (with him) shine like the radiant Sun on mount Meru. You will enjoy yourself without a cowife. You may approach him. Thus  told by Rama, the demoness, deluded with lust, left him suddenly, and said to Lakshmana: With my fine complexion, I will be a suitable wife for you. You can happily wander about in Dandaka forest with me. Thus addressed by the demoness Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, wellversed in the use of words gave her a befitting reply : O lotuscomplexioned woman , how can you act as a maid to a slave ? Why do you intend to be so? I am already dependent on my revered brother. O largeeyed one, you have a clear complexion. You may become the younger wife of my master who is lord of great wealth. And live a happy, fulfilled life. He will abandon this uglylooking, unchaste, frightening old woman of drooping belly and accept you alone as his wife. O lady of fair complexion and beautiful hips, which wise man will fall in love with any other female giving up a fine figure like you ? While Lakshmana was thus making fun of the dreadful, droopingbellied Surpanakha, she presumed his words to be true. Deluded with passion, Surpanakha said to formidable Rama, the scorcher of foes,  seated in the leafthatched hut along with Sita: You are holding on to this lady who is ugly, unchaste, fiercelooking, flatbellied and  aged and not caring for me. I shall eat up this woman now before your very eyes and I can move about happily with you without a cowife. While speaking this, Surpanakha, with eyes like flaming amber ran to the fawneyed Sita in great anger like a giant meteor hurtling towards the constellation of Rohini : Mighty Rama in a rage restrained her who was falling upon Sita like the noose of death, and said to Lakshmana: O handsome Lakshmana it is not proper to cut jokes with wicked, uncivilized persons. Now see Sita who has somehow survived. O tiger among men, this uncouth, bigbellied, unchaste and highly passionate demoness deserves to be formed. Thus instructed (by Rama), powerful Lakshmana took position by the side of Rama, angrily lifted the sword and cut off her nose and ears. Dreadful Surpanakha with her ears and nose cut off, roared in a hoarse voice and ran away into the forest in the same direction as she came. The dreadful demoness who thus was disfigured. Drenched in blood, she  thundered like a cloud in rainy season. Dripping blood profusely, the frightful demoness lifted her arms and entered the great forestroaring. A disfigured demoness, she fell down like the thunderbolt from the sky on the ground while her fiercelooking brother Khara sat surrounded by demons at Janasthana. Thereafter the sister of Khara, wild with fear and delusion and drenched in blood, narrated all about the arrival of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in the forest and her disfigurement.       Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Burning with anger to see his sister fallen down disfigured and drenched in blood, Khara enquired: Get up, give up your confusion and stupefaction. Tell me clearly by whom you have been disfigured like this ? Who will hurt  an innocent, venomous black serpent and stay away quietly close by for fun with his finger tip? Who is he who has tied has tied his throat with the noose of death out of ignorance and yet does not know the implications ? Who is he who has caused this injury to you, but does not understand that he has drunk deadly poison. You have sufficient strength and courage. You are capable of  moving as you like and taking any form at your will. By whom have you been brought to this state and drawn close to death? Which valiant person among gods, gandharvas, sages and other great people, has disfigured you like this ? I can see none in this world who can offend me, nor even the thousandeyed Indra among the gods. Just as the swan drinks only milk from water (mixed with milk), my arrows will (unerringly) drain the life from the enemy's body right now. Whose foamy, red blood will the earth drink while I strike his vital organs with my arrows in the fight ? Whose flesh will be eaten by cheerful flocks of (vultures), biting and tearing his body when he is killed by me in the battle ? Neither gods nor devils nor gandharvas nor even demons will have the power to rescue that hapless creature dragged by me ruthlessly in the battle. You should tell me as you slowly regain your consciousness which bragart has overpowered you in the forest with his strength. On hearing her angry brother, Surpanakha replied with words choked with tears: Here are two young sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, who are gentle, handsome,  strong, with eyes like white lotus, wearing deerskin and bark robes, living on fruits and roots, selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path. Here are two young sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, who are gentle, handsome,  strong, with eyes like white lotus, wearing deerskin and bark robes, living on fruits and roots, selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path. They are kings of the gandharvas with all royal insignia. I was not able to discern whether they are gods or humans. I saw between them a young, beautiful woman of slender waist, adorned with all kinds of jewels. I have been subjected to this state of an orphan unfaithful woman by both of them for the sake of that lady. I wish to drink the foamy blood of that crooked woman and of both the brothers slain on the battle front. O dear  this is my first wish and you must fulfil it. I will drink her blood and  of the two brothers, in the battle. As she was speaking, the inflamed Khara ordered fourteen very strong demons, comparable to Yama, the god of death, to proceed. Two human beings equipped with weapons, clad in bark robes and deerskin have entered the dreadful Dandaka forest along with a woman of bewitching beauty. I want you to get  both of them along with that notorious woman killed. This sister of mine will drink their blood. O demons quickly go and crush them with your power and fulfil my sister's sincere wish. Thus commanded, the fourteen demons along with Surpanakha rushed there like windblown clouds. The nightrangers were unable to crush him(Rama) despite their sharp, glowing weapons  just as wild elephants cannot face all at once the rising flame of the forest fire.       Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The frightful Surpanakha came to the hermitage of Rama and showed both the brothers and Sita to the demons. They saw mighty Rama together with Vaidehi and Lakshmana sitting in the leafthatched cottage. Seeing the demons along with Surpanakha arrive, said the handsome Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty to his brother Lakshmana, who was blazing like fire : O Lakshmana  stand by Sita for a while. I shall kill these demons who have come here. Lakshmana heard him and in turn honoured the word of Rama, knower of the self. Righteous Rama too, lifted up his great bow decked with gold and fastened the string and then said to the demons: We, Rama and Lakshmana, sons of Dasaratha, are brothers, who have entered the inaccessible Dandaka forest along with Sita. Feeding on fruits and roots and following the righteous path, we are living in Dandaka forest like ascetics. Why are you torturing us? I came here equipped with bows, arrows and weapons, asked by ascetics to kill in the battle sinners like you who are offending them. If you care for your life, you may return, or else, if you please you may remain (die) here, O demons. At these words, the destroyers of brahmins, the fourteen demons were inflamed. They lifted their spears and spoke: You have incited the wrath of Khara, our great master for which you will now pay with your life in the fight. How can you face us alone? We outnumber you? Leave alone fighting, you cannot even stand in front of us. Come on with daggers and sharpedged spears hurled, you will give up your life,your prowess as well as the bow held in your hand. Saying these words, the fourteen infuriated demons hurled their spears at invincible Rama. All the fourteen spears hurled turned into splinters by the same number of golden arrows released by Rama. Then the effulgent Rama, mighty angry, took fourteen arrows sharpened by stones and glowing like the  Sun. Rama took the bow, stretched it and aimed at his target, the demons  and sent the arrows as Indra would release the thunderbolt. Goldfeathered blazing arrows decorated with gold, released by Rama flew fast and pierced the chests of the demons. Drenched in blood they (the arrows) thundered (out of their chests) and  plunged into the earth. With their hearts split, their bodies drenched in blood, disfigured and lifeless, the demons fell down on earth like trees cut  at the roots. Seeing the demons fallen on the ground, the demoness wild with anger and fear roared. Her blood slightly dried up, she came back afflicted to Khara and fell down like a sallaki tree, its sap oozing. Missing Then desperately screaming and shedding tears with a sad face beside her brother, she roared again and again. When Surpanakha saw the demons fall dead on the battleground, she ran to Khara,her brother and told in detail about the death of the demons.       Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing Surpanakha collapse, Khara said in clear terms about the unfortunate situation she had created: The valiant demons who feed on blood have been commissioned for your pleasure. Why are you crying again? They are loyal and faithful to me. They are always my wellwishers. Even when attacked, they cannot be killed. They never fail to carry out my orders. I wish to know what makes you lament and roll on the ground like a serpent and hissing? When I am here like a lord to protect you, why do you weep like an orphan? Get up. Give up your anxiety. Be not afraid. Thus consoled by Khara, invincible Surpanakha wiped her tearful eyes and said to her brother: My ears and nose sliced off, drenched with blood, I came to you and you pacified me. O warrior  you had sent, out of anger, fourteen demons to put an end to Rama along with Lakshmana in order to please me. The demons who went with spears in their hands were killed, their hearts pierced by  Rama's arrows. Seeing the powerful demons collapse on the ground in a moment's time through Rama's action, I was frightened. O demon  I am scared and sad. To me everything looks frightening. I, therefore, seek refuge in you. I am drowned in a vast sea of sorrow where crocodiles in the form of distress reside. It is full of rows of waves of fright. Why do you not save me? The demons who live on flesh, who came following me fell down on earth and lay dead,  shot by the sharp arrows of Rama. O demon  if you have compassion for me or for the demons, if you have the power and energy to face Rama, kill the enemy of the demons living in Dandaka forest. If now you do not kill that Rama, my enemy, O shameless one, I will give up my life in your very presence. Instinctively I can foresee that you and your army do not have the capability to encounter that great Rama in a fight. You call yourself a hero, yet are not able to kill two humans like Rama and Lakshmana. Your claim to heroism is false. You are not a hero at all. O demon  you are a disgrace to the family. If you have power or energy, kill that Rama dwelling in Dandaka forest. You have little strength and less heroism. You with your relations should immediately leave Janasthana. What kind of position do you have here? Let down by the brilliance of Rama, son of Dasaratha, you will be soon destroyed. He is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant. Let down by the brilliance of Rama, son of Dasaratha, you will be soon destroyed. He is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant. Overcome by sorrow, the bigbellied demoness cried  in several ways and being very sad started beating her chest with both hands.       Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Ashamed and accused thus in the presence of the demons, the valiant Khara spoke to Surpanakha in harsh words: Like the overslowing salt sea water, I am unable to contain this my excessive anger arising out of your insult. Rama is a shortlived human. I do not care for his valour. His life span will be shortened (he will be killed) now for his own misdeeds. Restrain your tears and your anxieties I will send Rama along with his brother to the abode of Yama. With his life ebbing out, killed by my axe in the fight, you will drink today, O demoness, Rama's red, hot blood. On hearing the words that came out of Khara's mouth, she was pleased. And in stupidity began praising her brother once again as the best of demons. Khara, accused by her earlier and admired again, said to Dusana, chief of army: There are fourteen thousand demons at my command ready to act according to my will. They are warriors of terrific speed and will not retreat from the fight. They are of the colour of the dark blue cloud, dreadful and merciless, strong and powerful fighters who roam about forturing people. O handsome one, get them all, powerful like tigers, demons with large countenances, mighty and arragant, ready (for the fight). O goodnatured one, get my chariot, bows and arrows, wonderful swords of different kinds and sharp missiles ready quickly. O expert in warfare, I wish to lead those great warriors of Paulasthya family, to kill that immodest Rama. While Khara was speaking thus, Dusana reported that a huge chariot of the colour of the Sun yoked with good horses of variegated hues stood ready. Then the impatient Khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount Meru. It was decorated with pure gold, had golden wheels, poles studded with vaidurya. The carriage of the chariot was engraved with golden figures of fishes, flowers, trees, the Sun, stars, flocks of auspicious birds, flags and swords. Shining with small bells, it was yoked to fine horses. Then the impatient Khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount Meru. It was decorated with pure gold, had golden wheels, poles studded with vaidurya.

Khara mounted the chariot, saw the demons holding great weapons, wearing dreadful shields and holding flags, and ordered them to march. Then the army of the demons wearing dreadful shields, holding weapons and flags, and making a loud noise started in great speed from Janasthanam. The fourteen thousand demons loyal to the wishes of Khara, took in their hands, maces, piercing weapons, spears, sharp axes used in battle, swords, wheels, splinters, iron clubs, powerful missiles, dreadful iron bars of giant size, bows made of bamboo, clubs and frightening weapons like thunderbolt (of Indra) and  departed from Janasthana.

Khara's chariot moved a bit behind the army of demons of frightening prowess who rushed forward to attack (Rama). Knowing the mind of Khara, the charioteer hastened the horses of the colourful  chariot decorated with pure gold. Spurred by the charioteer, the chariot of Khara, the slayer of enemies, produced a rattle that filled all four quarters and the intermediate directions. Khara in extreme anger hastened, like Yama, to slay his enemy. He roared loudly like a cloud raining hail stones and impelled his charioteer to speed up.       Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As the army marched from there (Janasthana) a huge dark cloud of the colour of an ass rained dreadful inauspicious water, red as blood. The swift horses yoked to the chariot stumbled casually while galloping on the plane highway sprinkled with flowers. A dark ring, bloodred in colour appeared on the border of the Sun's orb, dark in the middle. This phenomenon of the Sun appeared like a ring of moving charcoal covering the Sun. A huge vulture, frightening to look at flew up and sat on top of the flag on the staff of gold. Flesheating beasts and birds flocked at Janasthana producing a cacophony. The dreadful jackals making ghastly howls turning towards the illuminated direction and produced frightening sounds indicating inauspicious time for the demons. The clouds looked like shattered mountains pouring down bloodlike rain which filled the sky and made it appear frighteningly different. A terrific darkness, spread all over, produced frightening horripilation. Even the four quarters and the intermediary zones were not discernible. Even before Sunset the twilight looked like a fresh wound. Then wild animals, birds, kankas, jackals and vultures facing towards Khara screeched, indicating danger. Bad omens that always bring inauspiciousness were a dreadful evidence of what is going to happen. Jackals howled, facing Khara's army with their mouths emitting fire. The planet Ketu appeared  like an iron beam near the Sun. Although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day, Rahu eclipsed the Sun. Wind blew hard and the Sun was lustreless. The planet Ketu appeared  like an iron beam near the Sun. Although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day, Rahu eclipsed the Sun. Wind blew hard and the Sun was lustreless. The stars rose in the sky and glittered like fireflies even before night arrived. The fishes and the aquatic birds in the lotusponds hid themselves under water.  Lotuses dried up in tanks and the trees stood bereft of flowers and fruits. Although there was no wind, dust rose like a brown cloud and the sarika birds sang (vichi kuchi) thoughtlessly. Dreadful to watch were the thunderstorms and the meteors that dropped down from the sky. The earth trembled all over with mountains, groves and forests. While the intelligent and courageous Khara was seated on the chariot and shouting, his left shoulder shook violently and throat throttled. While watching all this, his eyes brimmed with tears. His forehead ached. Yet he was too deluded to beat a retreat. Looking at these dreadful, horripilating occurrences Khara laughed and said to the demons: Valiant and strong, I do not take seriously these terrifying omens boding calamity  just as a strong man does not care for the weak. With my sharp arrows I can even bring down the stars from the sky. If angered, I can cause mortality to the god of death. I do not wish to return, without killing with my sharp arrows that Rama who is proud of his strength and his brother Lakshmana. Let my sister be satisfied by drinking the blood of both Rama and Lakshmana on whose account this adversity has come. I have never faced defeat in wars, and all of you have seen it with your eyes. I am not telling you a lie. When angry, I can kill even (Indra) the wielder of the thunderbolt, rider of the intoxicated Airavata and lord of the gods. What to speak of these two petty humans? Fallen into the deathtrap, the great army of the demon, felt very happy on hearing Khara roaring. Great souls like sages, gods, gandharvas, and siddhas including celestial bards assembled to see the battle. Holy men assembled and uttered benedictions, saying, 'let there be wellbeing for the cows and brahmins associated with men of pious deeds in all the (three) worlds. 'Let Rama conquer the descendants of Paulasthya in the war like Visnu, the wielder of the wheel had defeated great demons'. The great ascetics were talking thus and more. The gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened (who were doomed to death). The great ascetics were talking thus and more. The gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened (who were doomed to death). Seeing Khara, their chief on the chariot driving fast, the army of demons too marched forward.

                "When Khara endowed with malicious might was marching towards the hermitage, Rama and his brother saw the same omens of impending calamity the demon had seen. When Rama saw the most dreadful, horripilating phenomena foreboding calamity, he said to Lakshmana: O longarmed Lakshmana see these calamitous phenomena that forebode mass destruction of men and demons. These rumbling clouds, brownishred like the colour of a donkey,  are moving about in the sky showering streams of blood. O Lakshmana all my arrows are smoking and this goldplated bow welcomes me to war. The way the forestbirds are screeching makes me foresee danger and makes survival doubtful. A mass destruction of life is going to take place. There is no doubt about it. O brave Lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again, indicating the defeat of the enemy. Your beaming visage presages victory. A mass destruction of life is going to take place. There is no doubt about it. O brave Lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again, indicating the defeat of the enemy. Your beaming visage presages victory. O Lakshmana, while preparing for war, those whose faces look pale are, for sure, going to die. A dreadful roar of demons and the loud sound of wardrums beaten by the wicked demons are heard. A wise man who apprehends danger or one who desires his own good should plan his defence even before the onset of danger. Therefore, take shelter along with Sita in the inaccessible mountain cave, overgrown with trees, ready with your bow and arrows. O dear, I do not like you to oppose this word of honour. You must touch my feet and go without delay. You are valiant and strong. There is no doubt that you can kill all these demons. But I desire to kill them. Thus ordered by Rama, Lakshmana took the arrows and the bow and accompanied by Sita took shelter in the inaccessible cave. With Lakshmana and Sita inside the cave, Rama heaved his shield, saying, Oh the work is accomplished. Adorned with the shield, Rama shone like smokeless fire rising in darkness. Valiant Rama lifted the huge bow and arrows and stood there, filling the directions with the twangs of his bow. Then the gods along with gandharvas, siddhas, and celestial bards assembled there, wishing to witness the war. Great ascetics of the world, distinguished brahmarsis, accomplishers of pious deeds assembled and said to one another: 'Let there be wellbeing for the cows, brahmins, and all the worlds. Let Rama, the scion of the Raghu race, conquer the Paulastyas (demons) in war like lord Visnu, wielder of the disc, who defeated the most powerful demons'. Thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous Rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons, performers of terrific deeds, on the other. Thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous Rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons, performers of terrific deeds, on the other. Rajarsis, siddhas, great brahmins with their clan and gods on the celestial chariots waited to see the war whetted with curiosity. Seeing Rama standing on the war front, engrossed and radiating heroic lustre, all beings were alarmed. Rama, who is unwearied in action and who is of an incomparable (lovely) form, looked ferocious like the wielder of Pinaka (Lord Siva). Then appeared on all sides the wellequipped army of demons raising deep sounds with dreadful shields, weapons and banners. The forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions,  shouting at one another, stretching the bowstrings constantly, yawning, proclaiming loudly and beating the drums. The forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions,  shouting at one another, stretching the bowstrings constantly, yawning, proclaiming loudly and beating the drums. The ferocious animals of the forest got frightened and ran away to silent spots without looking back. The fierce army, deep like the sea, equipped with various missiles approached Rama. Rama, wellversed in warfare, cast his eyes on all sides to see the army of Khara that had come prepared for war. Rama stretched the formidable bow and lifted the arrows from his quiver to kill the demons and assumed intense anger. Rama stood burning in anger like the fire of the doom's day. It was difficult even to look at him. Seeing him full of glow even the sylvan deities ran away. Rama in anger looked like Lord Siva ready to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha. Seeing Rama flashing (in anger) and standing on the warfront all creatures ran away frightened. The army of demons equipped with blazing armour, bows and banners appeared like a mass of blue clouds at Sunrise.       Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Khara accompanied by his pilot party arrived at the hermitage of Rama, the destroyer of enemies and saw him in fury, standing ready with his bow. On seeing Rama, Khara held his terribly twanging bow and arrow, stood facing him, and ordered the charioteer to drive towards him. Commanded by Khara, the charioteer also urged the horses towards the mightyarmed Rama standing alone and wielding the bow. Seeing Khara attacking (Rama) all the demon ministers surrounded him  roaring. Seated on a chariot in the midst of the demons, Khara looked like the rising Mars in the middle of the stars. Khara struck Rama of immeasurable prowess with a thousand arrows and roared loudly. Thereafter all the infuriated demons showered on invincible Rama, wielder of a fierce bow, many kinds of weapons. Overtaken by anger, the demons continuously hurled at Rama hammers, spears, spikes, barbed missiles, swords and battleaxes. Very powerful demons like huge clouds roared, eager to kill Rama in war. They ran forward on chariots, horses and tall elephants, looking like  mountain tops. The battalions of demons sent down streams of arrows on Rama just like clouds  downpour on mountains. Surrounded by the terrible demons Rama appeared like Lord Siva at dusk with hosts of his retinues arounds. Rama resisted the weapons released by the demons like the sea, the inflow of river waters. Rama remained unhurt like a great mountain struck by many glowing thunderbolts. He felt no pain even though his limbs were hit by the dreadful weapons. Wounded all over the body, bleeding through the wounds caused by weapons, Rama looked like the evening Sun covered with clouds. Seeing Rama left alone surrounded by many thousands of demons, the gods, ghandarvas and siddhas became very sad. Thereafter Rama, mighty angry, bent his bow and released hundreds and thousands of unfeathered arrows. As if sporting, Rama discharged the arrows attached with herons' feathers. The arrows were inescapable, unbearable like that of Yama's staff, that went straight without missing the target. The arrows like the noose of the god of death released by Rama on the enemy army easily destroyed the lives of the demons. Rama's arrows pierced the bodies of the demons and drenched in blood, they, looking like burning fire, shone in the sky. From Rama's bow bent into a cirle, countless fierce arrows able to take the lives of demons were released. In war Rama cut asunder the bows, flag tops, armour and heads of demons, their shoulders and thighs that were like the trunks of elephants, in their hundreds and thousands. He killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers, elephants along with riders, the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death. He killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers, elephants along with riders, the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death. The bodies of the demons torn into pieces by the very sharp iron arrows and by the arrows called vikarni, they cried and shouted aloud in pitiable voices. Just like the dried up forest burnt by the fire, the army was totally destroyed by Rama's arrows that pierced into the vital parts of the soldiers. A few warriors of fierce strength approached Rama and hurled at him very powerful weapons, spears, swords and axes. Strongarmed Rama attacked them with his arrows and cut off their heads and took their lives. The heads, armour and bows fell down broken on the ground like trees in the wind gererated by Garuda's wings. The rest of the demons hit by the arrows ran desperate towards Khara for refuge. Pacifying them all, Dusana regathered them again and ran towards Rama like an angry Yama rushing towards Rudra. Under Dusana's protection, all of them felt relieved from fear and, carrying sal and palm trees and stones as weapons, advanced towards Rama again. Holding spears, hammers and bows in their hands, the mighty demons rained on Rama weapons like arrows, trees and stones. The thrilling, fierce, horrifying and horripilating battle again ensued betwen Rama and the demons. As the infuriated demons again hurtled towards Rama, filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles, Rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras, producing a frightening warcry.

As the infuriated demons again hurtled towards Rama, filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles, Rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras, producing a frightening warcry. Rama then let out from his bow, stretched round, thousands of arrows that covered all the ten quarters. The demons, though wounded, could not see whereform the terrible arrows came. They only saw Rama shooting the arrows. Through the darkness created by the arrows that covered the sky and the Sun, Rama looked as though he was vomitting them. It seemed as if it all happened at the same time, the entire earth filling with demons seriously injured, slain and fallen down on the ground. There were bodies of demons pierced and torn, thinned and fallen down, destroyed, broken and cut into pieces scattered in their thousands. Slain thus by Rama's arrows, the ground was littered with (bodies of) demons with limbs dismembered, headdresses and shoulders cut off, arms, thighs and knees decked with various ornaments amputated, chariots, horses, best of elephants, fans made of the tail of chamari deer (used as an insignia of royalty), umbrellas, several  flags, and weapons like spears, swords, darts, battleaxes and stones crushed into pieces and arrows splintered and scattered all over. The ground looked frightening.       Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Mightyarmed Dusana saw  the army  getting killed in war. He led the forces of five thousand demons, dreadfuly quick at fighting, dangeous to face and who will not beat a retreat. The demons continuously hurled at him (Rama)  spears and swords and rained stones, trees and arrows from all sides Righteous Rama, retaliated with his sharp arrows such as the rain of trees and stones, the mighty destroyers of life. Rama retaliated in great anger to kill without caring for the shower of weapons like a bull with its eyes closed. Overpowered by anger, Rama, with a blazing glow, covered Dusana and his army with his arrows. Thereafter Dusana, chief of the army, angrily released at Rama equally powerful arrows comparable to thunderbolt. Heroic Rama, mighty angry, then, broke the big bow of  Dusana, with his swordlike arrow. And with a series of four arrows cut his four horses to pieces. After killing the horses with sharp arrows Rama severed the charioteer's head with an arrow of the shape of the crescent moon and pierced Dusana's chest with a set of three arrows. With his bow and chariot broken, charioteer and horses killed,  Dusana took up a spear in his hand that appeared like a huge mountain top. Bound by golden bands, covered the iron nails, wetted with the enemy's marrow it created a horripilation. It appeared as though it  could crush the army of gods and render the enemy powerless. It carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemy's fort.

It carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemy's fort. With the spear that looked like a mighty serpent, Dusana, the cruel demon, advanced towards Rama. Seeing Dusana going to pounce upon him, Rama cut off with two arrows both his arms adorned with armlets. With the hands amputated, his huge spear, like the banner of Indra, slipped off his hands and fell down on the ground on the battle front. Dusana fell down on the ground with broken hands like a proud elephant with both his tusks shattered. Seeing Dusaana collapse dead on the ground, all beings hailed Rama, saying, 'Well done, well done'. Meanwhile all the three army chiefs, Mahakapala, Sthulaksha, and the mighty Pramathi ran towards Rama in anger, bound (as though) by the noose of death. Mahakapala had a huge spear, Sthulaksha, a sharpedged spear and Pramathi, a battleaxe. On seeing them rushing to attack him with sharp weapons, Rama received them quickly with pointed arrows as though they were guests. Mahakapala's head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and Pramathi was killed with a countless series  of arrows. Pramathi's body, like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground. Mahakapala's head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and Pramathi was killed with a countless series  of arrows. Pramathi's body, like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground. Rama filled the eyes of Sthulaksha with sharp arrows, and in anger shot five thousand arrows at the five thousand followers of Dusana in a moment and sent them to the abode of Yama. Seeing Dusana and his followers killed, enraged Khara commanded his extremely strong army chiefs this way: Dusana and his followers are killed in the battle. You, all the demons, along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being, Rama. Dusana and his followers are killed in the battle. You, all the demons, along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being, Rama. Having spoken thus, angry Khara ran towards Rama. Syenagami, Pruthugriva, Yajnasatru, Vihanga, Durjaya, Karaveeraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghamali, Mahamali, Sarpasya, Rudhirasanaall these twelve valiant army chiefs along with their forces rushed towards Rama, releasing the sharpest arrows at him.

Powerful Rama thereafter slayed the remaining army with his weapons studded with gold and diamonds and glowing like fire. The goldtipped arrows which resembled fire covered with smoke shattered the army of demons like huge trees knocked down by thunder. Rama killed a hundred demons  with one hundred arrows by a single stroke. The same way he killed a thousand of them with a thousand arrows on the battle front. The demons fell down on the ground with their shields  and ornaments broken, their  bows stained with blood splintered. The entire ground was littered with bodies of demons fallen in the battle with loose hair and with drops of blood on them looking like a great sacrificial altar strewn all over with kusa grass. With the slaughtered bodies of demons lying on the ground, the forest in a moment looked very dreadful like hell with the mud of soil soaked with flesh and blood. Fourteen thousand formidable demons were killed by Rama, a pedestrian human,  singlehanded. Of that entire army great warrior Khara,Trisira and Rama, destroyer of foes alone remained. The rest of the mighty, dreadful, intolerable demons were killed on the war front by Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana. Thereafter seeing the formidable army killed by mighty Rama, Khara lifted a thunderbolt like Indra, and advanced towards Rama in a great chariot.       Thus ends the twentysixth sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As Khara advanced towards Rama, Trisira the chief of the army approached him and said these words: O valiant one assign this work to me. Refrain from this audacity. See how I am going to put down the mightyarmed Rama in the battle. I promise you on my weapon that I will kill Rama.He who killed all demons deserves to be slain. Restrain yourself for a moment from the enthusiasm to fight the war. Please act as an arbitrator and see who is killing whom. If Rama is killed be happy and go to Janasthana or else if I am killed you can fight. When Khara was prevailed upon by Trisara in that manner with a wish to face death, Khara  permitted him  by saying 'You may go and fight'.Accordingly he advanced towards Rama. Trisira who looked a mountain with three peaks also got horses harnessed to a shining chariot and to attack Rama proceeded. Trisira unleashed a stream of arrows like a huge cloud (releasing rain). They produced sound, a drum drenched with water, creates. On seeing demon Trisira advancing towards him, Rama shook sharp arrows off his bow. The tumultuous combat between Rama and Trisira looked like the strong fight between a lion and an elephant. Then Rama hit  with three arrows on the forehead by Trisira flew into a fury and said in a state of great excitement: Oh see the strength of this undaunted demon whose arrows fell like flowers on my forehead and only left a scratch. Receive the arrows released from my bowstring. Saying so, the angry and agitated Rama discharged fourteen arrows, venomous like a snake, on the chest of Trisira . With four arrows having strong joints, the mighty hero (Rama) threw down his enemy's four swiftfooted horses. Rama brought down the charioteer with eight arrows and with one tore down the lofty banner of the chariot to shreds. Rama then hit the demon with arrows on his chest while he was running away from the broken chariot. The demon became numb. The mighty Rama in fury dismembered the heads of that demon with three sharp and swift arrows. The demon with his heads decapitated, hit by Rama's arrows a little while ago, fell down, vomitting blood. Those surviving demons who were under the protection of Khara got scared and retreated fast and fled like deer frightened by a tiger. Personally persuading the fleeing army to come back, the angry Khara leaped forward towards Rama just as Rahu approaches the moon.       Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Khara was overtaken by fear at the prowess of Rama, when he saw Dusana and Trisira killed. Khara, the mighty demon, saw his large, irrepressible army killed. He saw Trisira and Dusana slain singlehanded by Rama. Nervous, he advanced towards Rama wage war just as Namuchi approached Indra. Khara, the mighty demon, saw his large, irrepressible army killed. He saw Trisira and Dusana slain singlehanded by Rama. Nervous, he advanced towards Rama wage war just as Namuchi approached Indra. Khara drew his strong bowstring in anger and released the bloodhungry arrows, which appeared like venomous snakes. Khara, sat on the chariot, and with a twang of his bowstring released arrows in all directions, exhibiting his skill in the use of weapons. When Rama, the great warrior, saw Khara approaching him, he fixed powerful arrows  on his bow and covered all directions and intermediate quarters with his arrows. He rained sparkling arrows which were irresistible. He filled the sky with arrows just as the raingod fills it with rain without leaving any space. The arrows released by Khara and Rama on one another filled the entire sky. Everywhere only arrows and no sky could be seen. While they were engaged in the battle, eager to kill each other the sky was covered with arrow and the Sun could not be seen. Then Khara shot Rama with Nalika darts and darts called Vikarni like goads hit a mighty elephant. Demon Khara positioned on the chariot, bow in hand, appeared to all beings like Yama, god of death holding the noose. Khara thought valiant Rama who had destroyed his whole army might be exhausted by now. When Rama saw Khara aggressively advancing like a lion to attack him, he was not perturbed, for he knew he was a fawn before a lion (which Rama was). Then Khara mounting a great chariot which was glowing like the Sun, advanced towards Rama just as an insect hurtles towards fire. Exhibiting his agility of the hand, Khara shattered the bow and the arrow in the grip of Rama ,the  great soul. The influriated Khara this time took up seven arrows blazing like Indra's thunderbolt  and hit his armour. The armour of Rama who looked radiant like the Sun fell on the ground, struck by the welljointed darts released by Khara. Khara then attacked Rama of unequal strength in fight, with a thousand darts  and roared loudly. Rama, scion of the Raghu race, afflicted by the darts in all parts of the body, glowed in his anger like smokeless fire burning. Then Rama, destroyer of foes, strung another great bow of fearful sound in order to put an end to the enemy. Thereafter Rama advanced, aiming at Khara the superior Vaishnava bow given by sage Agastya. Rama took up in a rage the welljointed, smooth darts with golden feathers and broke the flag post of the chariot of Khara to pieces. The beautiful, golden flag post, broken into several pieces, fell down on earth.It appeared as if the Sun had come down to earth at the behest of the gods. Quite enraged, Khara who knew how to hit the tender parts (of the body) in an encounter sent out four arrows on Rama. It was like poking an elephant's limbs with a javelin. Rama, hit by the arrows released from the bow of Khara, all his limbs drenched in blood, became very furious. The best among archers and a supreme shooter, he lifted the bow, fixed his target and released six arrows in the great fight. Rama hit one arrow on the head, two on the shoulders and three of the shape of the crescent moon on the chest (of the enemy). Enraged and effulgent Rama took up thirteen darts, radiant like the Sun, with a wish to kill the demon. Rama, like Indra, strong and mighty, broke the yoke of Khara's chariot with one arrow, the four horses with four arrows, and with the sixth the charioteer's head, with three others the main pole of the chariot, with two the axle of the chariot, and with the twelfth Khara's bow and arrows were splintered.

Then, with bow broken, chariot destroyed, horses and charioteer dead, Khara jumped  down the chariot and stood on the ground holding a mace. Then the gods, along with great sages came down in aerial chariots and assembled there. Delighted, they adored Rama, the great warrior, with folded hands for the work done.       Thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Effulgent Rama looked at Khara who stood with a mace in hand minus his chariot  and said to him first in a gentle voice and then harshly : Although you command a huge army with many elephants, horses, chariots, etc.  you have done such cruel deeds that the entire world despises you. One who  is wicked, does sinful deeds and causes distress to all beings, will not survive even if he is the lord of the three worlds. O nightranger, one who does a horrific deed which is against the world will be killed like an evil serpent come near. Whoever commits sinful deeds out of greed or passion and without realisation will be ruined at the end like a lizard that eats hailstone (and dies). O demon  what benefit will you  get by killing the venerable ascetics, followers of righteous path residing in Dandaka forest? Cruel people, who are despised by the world for their sinful deeds, will not  be prosperous for long just like trees with decayed roots. Just as the trees bear flowers at the proper season, so also people will certainly reap the fruits of their terrible, sinful deeds at appropriate time. O nightranger  people will reap the result of their sinful actions in this world soon like one eating poisonous food. O nightranger  I have come with the orders of the king to put an end to the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful, sinful and offensive deeds in this world. Now when I unleash the golden  arrows, they will pierce through your body and come out like serpents emerging from the anthill. Slain by me in the battle today, you and your army will follow the righteous men eaten by you in Dandaka forest. The great seers whom you have earlier tortured and killed will, from their aerial vehicles, see you fallen into hell. O vile fellow, now you may strike at me as you please. I will make your head fall  down like a palm fruit. Challenged by Rama  in that manner, Khara, his senses switched off, eyes turned red due to anger, replied laughing : O son of Dasaratha, it is not praiseworthy to kill ordinary demons in war. Why do you praise yourself for it? The valiant, strong and the best of men do not at all speak proudly of themselves  and their valour. O Rama common people, having no control over themselves and the lowest of kshatriyas boast of themselves in the world in a meaningless way as you are doing (now). When death comes in a battle no hero will name his race and boast of himself unnessarily. All your meanness is exhibited by your boasting just as the kusa grass caught by fire appears like gold. Indeed, (it is strange that) you do not see me holding a mace and standing here like an unshakeable mountain which contains minerals and supports the earth. Just like lord Yama, holding a noose of death is alone enough to destroy the three worlds, I am alone sufficient to take away your life in war, a mace in hand. Indeed, I shall not speak any more even though a lot can be said on you. But the Sun is about to set and it will be improper to wage war thereafter. You have killed these fourteen thousand demons. Therefore, I will wipe their tears by destroying you. Having said this, highly enraged Khara adorned with large shoulder bands, hurled  at Rama, his mace glowing like a thunderbolt. The huge, blazing mace hurled by Khara's arms reduced the trees and shrubs into ashes and came close to Rama. The mace, which moved in the sky burning like the noose of death was shattered to pieces by Rama. The mace shattered by the arrows of Rama , fell down scattered to pieces on the ground like a female serpent subdued by the force of mantras and medicine.       Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, fond of dharma, broke into pieces Khara's mace with his arrows, and smiling at bewildered Khara, said: O lowly demon, you have already exhibited all your strength. Inferior to me in energy, you are needlessly roaring. The mace about which you boasted so much has betrayed your confidence. Shattered by my arrows it now lies on the ground. You said you will wipe the tears of the dead demons. (Now) those words have proved false. You are mean. You have false pride. You are of low behaviour. I shall take away your life, O demon,, Just as Garuda carried off the nectar. Now with your throat split open by my arrows , the earth will drink your foamy blood full of bubbles. With all your limbs covered with dust, both the arms dropped down and stretched  out  on the ground, you will sleep as though hugging the earth, like embracing a rare woman. When you, O vile demon, will go into eternal sleep the Dandaka grounds will provide shelter to those who deserve it here. O demon, when my arrows destroy your hold over Janasthana the sages will move freely without fear all over this forest. Having lost all their relations, the demonesses, who were causing fear to others,will move away with faces full of tears. Your wives, who have got a husband like you, must have been born to a befitting race. They will taste the pangs of sorrow today, for no reasons whatsoever. O cruel, mean, vile fellow, you had been always opposing the brahmins who pour oblations in fire under fear. When Rama was thus speaking in a state of excitement in the middle of war, the choleric Khara  started abusing him in a harsher tone. You are very haughty. When there is every cause of fear you pretend fearlessness. Being in the grip of death you do not know what to speak and what not to speak. Those bound by the noose of death, do not know what to and what not to do, as their six senses cease to function. Having said thus to Rama with a frown on his face, Khara, looking around for something to strike him with, saw a huge sal tree not very far. Khara, biting his lower lip, uprooted the tree , lifted it with his mighty arms, and shouting at Rama loudly hurled it at him, saying, 'You are dead'. Khara, biting his lower lip, uprooted the tree , lifted it with his mighty arms, and shouting at Rama loudly hurled it at him, saying, 'You are dead'. Brave Rama shattered with a flood of arrows the tree falling over him and summoned sharp anger to end Khara in war. Full of sweat and with the corners of his eyes turned red, Rama hit Khara with a thousand arrows in the encounter. With his body pierced with arrows his blood started flowing like the waterfalls flow from mount Prasravana. Completely struck by Rama's arrows, Khara, intoxicated with the smell of  blood, ran speedily charging towards Rama. Rama who was an adept in the science of arms picked up his valour quickly and moved a step back (not  to give him an opportunity to strike), looking at the highly agitated Khara falling upon him, with his body fully drenched in blood. Rama took a dart glowing like fire which resembled another Brahmadanda to kill Khara in the war. Righteous Rama placed on his bow the dart given him by wise Indra, king of the gods, and shot it at Khara. Bending the bow fully, Rama released the arrow roaring like a violent gust of wind, which fell on Khara's chest. Just as Yama was burnt by Rudra's fire(from his eyes) in Swetaranya, Khara collapsed on the ground consumed by the fire of Rama's arrow. Khara fell down just like Vrutra or Bala killed by Indra's thunderbolt or like Numuchi by the froth of the sea. Then the rajarsis, great seers gathered together, offered their worship to Rama  and said these words joyfully : For this purpose, killer of Paka, the gIorious Indra (who can break a fortress), came to the hermitage of Sarabhanga. You are brought to this place by the great sages who had cleverly devised a plan to kill the cruel sinners, these demons O son of Dasaratha, you have accomplished such a task that hereafter the sages in Dandaka will discharge their rightful duties happily. Meanwhile the wonderstruck gods along with the charanas (celestial bards) got together and began beating the drums and raining showers of flowers on Rama from all sides. 'In a little more than half a moment of this great war Rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons, led by Khara and Dusana. 'In a little more than half a moment of this great war Rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons, led by Khara and Dusana. 'Rama who knows the self has performed a great work. Oh what prowess what efficiency  only lord Visnu could do this'. So saying all the gods went back to their respective destinations. In the mean time, heroic Lakshmana accompanied by Sita came out of the mountain cave happily and entered the hermitage. Then victorious Rama having been worshipped by the seers and also by Lakshmana entered the hermitage. On seeing Rama killing the enemies of the great sages for their happiness Sita felt glad and embraced her husband. Sita, daughter of Janaka, was happy to see the demons killed by Rama who himself was unhurt. Then the daughter of Janaka, cheerful Sita, who had a face bright like the moon, embraced Rama, destroyer of demons who was worshipped by the delighted sages.       Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Quickly did Akampana leave Janasthana, and quickly he entered Lanka. He said to Ravana: O king many demons dwelling at Janasthana including Khara have been killed. I manged to escape with much difficulty. When Akampana thus reported to the tenheaded Ravana, his eyes reddened with anger. He spoke to Akampana as if he was burning him with his eyes : He who has destroyed my beautiful Janasthana is sure to die. His life is under the control of others (his enemies). Where can he be(alive) in all the worlds? One who has caused displeasure to me cannot be happy, be it Indra or Kubera, or Yama or even Visnu. I am the destroyer of the destroyer (Yama). I can burn even that which burns (fire). I can infuse Death with the characteristics of death itself. If angry, I can burn the Sun and even fire with my radiance. I can arrest  the speed of the wind instantly with my effort. Akampana, out of fear, implored the inflamed Ravana with folded hands and faltering voice to spare him. The tenheaded Ravana, lord of the demons, assured safety to Akampana, who  gratefully said these words without hesitation: Dasaratha has  a young son,  by name, Rama. He has a body like a lion's. He has strong, round arms and his shoulders resemble those of a bull. He is a hero of great fame and unequal prowess. He has destroyed your Janasthana and also Khara along with Dusana. Having heard Akampana's words, Ravana, the lord of demons, sighed heavily like the king of serpents and said these words: Did Rama come to Janasthana with Indra and the gods ? O Akampana   speak. Hearing Ravana's words, Akampana continued telling about great Rama's strength and his exploits in war. Rama is his name. He looks very radiant. He is the best among the archers. Owner of divine weapons, he is comparable to Indra in war. He is strong with bright red eyes. He has a deep voice with the resonance of a drum. His face is like the moon. Lakshmana, his younger brother, is similar to him in appearance. Rama is prosperous. He is the best among kings. Lakshmana with him is like wind with fire. Rama has pulled down Janasthana. Indeed, they are great men. No god came there (to lend him a hand). There is no need to investigate further about it.  The goldenfeathered arrows released by Rama turned into fivehooded serpents and consumed the demons. Wherever the demons went they, gripped by fear, only saw Rama in front. O sinless sire In this manner your Janasthana was destroyed by him. Wherever the demons went they, gripped by fear, only saw Rama in front. O sinless sire In this manner your Janasthana was destroyed by him. Hearing Akampana's words, Ravana said, I will go to Janasthana and kill Rama along with Lakshmana. Thus said by Ravana, Akampana responded, I will tell you what happened there. O king   listen to the strength and valour of Rama. Rama is of great fame. When outraged, he is irrepressible. He can arrest with his arrows even the speed of a river (in spate). Powerful Rama can pull down the sky along with the planets and stars. He can lift the drowning earth from the depth of the sea. He is so very powerful that he can drown the earth by breaking the boundary of the sea. He can arrest the speed of the sea or of the wind with his arrows. He is a tiger among men. He is so powerful that he can destroy the world and recreate the creatures once again by his valour. O tenheaded one, just as it is not possible for sinners to attain heaven it is not possible for you or for the entire world of demons to win him in war I do not think it is possible for gods and demons together to kill him, yet there is a way for his destruction. You may listen to me with single mindedattention: Rama has a wife in this world, by name, Sita, who is beautiful, has a slender waist and a wellformed body. Adorned with gems, she is a jewel among women, She has no equal among goddesses nor among gandharvis nor apasaras nor among demonesses. How can there be a peer of her among human beings ? Abduct Rama's wife by force in that great forest and bereft of Sita, he will give up his life. Ravana, the strongarmed king of demons, relished the words of Akampana and pondering over the matter, said to him : Yes, early in the morning I will go alone gladly with the charioteer and bring Vaidehi here to this great city. Having said so, Ravana got on a chariot yoked with donkeys. It had the colour of the Sun. It illuminated all directions. Ravana left. The great chariot of the demon king (Ravana) flying in the sky shone like the Moon in the cloud. Ravana reached the hermitage of Maricha and met him who was the son of Tataka. The demon king was treated with food that can be chewed and food that can be eaten. Maricha personally offered Ravana a seat. He offered him water and paid him obeisance. Making meaningful enquiries he said in appropriate words : O lord of demons  O king hope every one is fine in the world of demons. O lord, (though) your sudden arrival puts me in doubt (about everything going right). Having thus been asked by Maricha, glorious Ravana, who was eloquent in speech, spoke to him : O dear, Rama who is capable of doing difficult deeds has killed my sentinels. The indestructible Janasthana has been routed in war. Could you help me in abudcting his wife ? (That is the only way to bring him to his knees). Having heard Ravana ,the king of demons, Maricha said these words:  O king, who is that enemy of yours who, in the guise of a friend,  has told you about Sita? Though obliged by you, who is he that is not happy with you, O tiger among demons? Having heard Ravana ,the king of demons, Maricha said these words:  O king, who is that enemy of yours who, in the guise of a friend,  has told you about Sita? Though obliged by you, who is he that is not happy with you, O tiger among demons? Tell me who asked you to bring Sita ? Who wishes to demolish the peak of the entire clan of demons ? He who has encouraged you in this is your enemy, indeed. He wants you to pluck out the fangs from the serpent's mouth. By  whose action have you been led into this wrong direction? Who has hit you on your forehead while you were sleeping comfortably? Rama is like a mighty tusker. His pure and high birth is his trunk. His wellbuilt and strong arms are his tusks. His brilliance in his ichor. Nobody can face this intoxicated elephant in battle. Rama is a lion in the form of man, a lion on warfront with its tail touching the waist when angry. This lion is deft in killing deer in the form of clever demons. His body is full of arrows. The sharp swords are his pointed teeth. It does not behove you to rouse such a lion who is asleep. O king of demons  it is not proper (for you) to jump into the extremely fierce mouth of the nether world known as Rama. Who can steal the bow from his mighty arms which are whirlpools of mud. His arrows are rows of waves in the flow of the great war. O lord of Lanka, chief of the demons, be pleased to return to Lanka and enjoy yourself in  the company of your wives. Let Rama enjoy with his wife in the forest. Thus advised by Maricha ,the ten headed Ravana returned and entered his best of homes in the city of Lanka .       Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing Dusana, Khara and also Trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by Rama, singlehanded, Surpanakha roared     like a cloud. Seeing Dusana, Khara and also Trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by Rama, singlehanded, Surpanakha roared     like a cloud. Seeing the performance of Rama which is very difficult for others, Surpanakha got scared and went to Lanka, ruled by Ravana. Surpanakha saw Ravana shining brilliantly, seated like Indra along with ministers and Maruts on top of the aerial chariot. Ravana, sitting on the magnificent golden seat on a golden altar looked radiant like the Sun or the blazing fire. Invincible to gods, gandharvas, all living beings, great sages and seers, he was like Yama, lord of death with wide open jaws. He had scars of wounds caused by the thunderbolt received in war between gods and demons, and marks of scars on his chest made by tips of the the tusks of elephant Airavata. Valiant Ravana had an attractive appearance with beautiful dresses twenty arms,ten heads, a broad chest  and brilliant royal marks. Wearing burnished golden earrings, he looked bright like the glittering vaidurya. And with his wellformed arms, white teeth and  wide mouth, he looked like a mountain. He was hit by the wheel of Visnu for hundreds of times during great wars and beaten by other weapons. Ravana whose body was not hurt by the weapons in war with gods, who could perturb even the imperturbable seas, was quick  in action. (He was) one who could lift and throw great mountains, torment even gods, violate  dharma at the root, and cast an evil eye on the wives of others. He who could employ all divine weapons, disrupt sacrifices, had gone to the city of Bhogavati, defeated Vasuki and abducted the dear wife of Takshaka. Ravana went to mount Kailasa, conquered Kubera and took away forcibly his aerial chariot Pushpaka which can fly as per the rider's desire Out of anger he destroyed all the gardens of gods like Chitraratha of Kubera full of lotusponds and Nandana, the pleasuregarden of Indra. He was like the peak of a mountain. He could stop with his arms the great Moon and Sun from rising. He was a scorcher of enemies. This steadfast Ravana who had in the past performed penance for ten thousand years in a dense forest offered his heads to the selfborn Brahma. He was unafraid of death in the hands of gods or demons or gandharvas or pisachas or birds or snakes in war except humans. The mighty Ravana  defiled the sacred Soma juice, worthy of oblations, extracted by Brahmins by chanting mantras in scrifices. He disrupted sacrifices at the final stage. He killed brahmins. He was ruthless, harsh, and  merciless. He was involved in activities against human welfare. That demoness , Surpanakha saw  her very strong,valiant brother Ravana who made all beings cry and created fear in all worlds Resplendently attired, adorned with jewels, wearing beautiful gardlands, seated on a raised throne, he(Ravana) was like death to even the lord of death On reaching Ravana, the lord of demons, the delight of the Paulastya dynasty, and the destroyer of enemies surrounded by ministers, the terrified, Surpanakha said these words: On reaching Ravana, the lord of demons, the delight of the Paulastya dynasty, and the destroyer of enemies surrounded by ministers, the terrified, Surpanakha said these words: Showing her body disfigured by great Lakshmana, Surpanakha, the fearless wanderer, overwhelmed with fear said these cruel words  to Ravana sitting with large, glittering eyes:       Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When the distressed, anguished Surpanakha met Ravana who makes the world weep, he was seated in the midst of his ministers. She addressed him these harsh words: Intoxicated with the pleasures of passion, acting on your own, ungoaded and unguided, you do not understand the problems arising out of great fear, problems you ought to know. Lustful and greedy, you are addicted to vulgar pleasures. People will not respect you like the fire on the crematorium. A king who does not act at the right time will be ruined along with the kingdom and its works. Just as elephants keep away from a muddy river, people will keep distance from the king who does not employ spies, does not give audience to his people and is not independent. Kings who are not under their own control and cannot protect the country, do not attract the minds of the people like mountains inside sea water. Having created enmity with selfrespecting persons like gods, gandharvas and demons, with a fickle mind and without spies how long can you continue as king ? O demon  you are childish and foolish. You do not even know what ought to be known. How can you rule as a king? The best among the victorious kings, who are not masters of their espionage, judicial system and their exchequer are equal to the laity. Since kings can see things from a faroff place with the help of the spies they are called farsighted. Since you have not engaged any spy you do not know when your own relatives were killed in Janasthana. I take you to be a fool surrounded by ordinary ministers. One Rama alone killed all the fourteen thousand demons including Dusana and Khara, demons  capable of fierce exploits. Rama, the effortless performer of formindable tasks, has assured safety to the sages. Peace and happiness was restored to Dandaka forest but Janasthana has been ravaged. O Ravana, you are not aware of what  has happened to your own kingdom. You are avaricious, intoxicated, and under others' control. A great fear has been generated in your own kingdom. All living beings stop seeking refuge under a king who is, not a generous giver, but intoxicated, harsh, arrogant and fraudulent. They do not run to him for protection in times of calamity. A king who is extremely arrogant, who is not acceptable to good people, who is selfconceited and cholerictempered will be murdered even by his own people at the time of adversity. A king who does not do what ought to be done, does not fear what ought to be feared, will surely be dislodged from the kingdom and live a wretched life like a blade of grass. Even dried up logs, or clods of earth, or a handful of dust may have some value but not a king who is dethroned. Like a piece of cloth that is worn and discarded, like garlands put on  and crushed, a king dislodged from the kingdom is worthless even if he is capable. A king who is alert, omniscient, has control over his senses, has a sense of gratitude and one of righteous conduct continues to rule for a long time. The king who keeps both his eyes shut but keeps the eye of justice open, one who is free from anger and remains ever alert, is worshipped by the people. O Ravana you are evilminded. You  are devoid of all these good qualities. Your spies could not know that there had been a great massacre of your fellowdemons. A king who accuses others, who is addicted to sensual pleasures, who lacks a sense of judgement of  place and time, a sense of discrimination between virtue and vice and the right wisdom will destroy himself and the kingdom in no time. Ravana, king of demons, wealthy, arrogant and mighty, listened to Surpanakha and pondered over the mistakes she mentioned.       Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Incensed at the harsh words Surpanakha used in the midst of ministers, Ravana said: Who is Rama? What is his strength? How does he look? How valiant is he? For what purpose has he entered the impenetrable Dandaka forest? With what weapons he has killed demons like Khara, Dusana and Trisira ? Thus questioned by Ravana, the demoness, overcome by anger, began telling him about Rama faithfully: Rama, Dasaratha's son, has long arms, large eyes. He is clad in deerskin and bark. He resembles Cupid. His bow resembles Indra's, He is adorned with gold bands. Drawing the bow, he releases glittering arrows like highly poisonous snakes. I could not see Rama in the dreadful war while he was pulling an arrow from the quiver, aiming the dart, and drawing the bowstring. Just as Indra destroys the crop ready for harvest by raining hailstones, I have seen Rama killing the army with a shower of arrows. Fighting alone on foot with his sharp arrows Rama killed within a span of one and a half muhurta, the fourteen thousand dreadful demons including Dusana and Khara. Sages have been assured safety. Peace has been restored to Dandaka forest. As Rama, the great soul, who knows the self, hesitated to kill a woman, I was alone saved after this humiliation. Sages have been assured safety. Peace has been restored to Dandaka forest. As Rama, the great soul, who knows the self, hesitated to kill a woman, I was alone saved after this humiliation. His brother called Lakshmana looks radiant. He is virtuous and courageous like him, valiant, devoted and loyal. He is impatient, invincible, victorious, bold, intelligent and strong. He is even the right hand of Rama, his outer life. Rama's beloved consort is a largeeyed lady. Her face is like the full moon. She is engaged in the wellbeing of her husband. She is an illustrious lady. She is goodlooking with her long hair, wellshaped nose and things. She appears to be the presiding deity of the forest, another goddess of wealth (Laxmi). She is Sita, princess of Videha, a virtuous lady of golden complexion, a beautiful lady of slender waist and heavy hips. I had not seen such a beautiful woman earlier, among the gandharvas, or yakshas, or kinneras. I have not seen such a beauty among the humans on earth. Whosoever gets Sita as his wife, whoever she embraces happily will wish to live longer than Indra, the breaker of fortresses in this world. She is a woman of good conduct, of praiseworthy beauty. She is matchless in her beauty on earth. She will be a suitable wife for you and you, a suitable husband for her. O mightyarmed one  I have been disfigured by cruel Lakshmana as I was attempting to bring that lady of broad thighs, pointed breasts, heavy hips and a beautiful face to make her your wife. If you see her today, this lady with a face like the fullmoon, you will (instantaneously) fall a victim to the arrows of the god of love. If you intend her to be your wife, raise your right foot now and proceed to win her over. O lord of the demons, do a favour to your clan by  killing that cruel Rama dwelling in the hermitage. Kill Rama, that great warrior along with Lakshmana with sharp arrows and enjoy the  company of Sita happily as you like, with her husband dead. If you like what I have said, do accordingly without any hesitation, O Ravana, lord of the demons. Assess your own strength, O Lord of the demons, before you forcefully abduct that delicate Sita who is charming in all respects and make her your wife. On hearing about the death of the demons including Khara and Dusana who fell to the straight and swift arrows of Rama, you should decide your course of action.       Thus ends the thirtytfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then hearing the horripilating words of Surpanakha, Ravana took leave of the ministers and went thinking about the task ahead of him. Deliberating on the task ahead, duly considering the pros and cons, demerits and merits, strength and weakness, of the issue and having firmly decided within himself, he left for the beautiful coachshed. Deliberating on the task ahead, duly considering the pros and cons, demerits and merits, strength and weakness, of the issue and having firmly decided within himself, he left for the beautiful coachshed. Ravana went covertly to the coachshed and to the charioteer to get a chariot harnessed. Thus ordered, the smart charioteer got the chariot of his choice harnessed in an instant. The younger brother of Kubera (Ravana), the prosperous lord of the demons ascended the chariot which could go where he desired. Embellished with gold, studded with gems, harnessed with demonfaced donkeys, the chariot rolled towards the ocean, rumbling like a cloud.

Valiant Ravana wentwatching the mountains full of thousands of trees bearing flowers and fruits on the shore of the sea. (The area) surrounded on all sides with lotusladen ponds filled with cool, sacred water, sprawling hermitages with elevated altars. The place covered with banana plants and coconut trees  as well as blossoming sal and tamala trees was looking extremely beautiful. The place looked charming with nagas, garudas, gandharvas, kinneras in their thousands and with the descendants of ajas, vaikhanasas, valakhilyas and with those who drink the rays of Sun and Moon for survival, with  sages who were highly disciplined in the intake of food,  spiritually accomplished  and selfcontrolled hermits and charanas.

(The place was) full of apsaras  in their thousands and paragons of beauty adorned with divine ornaments and garlands, and experts in lovesports. It was chosen by prosperous wives of gods as a reosrt. Hosts of gods and demons were wandering, there in the hope of tasting nectar.

It had stretches of vaidurya stones on the shore and shone with the radiance of the sea Speeding along, the brother of Kubera (Ravana) saw palewhite, spacious aerial chariots on all sides controlled by those who had conquered the higher worlds by their penances. These chariots, decked with heavenly garlands, and ringing with divine music could fly where one desired. He saw gandharvas and apsaras as well.

These chariots, decked with heavenly garlands, and ringing with divine music could fly where one desired. He saw gandharvas and apsaras as well. He saw thousands of tree trunks with finesmelling resins and sandalwood trees. (He saw) very fine aguru trees in the forest as well as pleasuregroves of takkola fruits, fragrant  trees of a fine variety and fragrant nutmegs. (He saw) tamala flowers in bloom, pepper shrubs in clusters and hoards of pearls kept for drying on the shores. He saw stretches of conches, heaps of corals and mounds of gold and silver too. He went watching fascinating waterfalls, pleasing ponds, cities filled with wealth and grain, looking splendid with beautiful women and full of elephants, horses and chariots. It was a veritable heaven with the plain land flooded with the backwaters of the sea and gentle breeze blowing. He saw a banyan tree with its branches spread on all sides measuring a hundred yojanas, looking like a cloud and providing shelter to the sages. In the past, the mighty Garuda brought an elephant and a huge tortoise and sat on a branch of this tree to feed on them. Due to the weight of this best of birds, the mighty Garuda, the leafy branch at once broke down. Gathered together under the great tree were great sages like vaikhanasas, mashas, marichipas, valakhilyas, ajas and dhumras. Out of compassion for the (endangered) seers Garuda carried away that hundredyojanalong branch along with the elephant and the tortoise with great speed. Righteous Garuda, the best among the birds, stood on one foot and ate the flesh (of elephant and tortoise) and  with the branch of the tree, destroyed the settlement of the demons. Over the destruction of the demons and deliverance of the great seers he felt immeasurable happiness.

Over the destruction of the demons and deliverance of the great seers he felt immeasurable happiness. Quite happy, his energy redoubled, wise Garuda made up his mind to obtain nectar. Twisting and twirling the grills of the window, he broke open the room made of gems and quietly carried away the nectar from Indra's mansion. Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera, beheld that banyan tree called Subhadram ,which was a favoured resort of the sages bearing the ensignia of Garuda. Ravana crossed over to the other side of the sea, the lord of rivers, and beheld a hermitage in a beautiful, secluded, sacred  place in the middle of the forest. There he saw a demon Maricha, by name, clad in dark deerskin and bark ,with matted hair and living on restricted food. When king Ravana reached there, Maricha received him  in accordance with tradition  and made worshipful offering to the king, fulfilling all his superhuman desires. Maricha extended his hospitality with appropriate food and water and said with meaningful words: O king  O lord of the demons  hope all is well in Lanka. What brings you here again so soon ? Thus addressed by Maricha, the effulgent, eloquent Ravana replied with these words:       Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O dear Maricha hear my words. I am distressed and you are my ultimate refuge. You know that my brothers, Khara and Dusana, the strongarmed heroes, my sister Surpanakha and  the mighty cannibal Trisira, and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents. They have been harassing the followers of righteous path (the sages) at my behest. You know that my brothers, Khara and Dusana, the strongarmed heroes, my sister Surpanakha and  the mighty cannibal Trisira, and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents. They have been harassing the followers of righteous path (the sages) at my behest. You know that my brothers, Khara and Dusana, the strongarmed heroes, my sister Surpanakha and  the mighty cannibal Trisira, and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents. They have been harassing the followers of righteous path (the sages) at my behest. These fourteen thousand heroes, perpetrators of terrible deeds, skilled in hitting the targets had been acting according to the direction of Khara. These mighty demons, living in Janasthana, eqipped with different kinds of weapons, supported and led by Khara, met Rama in an encounter. With his wrath generated, Rama, without even speaking anything, used his bow and the arrows. Being a human being who fought on foot, he killed fourteen thousand ferocious demons with his sharp arrows. Khara, Dusana and Trisira were killed in war.The residents of Dandaka forest are rendered safe and fearless. Rama, a victim of his father's anger, banished into the forest with his wife, a shortlived mortal and a calumny on the kshatriyas has killed the army of demons. He is a man of bad conduct, harsh, sharptonged, stupid, miserly and a slave to his senses. He is immoral and unrighteous, one who is busy harming others. With no enmity whatsoever, merely because he has strength, he cut off the nose and ears of my sister and mutilated her. His wife Sita  is like the daughter of heaven. I would like to abduct her with force from Janasthana for which you should be my accomplice. With no enmity whatsoever, merely because he has strength, he cut off the nose and ears of my sister and mutilated her. His wife Sita  is like the daughter of heaven. I would like to abduct her with force from Janasthana for which you should be my accomplice. You are mighty. I do not care to fight even the gods when you and my brothers are by my side. Therefore, O demon, be my accomplice. (I know) you are capable of that. You are mighty. I do not care to fight even the gods when you and my brothers are by my side. Therefore, O demon, be my accomplice. (I know) you are capable of that. In valour,  in war and in conceit there is no one equal to you. You know all means (of success). You are great. You are brave. You are an expert in all deceitful arts. I have come to you for this purpose seeking your help. Listen to  my words on what you should do: Be a wonderful golden deer dappled with silver dots and roam in front of Sita in Rama's hermitage. Seeing you in the form of a deer, Sita will undoubtedly ask her husband and Lakshmana to capture you. Then during their absence it will be easy for me to abduct Sita in an isolated place without obstruction, like Rahu eclipsing the light of the moon. Thereafter, when Rama with his soul afflicted due to his wife's abduction. I can freely, happily, successfully strike him down. At the mention of Rama's name, great Maricha's mouth dried up and he became concerned. Licking his dried up lips, as though his eyes stopped winking like those of the dead, Maricha stared at Ravana, distressed. Maricha who knows of Rama's valour was frightened and depressed at heart. He revealed to Ravana with folded hands some facts for mutual benefit.        Thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard the words of Ravana, lord of the demons, wise Maricha who was also an eloquent speaker replied: O king, it is always easy to find men who speak pleasing words, but it is difficult to get a speaker and a listener who use words unpleasant (to the ears) but beneficial (in life). You  are fickleminded.  You have employed no spy ( who could have told you the truth about Rama's character). Rama is very brave and virtuous comparable to Indra and Varuna. Surely you are not able to know what Rama is. O dear may there be good to all the demons in the world. If Rama gets enraged, he will make this world demonless. Hope the daughter of Janaka is not born to put an end to your life. Hope I will not face any disaster on account of Sita. I hope the city of Lanka along with the (entire) race of demons will not be destroyed, with a dictator like you who is a slave to sensual pleasure. A king  who is a slave to passion, who is of bad conduct, of wicked thoughts, advised in evil ways destroys himself, his kith and kin and the entire kingdom. Rama, the delight of Kausalya, has not forsaken by his father. He has never crossed the limits of dharma. He is not miserly. He has no  bad conduct. He is not a slur on the kshatriyas. He does not lack in righteousness. He is not cruel nor is he engaged in doing harm to others. Rama, the delight of Kausalya, has not forsaken by his father. He has never crossed the limits of dharma. He is not miserly. He has no  bad conduct. He is not a slur on the kshatriyas. He does not lack in righteousness. He is not cruel nor is he engaged in doing harm to others. O dear, seeing that his truthful father was going to be deceived by Kaikeyi, righteous Rama himself offered to fulfil the promise of his father and came away to the forest. To satisfy the desire of Kaikeyi and to fulfil his father's word he came to Dandaka forest,  leaving the kingdom and all royal pleasures, behind. O my dear, Rama is not harsh nor ignorant. It is not that he has no control over the senses. It is not proper  for you to say what is false. You are illinformed. Rama is dharma incarnate. He is pious. His strength is truth. He is king of all the worlds like Indra to the gods. Sita is protected by the strength of her character. How do you desire to carry her away forcibly (from Rama) ? Can any one separate the radiance of the Sun from the Sun itself ? You should not enter into the unquenchable fire that is  Rama,  the fire that has the  arrows (of Rama) as its flames and his sword and bow as fuel. You should not give up happiness,your dear life and kingdom and come to Rama who is a variable god of death. His bow is  like on open burning mouth, and his flaming arrows are like fire. He is all anger. He is wielder of bow and arrows. He can strike the enemy army (alone). You should not give up happiness,your dear life and kingdom and come to Rama who is a variable god of death. His bow is  like on open burning mouth, and his flaming arrows are like fire. He is all anger. He is wielder of bow and arrows. He can strike the enemy army (alone). Immeasurable indeed is the power of Rama to whom Sita, daughter of Janaka belongs. You are not competent to kidnap her, for she is under the refuge of Rama's bow in the forest. Beautiful Sita happens to be the wife of Rama who is like a lion among men. Rama has a broad chest like that of a lion. He loves Sita who is ever loyal to him, more than his life. Sita is the darling of mighty Rama. With her slender waist, she is like the leaping flames of blazing fire and it is not possible  for you to touch her. O chief of the demons, why do you make this futile attempt ? The moment you are seen by Rama in war will be the last of your life. If you want to enjoy your life, happiness and even the kingdom which is not easily attainable for long, do not incur the displeasure of Rama. After consulting all your ministers and the righteous persons led by Vibhisana, you may take a decision. Assess the real strength and weakness, merits and demerits  of your own and of Rama. Decide what is good or bad for you and then take steps you deem proper. After consulting all your ministers and the righteous persons led by Vibhisana, you may take a decision. Assess the real strength and weakness, merits and demerits  of your own and of Rama. Decide what is good or bad for you and then take steps you deem proper. O Ravana  I think it is not good on your part to confront the prince of Kosala in a war. Listen to my words and consider what is good for you.

                "Once I was roaming the earth, like a mountain possessing the  strength of a thousand elephants, like a dark cloud, wearing bright gold earrings and crown,holding a spear in hand, terrorising the people. I was wandering in Dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics. Once I was roaming the earth, like a mountain possessing the  strength of a thousand elephants, like a dark cloud, wearing bright gold earrings and crown,holding a spear in hand, terrorising the people. I was wandering in Dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics. Hence the great sage, righteous Visvamitra afraid of me, went to king Dasaratha  and said: 'O king Maricha has created in me a great fear. Spare the self possessed Rama to protect me while I do the sacrifice.' When the great, venerable sage Visvamitra said so, the righteous king Dasaratha replied: 'My son Rama is only twelve. He is not experienced in the use of weapons. I shall accompany you with my army. 'O distinguished sage with the four divisions of my army I will slay the enemies you want me to.' When  the king thus responded to the sage,  he told him that none other than Rama in this world is a match for that demon. 'O king, you have protected even gods in wars and have been a guardian. Your deeds are very wellknown in the three worlds. 'O scourge of foes as you wish, let your great army wait here. Even though Rama is young he is glorious, and capable of subduing the enemy. I will take him. Be blessed.' 'O scourge of foes as you wish, let your great army wait here. Even though Rama is young he is glorious, and capable of subduing the enemy. I will take him. Be blessed.' Sage Visvamitra saying so took the son of the king and went back very happily to his hermitage. Then Rama was initiated for the protection of sacrifices and stood on guard, stretching his wonderful bow. Thereafter, handsome Rama, with eyes like lotus petals, beards ungrown, clad in a single garment with knotted hair on the head, wielding a bow, with a chain of gold, luminous with his own lustre enhanced the glory of Dandaka forest by looking like the young moon just risen. Thereafter, handsome Rama, with eyes like lotus petals, beards ungrown, clad in a single garment with knotted hair on the head, wielding a bow, with a chain of gold, luminous with his own lustre enhanced the glory of Dandaka forest by looking like the young moon just risen. Then looking like a dark cloud, wearing bright golden earrings, proud of power bestowed on me with boons, I arrived at the hermitage. I entered at once and lifted my weapons. Rama saw me and unperturbed, started stringing his bow. Out of my delusion I underestimated the young boy, and screaming, ran towards Visvamitra's sacrificial altar. Then Rama released a sharp arrow that could kill the enemy. It struck me and threw me at a distance of hundred yojanas into the sea. O dear being thrown away by the speed of his dart I lost my consciousness. I was protected by Rama who did not want to kill me. O dear I was thrown into the deep sea and after a long time regained consciousness and  returned to the city of Lanka. That way I was spared by the young boy who was not versed in archery and who could still accomplish the task with ease.Those who accompanied me were destroyed. If you pick up conflict with Rama even while being warned by me you will soon face a dreadful calamity. You will bring grief and disaster into the lives of demons who are sporting in love and who are in the habit of celebrating community festivals with joy. You will see the city of Lanka dotted with magnificent royal mansions embellished  with different kinds of gems ruined for the sake of Sita. Even without committing any sin those pure souls because they keep company with sinners will be destroyed for the sins of others just like fishes in a pool of serpents. You will see the demons who smear their limbs with sandal paste and unguents, who are adorned with excellent ornaments slain and laid on the ground for your mistakes. You will see the rest of the demons with their wives gone or fleeing in all directions helplessly with none to take care of them. You will undoubtedly see Lanka filled with arrows, surrounded by flames of fire and its buildings on fire. O king there is no sin greater than violating the chastity of others wives, when you have married a thousand lovely women. Enjoy with your wives. Protect your race, prestige, kingdom, prosperity and your own dear life. If you wish to enjoy your beautiful wives and your good friends for long, do not create enmity with Rama. If you violate Sita forcibly notwithstanding my friendly warning, your life will be drained by the arrows of Rama and you will reach the abode of Yama with your kith and kin, your strength depleted.       Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "I was somehow saved by him this way in the combat.Listen without any reply to what has taken place recently. Having done so, I picked up courage and entered Dandaka forest, accompanied by the two other demons in the form of deer . I wandered in Dandaka forest in the form of a huge animal with a big and strong body, a flaming red tongue and sharp teeth feeding on flesh. O Ravana, assuming a very dreadful form, I wandered about sacrificial spots, sacred places, river banks, under huge trees planted at quadranglestorturing the ascetics. I wandered  about the Dandaka forest slaying righteous ascetics, drinking their blood and eating their flesh. While thus roaming, I harmed the wanderers of the forest. Intoxicated with their blood I used to frighten the righteous. I encountered again the righteous Rama who was in the form of an ascetic, with venerable Sita and the great warrior Lakshmana. Although Rama was very strong, he was living on restricted diet, engaged in the welfare of all beings. Treating him as a mere ascetic living in the forest, remembering my past hostility with him and disregarding his (fatal) blow, I ran towards him angrily, assuming the form of a sharphorned animal with an intention to kill him. Although Rama was very strong, he was living on restricted diet, engaged in the welfare of all beings. Treating him as a mere ascetic living in the forest, remembering my past hostility with him and disregarding his (fatal) blow, I ran towards him angrily, assuming the form of a sharphorned animal with an intention to kill him. His mighty bow drawn, Rama released three sharp darts that came whizzing like Garuda or the wind. They could destroy the enemy. All the three tightly jointed, welltargetted darts, strong as thunderbolt, and which could feed on blood came together all at once. Having known Rama's prowess earlier and experienced tremendous fear, I ran away in a bewildered state as I was deceitful. The other two demons (who had accompanied me) succumbed. With my escape from Rama's darts I somehow got a fresh lease of life. Now I am composed. I have started living the life of a recluse here. I have turned an ascetic. I see Rama in every tree, clad in bark and deerskin, wielding the bow, holding a noose in hand like the god of death. O Ravana I see in my fear thousands of Ramas. The entire forest appears to me as though filled with Rama. O king of the demons  I see only Rama even in solitude. When I see him in a dream  I lose my senses in a state of bewilderment. O Ravana, every name beginning with the letter 'Ra', such as Ratna (gems), Ratha (chariot), etc. strike terror in me. I know his power.It is not proper to wage a war with him. Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, can slay even Bali or Namuchi. Missing There were many pious men in this world who practise yoga and dharma .They have been destroyed along with their retinue due to mistakes committed by others. O demon   As such, I will perish due to your offence. You may do anything you deem appropriate. I will not follow you. Rama is brilliant, powerful and strong. I hope he will not be the god of death for the world of demons. For the sake of Surpanakha, Khara of Janasthana committed excesses and got killed by Rama who can accomplish things with ease.Tell me truly if Rama did violate anything here. For the sake of Surpanakha, Khara of Janasthana committed excesses and got killed by Rama who can accomplish things with ease.Tell me truly if Rama did violate anything here. If you do not follow my advice given for the welfare of our kith and kin, O Ravana, you are killed today. With your relations you will succumb to his straightmoving arrows.       Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The demon Ravana did not heed the appropriate advice of the competent Maricha just like a man wishing to die refuses medicine. The king of the demons, driven by fate, replied with improper and harsh words to Maricha whose advice was salutary and beneficial to him : O Maricha, the words addressed to me are not appropriate.Your advice is extremely fruitless like a seed sown in saline, barren soil. It is not possible to dissuade me from my encounter with Rama who is sinful, foolish and especially an ordinary human being. On hearing the casual words of a woman, (this) Rama came to the forest at once, leaving his friends, kingdom, mother and father. In your very presence I will surely abduct Sita, wife of Rama who killed Khara in war, Sita whom he loves more than his life. O Maricha  I have made up my mind that way. Even demons or deities including Indra cannot alter this decision of mine. If I asked you the merits or demerits, the risks involved or the way out while deciding a case, you should have said what you did. A wise counsellor should give advice to the king only when his opinion is sought and that too with folded hands, if he wishes his own prosperity. A king should be addressed with politeness and decorum, with words not unfavourble intended for his good luck and wellbeing. A king who deserves honour does not feel happy to hear even good words of advice if said in disrespectful or authoritarian way, O Maricha Very powerful kings assume five forms like fire, Indra, Moon, Varuna and Yama. Great kings possess heat, (of the firegod), valour (of Indra), coolness (of the Moon), command (of Varuna) and grace (of the Lord of death). Therefore kings at all stages deserve respect and reverence. You do not know your rightful duty.Because of delusion and an evil mind, you want to speak only harsh words to me, a guest who has come to you. O demon  O extremely valiant demon  I ask you(to do) this much now. I am not asking you whether it is good or bad or whether it is for my welfare or not. You have to help me in accomplishing this great task .Hear me on the kind of work you have to do. Missing Transform yourself into a wonderful golden deer with silver spots and move about in front of Sita at the hermitage of Rama. After fascinating her, you may go whereever you desire. Seeing the illusory golden deer, Sita, wonderstruck, will at once ask Rama to get the deer. Divert Rama to a faroff place and cry, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana',  imitating the voice of Rama. On hearing you, Lakshmana will be bewildered. Urged by Sita and out of love for Rama, Lakshmana will follow the same track as Rama. When Rama and Lakshmana are away I will comfortably abduct Vaidehi like the thousandeyed Indra brought Sachi. You may go wherever you want after accomplishing this task. I will give you, O demon of determination half my kingdom. Go and accomplish this task. Let your path be auspicious. I will follow you on the chariot into the Dandaka forest. I will deceive Rama and obtain Sita, without waging a war. With the work done, I will return to Lanka along with you. O Maricha if you do not do this, I will kill you now. Or, by force make you do this work. No one who goes against the king lives in comfort. Your survival is doubtful after facing Rama in combat. But your death is certain if you oppose me now. Think carefuly and do whatever is desirable for you in the present circumstances.       Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "At this royal command which was against his interest Maracha used harsh words to the demonking: Who is that sinner who has given you this advice which will spell destruction on you, your sons, your kingdom and your ministers ? Which sinner is not able to see you happy? O king by whom is this gate of death shown to you cunningly? This is clear that your enemy demons are now powerless. Hence they want you to be engaged with a stronger power and be destroyed. O Ravana by which mean fellow is this advice given against your welfare? Who wants you to be destroyed by your own action. O Ravana the ministers should have prevented you by all means from adopting this  wrong path. Since they have not done so, they deserve to be spain. Good ministrers should always prevent a lustful king from taking resourse to an evil path. Why were you not stopped, even though you deserve to be checked. O Ravana  the best among the successful ministers attain piety, prosperity, pleasures and fame by the grace of the king. Otherwise evrything will become useless, O Ravana  Others will suffer calamities on account of their master's vices. O Ravana, the best among the victorious indeed the king is at the root of righteousness and victory.Therefore, the king should be protected by all at every stage. O nightwalking demon  a kingdom cannnot be governed by a king who is rude or hostile or impolite. Ministers who adopt improper strategies go down along with the king just like swift horses driven by a slow charioteer on a rugged terrain. Persons who walk the righteous path go down in this world along with their kith and kin due to the mistakes committed by others . O Ravana, people who are ruled by a cruel and hostile king will not grow like the sheep protected by a jackal. Under a rude, crooked king whose senses are not under his control the demons will surely perish. I am faced with  this dreadful disaster accidentally. You will not only be in a miserable state because of your misdeeds, you will perish along with your army. Rama will kill you not long after killing me.Hence even if I die in the hands of the enemy, my desire will be fulfilled. Yu most understand that if I die at the very sight of Rama, you along with your relatives will perish with the abduction of Sita. If you bring Sita from the hermitage with my assistance, know that none of us will surviveyou nor I, nor Lanka , nor the demons. O Ravana, you do not understand this word of warning coming from your wellwisher. Men who are going to die do not heed the advice given by their friends.       Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having thus spoken to the demonking, the distressed Maricha said out of fear, Let both of us go. If that warrior Rama carrying bow, arrows and sword sees me once again he will raise his weapon to kill me, and I will cease to be. No one who exhibits his heroism before Rama will come back alive. To you, already hit by Yama's staff, he is another form of the same Yama. What can I do if you remain evilminded? O dear demon, I am going. May your path be auspicious Ravana was so overwhelmed with joy to hear those words that he embraced him tightly and said:. Act according to my wish. It befits your valour. You were a different demon earlier. Now you are Maricha. Ascend quickly with me this chariot encrusted with gems and yoked with donkeys with devils' faces You may go whereever you like after tempting Vaidehi. When the princess of Mithila  is alone, I will bring her by force. Thereafter Ravana and Maricha ascended the chariot, which was like an aerial car, and quickly departed from that cluster of hermitages. And likewise, they went past towns, forests, mountains, streams, states and cities. Ravana, king of the demons, accompanied by Maricha, then reached Dandaka forest and saw Rama's hermitage. Then Ravana got off the chariot decorated with golden embellishments and, holding Maricha's hand, said:. O friend here is the site of the hermitage surrounded by banana plants. Quickly get to work on the purpose for which we have come. Hearing Ravana's words, Maricha transformed himself into a deer and started moving at the entrance of Rama's hermitage. Maricha assumed the form of a wonderful and magnificent deer with his antlers studded with the most precious gems, his face dappled with luminous spots of white and  black. The deer's face was like a pink lotus, his ears were like blue lotus. His neck slightly raised, his lips were like petals of blue lotus. His bright belly was shining like kunda flowers or the Moon or diamond. His flanks were like the golden madhuka flowers. comparable to the filaments of lotus. His hooves were like vaidurya, and his legs were slim and willshaped. His tail stood up looking magnificent like a colourful rainbow. Bedecked with various gems, he shone beautiful. Transformed into a most beautiful deer in a moment, Maricha brightened the beautiful forest and Rama's hermitage. Transfigured into a beautiful, magnificent form painted with the colours of different minerals in order to tempt Sita, Maricha roamed all around the grassland. Transfigured into a beautiful, magnificent form painted with the colours of different minerals in order to tempt Sita, Maricha roamed all around the grassland. That deer with hundreds of silver spots on the body appeared enchanting and pleasing to the eyes while he wandered about nibbling the tender leaves of trees. The deer went wandering about the banana groves surrounding Rama's hermitage and moved slowly towards the karnikara trees in order to catch the attention of Sita. That magnificent deer glittered with the colour of blue lotus on its back, wandered merrily in the vicinity of Rama's hermitage. The wonderful deer moved to and fro, now disappearing and now swiftly returning. The deer is now sporting, now sitting on the ground, now standing at the entrance of the hermitage and now running with the herds of deer. Followed by herds of deer and coming back to see Sita again and again, the deer cavorted and pranced and frisked in circles in a wonderful way. Seeing the deer, other animals wandering in the forest come near and sniffing him run away in all ten directions. The demon who was interested in killing wild deer touched and felt them but did not kill or feed on them in order to hide his intention. In the mean time Sita who, with her auspicious looks, was busy plucking flowers drew near the trees. With her bewitching eyes and beautiful face, Sita, went about plucking flowers from karnikara, ashoka and mango trees. The great lady Sita, unworthy of dwelling in the forest, saw the wonderful deer decked with gems, with  spots of pearls all over the body. A lady with beautiful teeth and lips, Sita saw the deer having silver and mineral coloured hair on the body. She gazed at the animal with wonder and joy and love. That illusory deer saw Rama's wife and moved around wonderfully as if illuminating the forest with his radiance. Seeing such  an unprecedented deer decorated with different gems, Sita, daughter of Janaka, stood amazed.       Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita while plucking flowers Sita who had fine hips, flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body. She called out to Rama and Lakshmana who were equipped with arms. Sita while plucking flowers Sita who had fine hips, flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body. She called out to Rama and Lakshmana who were equipped with arms. When Sita called Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, they looked around and saw the deer. Seeing the deer, Lakshmana suspected him to be Maricha and said this to Rama. Many kings, while on hunting expedition in the forest, have been deceitfully killed by malicious Maricha, who could assume any form at his free will. O tiger among men, this deceitful demon (Maricha) has been transformed into the illusory form of a radiant deer which does not exist. O Rama, lord of the world nowhere on earth does exist this kind of wonderful deer sparkling with gems. That it is a mere trick, an illusion there is no doubt. Sita was too enchanted by the skin of the deer to retain her sense of discrimination. Intervening, she said to Rama joyfully with a pure smile on her face: O prince O longarmed one, this deer has captivated my mind. Fetch him for  me.This  will be our playmate. Here at the hermitage there are many lovely deer, yaks and antelopes wandering in herds. O longarmed one, most beautiful animals like bears, antelopes and groups of monkeys and kinneras are wandering here. O prince  this kind of beautiful, tame and glittering deer I have never seen before. Its body glittering with different colours, speckled with gems of different kinds, is like the Moon shining and illuminating the forest. Oh what a beauty, Oh what rich call  what delightful, wonderful, graceful limbs  This deer captivates my heart. If this deer can be caught  alive, it will be thrilling, it will work wonders. After the completion  of exile in the forest, when we are back in the kingdom, this deer will add beauty to the harem. O king this deer will create amazement in Bharata, in mothersinlaw, in you and in me as well. O best among men, if this great deer cannot be captured alive, I will wear its beautiful skin. If this animal is killed and its golden skin is spread on a tender grass cushion, there will I like to sit. This kind of request arising out of a woman's desire may sound terrible, still then the beauty of this animal's skin has produced in me a wonder. By his golden colour resembling the rising Sun, by  his horns with excellent gems shining like the milkyway, even Rama's mind was wonderstruck. On hearing Sita's words and seeing the wonderful deer, Rama was tempted by its appearance.Prompted by Sita,he joyfully said this to Lakshmana: On hearing Sita's words and seeing the wonderful deer, Rama was tempted by its appearance.Prompted by Sita,he joyfully said this to Lakshmana: O Lakshmana, see the eagerness of Sita. Such a deer of exceptional beauty will not be found in this forest. There is no equal to this animal even in the Nandan garden of Indra, or the Chaitraratha, the garden of Kubera. Where can such an animal be found on earth? O Lakshmana, see the eagerness of Sita. Such a deer of exceptional beauty will not be found in this forest. There is no equal to this animal even in the Nandan garden of Indra, or the Chaitraratha, the garden of Kubera. Where can such an animal be found on earth? The stretches of hair on the deer's body bent both in the natural order and in the opposite direction look beautiful. The spots of gold on the skin are wonderful. Look at his tongue stretched out of the mouth while yawning. It is glowing like flaming fire. It is like the lightning sparkling in the cloud. His face is a drinking pot of emerald, the belly is a conch or a pearl. Whose mind will not be attracted by this indescribable beauty ? Whose mind will not be filled with wonder on seeing this divine beauty glittering like lustrous gold and studded with a variety of gems ? O Lakshmana kings who wield  bows  in hunting expeditions kill deer in the forest for sport as well as for venison. From huge forests a variety of mineral wealth consisting of gems, stones and gold are collected with great effort. O Lakshmana the essence of forest wealth is mineral wealth, which helps the growth of the treasury. It is conceived mentally as in the case of Venus. A materialist moves about thoughtlessly for making money. Economists call it material wealth. The skins of various types of deer like Priyaki, Kadali or goats or sheep cannot be compared in softness to the skin of this deer. This majestic deer and the deer flying in heaven (the deer's figure seen in the Moon called Mrgasira)  both the deer of the star in the sky and the deer of the earth are divine. Lakshmana, as you say, if it is the illusion of a demon, even then it should be killed by me. The great sages were tortured and killed earlier by this cruel, evilminded Maricha while wandering in the forest. Many kings who were great archers who set out on hunting expedition were killed by him. Therefore, this animal deserves to be killed. Earlier in this forest, Vatapi used to humiliate the ascetic brahmins and to kill them by entering into their stomach like a womb killing the female mule. That Vatapi after a long time, once greedily entered into the stomach of the great lustrous sage Agastya and became his food. When the venerable sage Agastya got up (after eating), he observed Vatapi wishing to turn into his real form. So smiling at him, he said: 'O Vatapi you killed the best of brahmins living in this world, disregarding them because of your power. Hence you were digested by me.' O Lakshmana just like Vatapi, this demon will not live. Whoever violates a person of my kind who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled will be killed O Lakshmana, delight of the Raghu dynasty, be very alert and restrained and protect Sita. Whatever duty we have to perform depends on her protection. O Lakshmana I will go quickly and either kill the deer or catch it.  Now let me go. See, how Vaidehi ardently longs for the skin of this deer  I will not let the animal live, O Lakshmana Keep vigil over Sita at the hermitage, O Lakshmana  I will certainly kill the speckled antelope with a single arrow, get his skin and come back quickly. Keep vigil over Sita at the hermitage, O Lakshmana  I will certainly kill the speckled antelope with a single arrow, get his skin and come back quickly. O Lakshmana, be vigilant in guarding Sita, suspecting danger every moment from all directions. Take the help of Jatayu, the mighty and wise bird who will be on his rounds.       Thus ends the fortythird sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The brilliant Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, thus instructed his brother and fastened a sword with a golden handle to his waist. A man of indomitable prowess, he took the bow with three curves that was like an ornament to him, tied two quivers at the back and left. On seeing Rama approaching him, the deer disappeared due to fear and again came within sight. With his sword and the bow, Rama chased wherever the deer ran. Rama, wielder of the bow, saw that splendid animal ahead of him. Holding the bow he saw the deer running away, bewldered into the great forest looking at him again and again. The deer was getting out of the range of his arrow, while it enticed him now and then. Suspecting that he might be caught,  the deer was, as though jumping into the sky. Now it came within sight and now out of sight in the huge forest. It looked like the autumnal moon surrounded by clouds. (The clouds muffle the Moon and reveal him now and then).

Maricha, transformed into a deer, was seen now near, now faroff. He pulled Rama away from the hermitage through his exits and entrances. Maricha, transformed into a deer, was seen now near, now faroff. He pulled Rama away from the hermitage through his exits and entrances. Deluded by that deer, Rama got tired, perplexed and angry. Then bewidered, he waited on a grassland under a shade. That demon transformed himself into a deer and, surrounded by the animals of the forest at close range, attracted his attention. Seeing Rama's  intention to catch him, the deer ran away once again out of fear and disappeared in a moment. Resplendent Rama saw the deer coming out of a cluster of trees at a distance and determined to kill him. Powerful Rama, destroyer of foes, lifted in a rage his arrow blazing like the light of  the Sun, strung it to his sturdy bow and drew it with all his force. He then aimed at the deer and released the shining  arrow created by Brahma which went hissing like a  serpent. Powerful Rama, destroyer of foes, lifted in a rage his arrow blazing like the light of  the Sun, strung it to his sturdy bow and drew it with all his force. He then aimed at the deer and released the shining  arrow created by Brahma which went hissing like a  serpent. The great arrow which was like a thunderbolt first pierced into the body of Maricha who had assumed the form of a deer and then tore his heart. And, hurt by the dart, Maricha roared frighteningly, leaped as high as a  palm tree  and dropped down on earth almost dead. Maricha gave up his false form of the deer and before breathing his last, remembered the words of Ravana. He thought over the means through which Sita could send Lakshmana to this spot so that  Ravana would abduct her when she is alone. Maricha gave up his false form of the deer and before breathing his last, remembered the words of Ravana. He thought over the means through which Sita could send Lakshmana to this spot so that  Ravana would abduct her when she is alone. Then Maricha realised that the appropriate time had come. In a voice similar to Rama's, he shouted loudly 'Alas Sita, Alas Lakshmana ' Struck in the vital part by Rama's matchless dart, Maricha gave up the form of the deer and assumed his huge body of the demon. Seeing that terrific demon fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, and strring his limbs, Rama thought of Lakshmana's words and reached Sita mentally (thought of her). Seeing that terrific demon fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, and strring his limbs, Rama thought of Lakshmana's words and reached Sita mentally (thought of her). This is an illusion created by Maricha. It happened exactly the way Lakshmana had said earlier. Maricha is now killed. This demon Maricha screamed aloud saying, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana'. He is now dead. How would Sita react to this voice? What would be the condition of Lakshmana? While righteous Rama reflected on this, his hair stood on end. This demon Maricha screamed aloud saying, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana'. He is now dead. How would Sita react to this voice? What would be the condition of Lakshmana? While righteous Rama reflected on this, his hair stood on end. After killing the demon in the figure of a deer and hearing his voice, Rama was overtaken by intense fear born of despair. Then Rama killed another deer, collected the venison and hastened to Janasthana.       Thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the voice in distress and recognising that it was similar to her husband's voice, Sita said to Lakshmana, 'Go and find out Rama's whereabouts'. I clearly heard Rama calling out in great distress. Indeed, my heart as well as my life is not in its place (restless). You ought to go and protect your brother who is crying in pain in the forest. Like a bull caught by lions, your brother is seeking help caught by demons. You should run at once to your brother. When he did not budge in obedience to his brother's order (to protect Sita), the daughter of Janaka in a rage said : Since you, O son of Sumitra,  are not reaching out to your brother in this situation, you are an enemy to your brother in the guise of a friend It is possess me that you wish Rama's death. You do not rush to him certainly because of greed for me. I think Rama's adversity is welcome to you. You do not have any love towards your brother. It is for this that you stand unconcerned instead of proceeding to help your brilliant brother. When he for whose service you have primary come here, has met with difficulty, what is the use of your being here? What purpose you serve by staying here with me ? While Sita thus spoke, flooded with tears of sorrow, frightened like a doe, Lakshmana replied : O Vaidehi there is no doubt that pannagas, asuras, gandharvas, gods, men or even demons cannot defeat him. O brilliant Devi  none  among gods or men, gandharvas, birds or goblins kinnaras, wild animals or dreadful demons can encounter Rama in war. O brilliant Devi  none  among gods or men, gandharvas, birds or goblins kinnaras, wild animals or dreadful demons can encounter Rama in war. Rama is indestructible in war. It is not proper for you to say what you said. When he is not here I do not wish to leave you alone here in the forest. He cannot be stopped by the strength of the mighty, or by Indra supported by gods or by the wellequipped armies of all the three worlds. May your heart be relieved (of this fear)  Give up this grief. Your husband will soon return with the excellent deer killed. Surely it is not his voice. It is contrived by some one's illusory power. It is the illusion created by that demon, like the city of the gandharvas. (which does not exist.) O best of women Vaidehi  great Rama has entrusted your safty to me. I do not wish to leave you here alone. O Vaidehi since the killing of Khara and the residents of Janasthana we have developed enmity with the demons. These demons wander about tormenting others and spreading rumours of all kinds. You need not worry about them. Addressed thus by Lakshmana, Sita got mighty angry. Her eyes turned red and she spoke harshly to truthful Lakshmana O ignoble, cruel Lakshmana, you are a disgrace to your family. I think this great disaster of Rama is a pleasure to you. O Lakshmana,do you speak such words seeing the disaster of Rama?  No wonder that cruel men who always move like you in disguise will thus resort to sinful action against rivals. O Lakshmana,do you speak such words seeing the disaster of Rama?  No wonder that cruel men who always move like you in disguise will thus resort to sinful action against rivals. You are very wicked. You are hiding your true identity, and employed by Bharata, you are following Rama in the forest as he is alone. O Lakshmana such intention of yours or even of Bharata's will not be fulfilled. I have held the hands of Rama who has eyes like the lotus petal, who has the complexion of the blue lotus. How can I prefer some other man? I will undoubtedly give up my life in your presence.I will not live even for a moment on earth without Rama, O son of Sumitra The selfcontrolled Lakshmana with folded palms replied to Sita's harsh, horripilating words: O princess from Mithila, I do not want to use such harsh words. To me you are a deity (worthy of adoration). It is not surprising that women of the world use such undeserving words. It is their nature. O princess from Mithila, I do not want to use such harsh words. To me you are a deity (worthy of adoration). It is not surprising that women of the world use such undeserving words. It is their nature. Women devoid dharma are fickle and inconsistent. They use sharp, piercing words. O daughter of Janaka, O princess from Videha, your words pierce my ears like redhot darts.I cannot tolerate them. I speak what is just while you use harsh and unjust words. Let all beings who move in the forest bear witness. Fie upon you. Like a woman of wicked nature you doubt me when I stood firm by my brother's words. You will go to ruin. O beautiful lady, I will go to Rama wherever he may be. Be happy. O largeeyed one, may  all the deities of the forest protect you. O daughter of Janaka O princess from Videha, I see dreadful omens. I do not know whether I will see you when I am back with Rama. O daughter of Janaka O princess from Videha, I see dreadful omens. I do not know whether I will see you when I am back with Rama. At these words of Lakshmana Sita started crying. With eyes filled with tears she replied with harshness : O Lakshmana without Rama I will drown myself in Godavari or hang myself or leap from a cliff into death. I will drink deadly poison or enter fire and die, but will not touch any other man even with my feet. Thus Sita cried in distress, sadly hitting her belly with both the hands, blaming Lakshmana (all the time). Saumitri saw  the largeeyed, dejected Sita crying in distress.He pacified and consoled her but she did not say anything at all to her husband's brother.",
                "Lakshmana, brother of Rama, hurt by the harsh words of Sita, hastened with Rama's wellbeing in mind. The tenheaded Ravana who was in hiding assumed the guise of a wandering mendicant and approached Sita. And then Ravana wearing fine orange robes, with hair knotted on the head, carrying a parasol, wearing sandals, hanging a kamandalu (waterpot), and a staff on the auspicious left shoulder walked towards Vaidehi like a mendicant. Mighty Ravana approached Sita deprived of both the brothers, Like darkness encompasses the evening twilight in the absence of the Sun and the Moon. The extremely cruel Ravana saw the illustrious young wife of Rama just as Ketu looks at Rohini star in the absence of the Moon. Seeing the ferocious Ravana, the huge trees at Janasthana shook vidently. Even the wind ceased to blow. Seeing Ravana with his bloodred eyes, the swiftflowing river Godavari slowed down out of fear. The tenheaded Ravana who was waiting for Rama's absence now got it. Disguised as a mendicant he stepped toward to where Sita was. The evilminded Ravana in the guise of a holy man, like Saturn moves towards Chitra star, came close to Sita who was brooding over her husband. Just like a well is concealed by an overgrowth of grass, Ravana guised as a holy man stood looking at illustrious Sita, the wife of Rama. The wicked demon came close to that auspicious princess from Videha sitting in the cottage Her face was like the full moon. Her teeth and lips were lovely. She was clad in yellow silk. Her eyes were like lotus petals tormented by tears of grief. The wicked demon came close to that auspicious princess from Videha sitting in the cottage Her face was like the full moon. Her teeth and lips were lovely. She was clad in yellow silk. Her eyes were like lotus petals tormented by tears of grief. Sita was the most lovely lady of the world shining in beauty. She was like the goddess of wealth (Laxmi) without her lotus. Ravana praised her thus: Who are you with a golden complexion, clad in yellow silk, and looking like a lotuspond and wearing an auspicious lotus garland? O lady with a beautiful face, with lovely thighs, are you 'hri', shyness personified? Are you the auspicious lovely Lakshmi, the  goddess of wealth? Are you the goddess of fame? Are you an apsara? Are you Bhuti, the goddess of fortune? Or are you Rati, the goddess of love moving at your free will ? Your teeth are even and pointed, white and beautiful.Your eyes are large and clear and sparkling with dark pupils with a red tinge at the corner. Your big hips are stout and strong, Your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant, your breasts adorned with gems, are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples, shining and delightful, adding beauty. Your big hips are stout and strong, Your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant, your breasts adorned with gems, are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples, shining and delightful, adding beauty. O lady with an elegant smile, beautiful teeth, lovely  eyes you are enticing.Your slender waist can be compassed by my fist.Your hair is beautiful and your large breasts are rubbing against each other.You are capturing my mind  just as the flow of water in a river  touches its banks. O lady with an elegant smile, beautiful teeth, lovely  eyes you are enticing.Your slender waist can be compassed by my fist.Your hair is beautiful and your large breasts are rubbing against each other.You are capturing my mind  just as the flow of water in a river  touches its banks. O beautiful lady I have not seen such a beauty earlier either among goddesses or among gandharavis, or yakshis or even among kinneris. You are the most beautiful among women in the world. With all your tenderness and youth you are living in this forlorn forest. This maddens my heart. It is not safe for a lady like you to reside here. Move out at once. This is only fit for the dwelling of horrible demons who can change their form at will. You deserve to stroll in the terraces of palaces, in beautiful, luxurious and fragrant city gardens. O beautiful, blackeyed lady, I think you deserve the best of garlands, best of food, and clothes and a suitable husband. O best of women O lady with beautiful buttocks  can you be one  of the Rudras or Maruts or Vasus? To me, you appear like a goddess. Neither gandharvas, nor kinnaras, nor gods move here. This is only a dwelling place for the demons. How did you come here ? There are monkeys, lions, panthers, tigers, hyenas, bears, kanka birds and other wild animals here. How is it that you are not afraid of them? O Charming lady how is it that although alone you are not afraid of the dreadful, swift, powerful wild animals like elephants in rut ? Who are you, O auspicious lady ? Who are your people? Why are you here? From where have you come? For what reason are you going about alone in this fierce Dandaka tract, inhabited by demons? Seeing Ravana, a villain in the guise of a brahmin praising her, Sita, the princess of Videha, honoured him with all hospitality. She offered the handsome guest a seat first and then water for washing his feet with, and then invited him for food. Sita, being a lady, was unable to doubt him since he came in the guise of a brahmin, holding a bottlegourd and a begging bowl. Without knowing his illintention she invited him in, mistaking him for a brahmin. O brahmin, here is the seat for you. Feel free to sit. Here is water to wash your feet with. This is the best of food for you collected from the forest. Please partake this without hesitation. Ravana was observing the princess from Mithila, wife of a king inviting him  and speaking to him in cordial manner. Looking at her, he resolved to  abduct her forcibly, inviting his own death. Sita looked out for the beautiful figure of Rama who had gone to hunt the deer along with Lakshmana. Waiting eagerly for her husband, she only saw the vast stretch of green forest  but not Rama and Lakshmana.       Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Ravana in the guise of a mendicant with crooked intention to abduct her, asked Vaidehi to tell him about herself. 'He is a brahmin and also a guest. If unanswered he may curse me'. Thinking this Sita thought for a moment and said: O best of brahmins be pleased to know I am Sita by name, daughter of the great Janaka, king of Mithila and wife of Rama. I lived in the house of the Ikshvakus for twelve years and enjoyed all kinds of pleasures meant for mortals. In the thirteenth year, the king and lord Dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate Rama. Arrangements for consecration were on when queen Kaikeyi sought a boon from the king. For the fulfilment of the promise made to Kaikeyi earlier by my truthful fatherin law, who, to my good luck, was the best of kings, she asked for two boons. One was banishment of my husband and second, consecration of Bharata. 'I shall not eat, or sleep or even drink if Rama is consecrated and I shall put an end to my life itself' (said Kaikeyi). The king, my fatherinlaw, who respected her offered riches. Which she did not accept. My husband who was very bold was twentyfive years and I had completed eighteen years since my birth. My husband known in the world as Rama is largeeyed, longarmed, virtuous, truthful, pure and is always engaged in the welfare of all beings. The brilliant king, Dasaratha, father of Rama, overcome by passion,  did not consecrate Rama in order to please Kaikeyi. When my husband Rama approached his father for the consecration she said these unhesitating words: 'O Rama, listen, your father has ordered that this kingdom be bestowed on Bharata without any obstacles. 'O Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty, you should live in the forest for fourteen years and save your father from falsehood'. My husband Rama, a man of fearlessness and firm resolution, said to Kaikeyi 'Be it so' and carried out her words. O brahmin this is his firm resolve and his great vow: 'One should give and never take one should speak the truth and nothing but he truth.' Son to the second mother of Rama, his mighty halfbrother, by name, Lakshmana, a tiger among men and a  slayer of enemies in battle is a companion to him. Lakshmana, his brother, is righteous and steadfast. Bow in hand, he followed Rama along with me, into exile. Rama who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled entered the Dandaka forest with matted locks, his brother and me. O best of brahmins three of us have been wandering with courage in the deep forest, dislodged from  the kingdom on account of  Kaikeyi. Rest here awhile. My husband will return with plenty of meat of many kinds from the forest, killing deer, alligators and wild boars. Rest here awhile. My husband will return with plenty of meat of many kinds from the forest, killing deer, alligators and wild boars. O brahmin, tell me your name, your gotra and your pedigree. And the purpose for which you are going about all alone in this Dandaka forest To these words of Sita, Rama's wife, Ravana, the powerful king of demons, replied  sharp: O Sita I am called Ravana, the lord of demons by whom all the worlds of demons, snakes and gods are frightened. O flawless beauty of golden complexion seeing you clad in silk, I am not inclined to show any interest in my own wives. You will be the chief queen among the best of women I have won in wars. Be blessed. My great city  called Lanka is on the peak of a mountain surrounded by, and in the middle of, the sea. O Sita, you can stroll with me in my pleasuregardens. O  beautiful lady, you will not like living in the forest (thereafter). O Sita  if you become my wife, five thousand female attendants adorned with all ornaments will attend on you. Thus addressed by Ravana, Janaki, a lady of blemishless limbs, got enraged and replied without caring for the demon: I am devoted to Rama, my husband, who is unshakeable like a huge mountain, is comparable to lord Indra and is imperturbable like the mighty ocean. I am the loyal wife of venerable Rama who is endowed with all excellences, a refuge to all like  a spreading banyan tree, and a votary of truth. I am the faithful wife of the longarmed, broadchested  Rama,  a lion among men. His gait is the gait of an advancing, invincible lion. I am the devoted wife of great Rama, whose face is like a fullmoon, who is the son of a king, who has conquered his senses and whose fame is widespread (on earth). You are a jackal, and you want a lioness like me who is difficult to win. I am like the Sun's radiance whom you cannot even touch. O luckless Ravana  you want the beloved wife of Rama.You will, for sure, see golden trees. (which those close to death do). You are seeking to pull the teeth from  the mouth of a hungry and powerful lion who is considered the enemy of the deer(which you are). You intend to pull the fang of a poisonous snake. You are trying to carry the greatest of mountains, the Mandara, with one hand. You are wishing to go safe after drinking deadly poison (produced from the churning of the ocean). You wish to violate the loving wife of Rama. You are rubbing your eyes with a needle and licking the razor with your tongue. You want to assault Rama's dear wife. It is like girding a stone round the neck and trying to cross the sea.It is like intending to take the Sun and the Moon with both your hands. You intend to assaut the wife of Rama, who is a lady of virtuous conduct. You wish to hold blazing fire in your cloth. You want to acquire Rama's worthy wife. You wish to walk on sharp ironheaded spear. The difference between you and Rama is the difference between a jackal and a lion in the forest, between a ditch and the sea, and between sour gruel and the best of wines. The difference between you and Rama is the difference  between gold and lead, sandal and slime, an elephant and a cat of the forest. The difference between you and Dasaratha's son is the difference between a crow and Garuda, a watercrane and a peacock, a vulture and a swan in the forest. So long Rama, equal in prowess to the thousandeyed Indra stands with bow and arrows in hand, I will not, although abducted, wither away like a diamond gulped by an insect (fly). Having said thus to the wicked nightwalker Ravana, Sita, pure in thought remained  distressed.Her slender body started trembling like a banana plant becomes shaken by a violent wind. Beholding Sita who was trembling, Ravana, powerful like death, started telling about himself, his clan, his strength and his deeds to instil more fear in her.       Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Addressed thus by Sita, Ravana, his anger roused, knitted his eyebrows with a frown on his forehead and replied to her harshly: O paragon of beauty  I am the halfbrother of Kubera, born of his stepmother. I am known as the tenheaded, powerful Ravana. Be blessed Just as people get scared of death, all (creatures) including gandharvas, gods, evil spirits, birds and snakes run away from me. For some reason or other a duel took place between me and king Kubera. With my prowess, I defeated him in the duel. Out of fear for me, Kubera is residing on the mighty mount Kailasa, leaving his own earlier prosperous place of residence. O noble lady  with my valour I gained over from Kubera the aerial chariot 'Pushpaka', which can go wherever one desires and in which I move about in the sky. O Princess from Mithila, seeing my angry face  even gods led by Indra take to their heels in fear. Wherever I am, the Windgod blows with hesitation. So are the Sun and the Moon afraid of me. Afraid of me the Sun duly discharges his duties. Wherever I stay or move about, the leaves of trees do not shake, and the waters in rivers remain still. My city known as Lanka, teeming with terrific demons, is on the other side of the sea. It is  beautiful like the city of Indra's Amaravati. The beautiful city of Lanka  shines with its pale white ramparts and golden interiors. The entrance gates are encrusted with vaidurya (cat'seye). It is crowded with elephants, horses and chariots. It resounds with the music of trumpets. The trees in the delightful pleasuregardens yield fruits in all seasons. O highminded princess, O Sita while living with me, you will not even think of other women. O blessed lady of fine complexion, while enjoying both human and heavenly  pleasures with me there, you will not remember Rama who is a mortal of short lifespan. Considering the eldest son a weakling, king Dasaratha has sent him away to the forest so that he could consecrate his dear son(Bharata). O largeeyed Sita dislodged from the kingdom, Rama has lost his capacity to think. He is doing penance, assuming an ascetic role. What can he do (for you)? I am lord of all the demons. You should not reject me I am here (only because I am) overcome by the arrows of the god of love. O timid lady if you reject me, you will regret like Urvasi who kicked Pururava and regretted later. O lady of fine complexion, Rama is a (mere) mortal. In war he is no match (even) for my finger. It is your good fortune that you have got me here. Take refuge in me. Thus addressed, Sita was enraged and her eyes turned red. She replied in harsh words to the chief of the demons in that solitary place:. Why do you wish to do something inauspicious by calling Lord Kubera who is worshipped by all beings your brother ? O Ravana ,you are cruel and evilminded. You have no control over your senses. (And yet) you are the ruler of your breed. Surely they are going to be destroyed. It may be possible (for some one) to live after abducting Indra's wife, Sachi, but it is not possible for any one to live after kidnapping the wife of Rama. O demon, you may live long after forcibly snatching the most beautiful Sachi, from the hands of Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, but after abusing a woman like me, you will not be released from death even if you drink nectar.       Thus ends the fortyeighty sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the Sita's words, the powerful Ravana struck his palms one over the other and assumed a huge form (original figure). Ravana again said to that princess from Mithila, I suppose you are too insane to disregard my strength and valour. Standing in the sky, I can  lift the earth with my arms.  I can drink the oceans. I can kill even the god of death in a combat. I can obstruct the Sun and shatter the earth with my sharp arrows. O mad woman I am a husband who can fulfil your desires, and can assume any form at my own free will. Look at me. As Ravana exploded in anger, his ambercoloured eyes turned red like the radiance of the flaming fire, and almost as bright as the Sun. Ravana, brother of Kubera, shed the gentle figure of a mendicant and assumed the form of the god of death. Overcome by intense anger, Ravana's eyes reddened. The nightranger, stood armed with bow and arrows and shining with glittering gold ornaments, appeared like a black cloud. Ravana, chief of the demons, shed the mendicant's form and assumed his real self. Clad in red garments, his eyes turned red in anger. Looking like layers of clouds, he stood in front of Sita, a gem among women. Ravana, chief of the demons, shed the mendicant's form and assumed his real self. Clad in red garments, his eyes turned red in anger. Looking like layers of clouds, he stood in front of Sita, a gem among women. Ravana said to the princess from Mithila, whose black hair was shining, who was luminous like the Sun and was clad in the best of clothes and ornaments. O beautiful lady  if you desire a husband who is famous in the three worlds, take refuge in me. I am fit to be your husband. I am your praiseworthy husband. I will not cause any unpleasantness to you at any time. Abandon on your inclination towards, a (mere) mortal. Divert your love to me. I am your praiseworthy husband. I will not cause any unpleasantness to you at any time. Abandon on your inclination towards, a (mere) mortal. Divert your love to me. O stupid woman you think you are very wise. What is there in Rama so that you are attached to him ? He has left the kingdom and his kith and kin due to the words of a woman. He has not accomplished anything (in life). He has a limited life span and now lives in this forest haunted by wild animals. O stupid woman you think you are very wise. What is there in Rama so that you are attached to him ? He has left the kingdom and his kith and kin due to the words of a woman. He has not accomplished anything (in life). He has a limited life span and now lives in this forest haunted by wild animals. Just as Budha (planet Mercury) catches Rohini (a cluster of five stars) in the sky, the evilminded, infatuated Ravana advanced towards the pitiable, pleasing Sita and caught hold of her. Ravana seized with his left hand the lotuseyed Sita by the hair and lifted her by the thighs with his right hand. The sylvan deities fled out of fear on seeing the dreadful appearance of Ravana who had sharp teeth and mighty arms. He looked like a mountain, a veritable god of death. There arrived the great  golden chariot of Ravana, illusive and wonderful, harnessed with donkeys and braying like donkeys. Reproaching the princess from Videha loudly and harshly, Ravana took her on his lap and put her on the chariot. Seized by Ravana, illustrious Sita screamed aloud Alas, Rama. for one who was far away in the forest. Passionate Ravana took hold of Sita who was not willing and was writhing in pain. He seized her  like (an eagle carrying away) a serpent queen and flew up. While Sita was being carried off in the sky by the king of demons,   she screamed a lot in agony and anxiety like a mad woman in a bewildered state: Alas, O longarmed Lakshmana, you who used to entertain your brother do not know that I am being carried away by this ruthless demon. O Rama, you have given up your life, pleasure and treasure for the sake of righteousness. Do you not see me carried off by an unrighteous fellow ? O scorcher of enemies you are the chastiser of the haughty. Why do you not punish such a sinner like Ravana. The effect of arrogant action cannot be seen right away. Just as the crop yields results only after ripening, in the same way it takes time. Time acts as a supporting factor. Time has taken a toll of your senses. This has made you do what you have done. A great calamity is awaiting you in the hands of Rama. It will end your life. Alas, the lawful wife of the glorious and righteous Rama is being abducted now. Let Kaikeyi along with her relations be happy with her desire fulfilled. O karnikar trees in full bloom in Janasthana, tell Rama quickly that Ravana is kidnapping Sita. I salute to Malyavan and  Prasravana mountains. Tell Rama at once that Ravana is carrying away Sita. O river Godavari abounding in swans and cranes, my salutations to you  Tell Rama immediately that Ravana is taking away Sita. I offer my salutations to different deities residing in this forest abounding in trees of many kinds. Tell my husband about me that I am being whisked away. I seek refuge in all those living beings as well as herds of animals and birds in the forest. Tell Rama that his dear wife Sita whom he loves more than his life is abducted helplessly. If he knows that I am abducted by Yama, the god of death, that mighty, longarmed hero will save me even from there by virtue of his valour. When the griefstricken, largeeyed Sita was lamenting piteously, she saw the vulture (Jatayu) seated on a tree. The heavyhipped Sita felt frightened in the grip of Ravana. When she saw Jatayu she screamed, shaken by sorrow: O Jatayu, see me now being carried away by the sinful king of demons in this pitiable condition as though I am an orphan. This nightranger is equipped with weapons. Cruel, strong and evilminded, he has won wars. You cannot stop him. O Jatayu narrate to Rama and Lakshmana the exact facts of my abduction and all the details without any omission.       Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While reposing, Jatayu heard the cry and at once looked up and saw Ravana and Vaidehi. Glorious Jatayu, the best among the birds, looked like the peak of a mountain. His beak was sharp. His words were auspious. He spoke from the top of the tree: O tenheaded Ravana, I am Jatayu, king of vultures. I am mighty. An eternal follower, of dharma, I am an adherent to truth. Rama, Dasaratha's son, is the king of the entire world. He is equal to Indra and Varuna. He is ever engaged in the welfare of the entire world. The lady you want to abduct from here is the famous Sita, the lawful wife of Rama, the lord of the world. How can a king who adheres to righteousness outrage another's wife ? O powerful one, a king's wife in particular should be protected. Refrain yourself from the vile thought of violating other's wives. Wise men do not adopt what is censured by others. Just like one's own, the wise should protect other's wives. O son of Paulastya learned men determine the path of dharma artha and kama,  following a king's conduct even if  they are not declared in sastras. A king is the best repository of rigteousness, material wealth and pleasures. The king is the root of dharma, virtue and sin. O best of demons  by nature you are sinful, and fickleminded. You do all forbidden acts. Otherwise,how could you get this wealth, like the celestial chariot? Indeed, it is not possible to erase the nature of any one, whatever it be. Prosperity does not rest for long in the house of the evilminded. Powerful and righteous Rama has not offended you, your kingdom or your city. Why do you offend him? On account of Surpanakha, Khara trespassed into Janasthana and got killed by Rama, without much effort. Tell me truly, what transgression (of dharma) did he commit for which you are stealing away the wife of Rama who is the lord of this world?. On account of Surpanakha, Khara trespassed into Janasthana and got killed by Rama, without much effort. Tell me truly, what transgression (of dharma) did he commit for which you are stealing away the wife of Rama who is the lord of this world?. Leave Vaidehi at once lest with her fierce looks you should be burnt down like demon Vrtra by the thunderbolt of Indra. You are not aware that you are tying a venomous snake with the skirt of your cloth. worn by you. You are not able to see the noose of death tightened around your neck. O gentle Ravana one should carry that much of weight which does not tire him. One should eat only that wholesome food which can be easily digested. Who will do such a deed which cannot beget dharma, fame or glory in the world? Who will do such deeds that bring only exhaustion to the body? Sixty thousand years ago I was born, O Ravana  Since then I have ruled justly my hereditary kingdom. I am old, you are young, wielding a bow and arrows, with shield to protect and chariot to ride. Even then I will not let you go safe with Vaidehi kidnapped. You cannot carry Vaidehi by force within my very sight just as the everlasting revelations of the Vedas cannot be robbed by mere logic of reason. O Ravana, if you are brave, fight with me. In a moment, you will be killed like Khara and lie down on the ground. Clad in bark garments, Rama, who has often slain demons in the past will soon kill you in war. What can I do? O mean fellow the two princes have gone far away.You will soon be destroyed out of fear for them. There is no doubt. I will not let you take away the auspicious, lotuseyed Sita, the dear consort of Rama as long as I am alive. I should do this important work of those great souls, Rama and Dasaratha, even if it claims my life. O ten headed Ravana stay, stay for a while. O demon  as long as I am alive I will treat you with the hospitality of war. You will be pulled down from this best of the chariots like a ripe fruit drops from the stalk.       Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Ravana's twenty eyes glowed like fire in anger after Jatayu thus rightly said. As the bright gold earrings of the intolerant king of demons glittered, his eyes turned red in rage and he pounced upon Jatayu, the lord of birds. The clash between them was tumultuous and it appeared like the clash of two pieces of clouds in the sky raised by stormy winds. The duel between Ravana and Jatayu looked as though it was a fight between two huge winged mountains of Malyavan range. Then the mighty Ravana rained sharp, dreadful shafts, spears and Vikarnis at Jatayu,  king of vultures. Jatayu, lord of the birds, faced the arrows and other weapons showered  by Ravana. The mighty, virtuous vulture with his sharp claws wounded many parts of the body of Ravana. Ravana in a rage took ten dreadful darts (looking) like the staff of death with a desire to crush the enemy. The mighty Ravana fully released his dreadful, sharp arrows that went straight and pierced the vulture. Seeing Sita, daughter of Janaka, on the demon's chariot with eyes full of tears, Jatayu without minding the arrows renewed his attack. The glorious lord of birds crushed with his feet the bow and arrow of Ravana with pearls and gems encrusted. Overcome with anger, Ravana took another bow and rained (on him) hundreds and thousands of arrows. Jatayu, shot with arrows on all sides in the combat, shone like the bird that returned to its nest. Powerful Jatayu scattered the shower of arrows with his wings and broke down the great bow with his claws. Mighty Jatayu, lord of the birds, shattered with his wings the armour of Ravana that was glowing like fire. Powerful Jatayu killed in the combat, the splendid, swiftmoving, devilfaced asses with  golden shields yoked to the chariot. Then he(Jatayu) broke down the great chariot(of Ravana) glowing like fire, glittering with gold and gems, made of three bamboo reeds, and capable of flying wherever the rider willed. Jatayu violently pulled down the parasol shining like the full moon and the fans of the chariot along with the demons holding them. Again the glorious, powerful king of birds swiftly shattered the huge head of the charioteer with his beak. With the bow broken, the chariot destroyed, asses (drawing the chariot) and the charioteer dead,  Ravana fell down on the ground holding Vaidehi on his lap. Seeing Ravana fallen on the ground with his broken chariot, all beings honoured the king of the birds, saying, Well done Well done Seeing the lord of the flocks of birds exhausted due to age still fighting, Ravana felt glad. He flew back into the sky taking Sita, princess of Mithila, with him. Seeing Sita, Janaka's daughter, happily carried away into the sky by Ravana on his lap. Jatayu, the mighty king of vultures chased him, and obstructing his path said : Foolish Ravana, you are kidnapping this lady, wife of Rama, whose arrows can hit like a thunderbolt. This will lead to the destruction of all demons. You are drinking poison along with all your friends, relatives, ministers, the army and  your allies. like a thirsty man drinks water. Fools who do not know the consequences of their action perish soon. Similarly you are going to die soon. You are bound by the noose of death like a fish holding on to the bait of the fishing hook. Where can you go now? O Ravana  know that Rama and Lakshmana, the Kakutsthas, are invincible. They will not forgive the asssault you have made on their hermitage. Your cowardly action will be condemned by the whole world. The path you have chosen is the path of a thief and not of a hero. O Ravana if you are courageous, tarry awhile and fight with me. Like your brother Khara, you will lie on the ground dead. You have resorted to unrighteous action like a dying man. This will spell your destruction. If the consequences of an action be sin, who will do it ? Even the selfborn lord of the world may not. Brave Jatayu having thus said these cautious words to the demon dashed against his back again and again. Thereafter, seizing Ravana, Jatayu ascended on his back and pierced his body all over with his sharp claws just as a rider goads an unruly elephant. Jatayu who had  his claws, wings and beak as the only weapons  pierced and pricked  Ravana all over with his nails by pressing his beak on his back and pulled out his hair. Thus tormented again and again by the king of vultures, Ravana shook with anger, his lips quivering. Losing his senses, with rage, Ravana held Vaidehi (Sita) with his left arm and hit Jatayu with his palm. Then Jatayu, lord of the birds, subduer of enemies, overpowered Ravana and dismembered his ten left arms with his beak. As the left arms were cut off, there came out from them all the ten arms instantaneously like serpents emitting poisonous flames from anthills Then the tenheaded Ravana left Sita and attacked Jatayu with his fists and feet out of anger. Between the warriors of unequal valour, Ravana and Jatayu, the chief of the demons and the foremost of the birds, the fight took place for a moment. Ravana lifted his sword and cut off both the wings and feet of Jatayu who was fighting relentlessly (for Rama's sake). (Seriously) wounded and almost dead,the vulture fell down on the ground all at once, when his wings were chipped by the demon of terrible deeds. Sita, princess of Videha, saw the wounded Jatayu fallen on the ground drenched in blood. Grieving, she ran towards him as if he was her relative. Lord of Lanka saw that very bold Jatayu of dark blue colour of the cloud, fair chest, fallen on the ground, looking like the forest fire that had been put out. Sita, daughter of Janaka, whose face was radiant like the Moon once again embraced  Jatayu, the winged warrior, fallen on the ground, crushed by Ravana's onslaught and wept.       Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita,whose face was like the lord of the stars (Moon), saw Jatayu, king of birds, struck down by Ravana, and lamented in extreme grif : People, for sure, foresee weal and woe in life from auspicious symptoms and ominous sounds. O Rama you are, indeed, unaware of the great disaster that has befallen you. All the animals and birds are running for my sake to tell you about me, O scion  of the Kakutsthas. 'This bird that came forward to save me is hit by the sinner(Ravana) and lies down on the ground, as ill luck would have it. Terribly frightened, the beautiful lady (Sita) cried bitterly, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana, save me', as if they were close by and were listening to her. Ravana, king of the demons, ran towards Sita who was weeping like an orphan with her garlands and ornaments crushed. Separated from Rama in the forest, Sita hugged huge trees, running round and round like a creeper coiled, crying loudly, 'Rama, O Rama' . The king of the demons, like Yama, caught hold of her hair only to invite his death, all the time saying, Leave it, Leave it  (Leave the tree). Separated from Rama in the forest, Sita hugged huge trees, running round and round like a creeper coiled, crying loudly, 'Rama, O Rama' . The king of the demons, like Yama, caught hold of her hair only to invite his death, all the time saying, Leave it, Leave it  (Leave the tree). While Sita was being assaulted, the earth with the animate and the inanimate crossed all limits of moral law and became enveloped in blinding darkness. The wind  ceased to blow and the Sun, to shine. Brahma, the glorious Grandfather, saw with his divine eyes, Sita in a desperate state caught by the enemy and said, 'The task is accomplished. All the great seers residing in Dandaka forest felt both happy and sad, happy because the destruction of Ravana is at hand and sad because Sita was in distress. All the great seers residing in Dandaka forest felt both happy and sad, happy because the destruction of Ravana is at hand and sad because Sita was in distress. While Sita was crying, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana', Ravana, lord of the demons, carried her back into the sky. SIta who had put on pure gold ornaments on her body and who was clad in yellow silk  shone like lightning. Ravana was shining all the more with(her) yellow clothes blowing in the air, and looked like a mountain shining with fire burning around. The red lotus petals worn by the most auspicious Sita, princess of Videha, were showered on Ravana. As the goldencoloured garment worn by Sita blew in the wind, it looked like a coppercoloured cloud illumined by the evening Sun in the sky. Sita's face with her beautiful nose on Ravana's lap and not on Rama's, shone no more like a lotus without its stalk. Sita's face looked beautiful with her smooth forehead, shining hair and spotless complexion like the inside of a lotus, with clean, white, shining teeth, a nice nose and lovely red lips. She was continuously weeping and wiping her tears. Her face which was pleasing like the Moon on the lap of Ravana appeared as though the Moon was rising through dark clouds.

Sita's face looked beautiful with her smooth forehead, shining hair and spotless complexion like the inside of a lotus, with clean, white, shining teeth, a nice nose and lovely red lips. She was continuously weeping and wiping her tears. Her face which was pleasing like the Moon on the lap of Ravana appeared as though the Moon was rising through dark clouds. Shaken up by the demon and deprived of Rama's company, Sita's beautiful face looked like the Moon during daytime without any glow. Goldencomplexioned Sita, princess of Mithila, held by the darkcoloured king of the demons, shone like a girdle resting on a dark blue sapphire. Bright like a golden lotus, adorned with gold ornaments, Sita, the daughter of Janaka, held by Ravana, looked like a streak of lightning shining bright in a dark cloud. The lord of the demons by the side of Sita, princess of Videha with her jingling ornaments looked like the darkblue raincloud with its lightning and thunder. As Sita was being carried away, the shower of flowers dropped from her head and scattered on the earth. The shower of flowers that fell flew towards the tenheaded Ravana again in the swirling motion (of the chariot). The shower of flowers that dropped went round towards Ravana, brother of Vaisravana, like the bright garland of stars move towards mount Meru. The gemstudded anklet of Sita, looking like an orb of lightning, dropped with a gentle sound. With her golden girdle, Sita whose complexion resembled tender leaves looked like a golden chain to bind an elephant with. (Here Ravana is the elephant). The younger brother of Vaisravana (Ravana), like a massive comet, carried Sita, who was glowing in the radiance of her own beauty, and entered the sky. Like the dim stars falling from the sky, her ornaments, bright as flame, scattered on the groundtinkling. Sita's necklace shining like the bright Moon slipped from between her breasts like the river Ganga falling down from the sky. The trees filled with birds of all kinds, shaken at the top by stormy winds seemed to be saying to Sita, 'Be not afraid'. Lotusponds with withering lotuses and with disturbed aquatic life like fishes in fright were as if grieving for Sita as one would grieve for a companion who is unable to breathe. Then the lions, tigers, deer and birds gathered together in anger (also anguish) and ran after Sita's shadow. The  mountains were  shedding tears in the form of waterfalls, and  crying with hands lifted up in the form of peaks, while Sita was being carried away. Seeing Sita abducted, the glorious Sun looked lustreless and distraught. He developed a pale white disk around him. When Rama's consort, the princess of Videha, is being carried away by Ravana, how can there be rightousness or truth or uprightness or compassion for men? Thus bewailed all beings in groups. The young deer full of fear and distress looked again and again with eyes blurred with tears at the direction in which Sita went. And wept. The  sylvan deities shivered, seeing Sita's grief and cried aloud. The ten headed Ravana abducted Sita who was calling out, O Rama, O Lakshmana with her sweet voice, weeping , looking down on the earth her hair dishevelled and auspicious, (vermilion) mark on the forehead erased. Ravana abducted this highminded Sita for his own destruction.

Ravana abducted this highminded Sita for his own destruction. Then Sita  whose teeth were  beautiful and smile, sweet was distanced from her kins, and, unable to see both Rama and Lakshmana, grew pale in intense fear.       Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita, daughter of Janaka, princess of Mithila felt miserable, looking at Ravana taking off and got very  much agitated out of fear. While being carried away, Sita wept piteously and her eyes went red with tears of anger and grief. Looking at the frightening eyes of the king of the demons, she said these words : O mean Ravana, are you not ashamed of kidnapping me when I was separated (from my husband)? O wicked fellow, with an intention to abduct me you enticed my husband to a distance deceitfully in the form of a deer. This Jatayu, an old friend of my fatherinlaw tried to protect me but he too has fallen a prey. O lowly demon, you have, indeed, shown your heroism  (in killing this old vulture). You have not won me in a battle declared by you. O lowly fellow how is it that you are not ashamed of commiting such a despicable act  abducting another's wife when she is alone ? You consider yourself to be brave after committing such a cruel, despicable and unrighteous act for which people of the world will condemn you. Fie upon your heroism and strength about which you boasted. Fie upon your character that would bring calumny to the race and the world. I condemn such behaviour of yours. Tarry a little, you will not go back with life. What can be done now since you are running away so swiftly? If you come within sight of these two princes, it will not be possible for you to live for a moment even if you are with your entire army. Just as a bird cannot bear the touch of forest fire, you will not be able to endure the mere touch of arrows of the two heroes indeed. O Ravana be good and do whatever is beneficial to you. It is proper for you to release me. If you do not, enraged over my assault, my husband along with his brother, will bring about your destruction. O vile creature, the effort you are making to abduct me forcibly will be fruitless. I will not be eager to hold on to my life for long to live at the mercy of the enemy without being able to see my godlike husband. At the time of death, mortals behave very differently. They act contrary to their own welfare. Likewise you are not able to foresee what is beneficial and good for you. Those who wish to die, do not like anything salutary. I see the noose of death wound round your neck now. O tenheaded Ravana, since you do not fear the source of fear, evidently you see golden trees. (a symptom of death). O Ravana, you see the dreadful river Vaitarani with torrents of blood flowing and frightening forest of trees with swords as leaves. You will see a log of salmali tree with bright golden flowers and excellent vaidurya stone with pointed iron thorns. You are pitiless. You will not be able to survive for long after deceiving such noble Rama just as man cannot survive after drinking poison. O Ravana you are bound by the inevitable noose of death. Where shall you get away from great Rama, my husband to obtain peace. Rama has killed fourteen thousand demons alone without his brother within a moment. He is a strong warrior and wellversed in the use of all kinds of weapons. You have stolen his loving wife. How can he live without killing you. Rama has killed fourteen thousand demons alone without his brother within a moment. He is a strong warrior and wellversed in the use of all kinds of weapons. You have stolen his loving wife. How can he live without killing you. Sita, daughter of Videha, full of sorrow and fear under Ravana's grip uttered these partly harsh and partly piteous wordsweeping. Sinful Ravana carried away the beautiful princess trembling with great fear, struggling helplessly, crying pathetically and pleading in many mournful ways.       Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Sita was being kidnapped, she saw no one to protect her. Only five great monkeys stood on the top of a mountain. Largeeyed, bright and beautiful Sita dropped her upper silk garment shining like gold and auspicious ornaments in their midst with a hope they may report this  to Rama. In his excitement Ravana failed to notice when Sita dropped down that garment along with ornaments in their midst. The best among the tawneyeyed monkeys gazed, without blinking, at the  largeeyed Sita lamenting. Ravana crossed the lake Pampa and flew towards the city of Lanka carrying with him lamenting daughter of Videha. Delighted Ravana, carried off Sita, the very embodiment of his death, like one carrying a highly poisonous sharpfanged female snake on his lap. Like an arrow released from the bow, Ravana went through the sky, at once crossing forests, rivers mountains and tanks. Ravana soon crossed the refuge of rivers, the abode of Varuna, god of the sea, inexhaustible ocean, and the home for whales and crocodiles. While Sita, princess of Videha was being carried away, the ocean, abode of Varuna got bewildered, waves rolled back, the movement of big serpents and fishes stopped. The charanas and siddhas moving in the sky said, O tenheaded Ravana this is your  end . Ravana entered the city of Lanka holding Sita who was tossing from side to side and who was the very embodiment of his death. Ravana went through the well laidout roads of the city of Lanka and through the well many guarded halls of the palace and entered the inner apartment. Sita, with her dark eye lashes and lost in utter sorrow was kept in the harem by Ravana, like demon Maya kept Mayamayi. Ravana ordered the female goblins of fearful appearance,'Let no outsider whether man or woman, see her, without my permission'. Pearls, gems or gold, clothes or ornaments, whatever she desires, be made available to her without any hesitation. Whoever utters any unpleasant words knowingly or unknowingly to Sita, princess of Videha is not worthy to survive (must be killed). The courageous lord of the demons, having said so to the demonesses, came out of the inner apartment. While contemplating the future course of action, he saw eight powerful, carnivorous demons. The courageous lord of the demons, having said so to the demonesses, came out of the inner apartment. While contemplating the future course of action, he saw eight powerful, carnivorous demons. The mighty Ravana, deluded by the boons, praised the strength and valour of the demons and said : Armed with different weapons, proceed at once to Janasthana where Khara lived and died. Go and there in the desolate Janasthana where all demons had been killed, leaving all your apprehensions and relying on your strength and vigour. I had stationed a great army at Janasthana, who were all killed along with Khara and Dusana by Rama's arrows. My anger engineered by my intolerance has crossed the limits of my patience. It has created in me a terrific enmity against Rama. I want to take revenge on my foe. I shall not sleep until I kill him in a combat. I will be happy only after killing the destroyer of Khara and Dusana, just as a poor man feels happy only on acquiring wealth. While dwelling at Janasthana, all of you should collect exact information about the activities of Rama. All of you, O nightrangers, should be on the alert there and it should be always your duty to try to kill Rama. I have seen your strength on many war fronts. That is why you have been assigned this  duty at Janasthana. The eight demons were glad to hear the pleasing and meaningful words of Ravana. They offered him salutations and left Lanka in the direction of Janasthana without being seen by any one. Then the demon Ravana felt greatly happy for getting Sita, princess of Mithila, without knowing in his delusion that he had created the bitterest enmity with Rama.       Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After ordering the eight most fierce  and powerful demons, Ravana had a sense of accomplishment within himself because of his perverse intellect. Thinking about Vaidehi and hit by the arrows of Cupid (the god of love). Ravana hastened to see Sita and entered the beautiful home. Ravana, lord of the demons, entered his residence and saw Sita full of grief in the midst of the demonesses. The demon Ravana forcibly took Sita, her face full of tears, to show her his heavenlike home. Inflicted with grief she looked wretched. She resembled a female deer hounded out of the herd. With her head bent in grief, she looked pathetic like one not under her control, like a boat sinking under the sea driven by the wind.

He ascended the wonderful golden staircase taking Sita along with him.Beautiful looked the rows of mansions with silver and ivory windows and golden trellis. The tenheaded Ravana showed Sita, the princess from Mithila the floors with wonderful crystals. Ravana showed Sita who was overwhelmed with sorrow, stepwells surrrounded by various trees and tanks. The sinful Ravana showed Sita, princess of Videha, the best of all his mansions in order to allure her, saying: O Sita, leaving aside children and the aged, I am the lord of crores of nightrangers in addition to ten crore demons and twentytwo crore terrorists. For me alone there are a thousand attendants.The  administration of the kingdom and all my subjects will be under your control. O largeeyed Sita you are dearer to me than my life. For me alone there are a thousand attendants.The  administration of the kingdom and all my subjects will be under your control. O largeeyed Sita you are dearer to me than my life. O Sita dear  be my chief queen among the many thousands of women I have married. Do not think otherwise. Be good and accept my request. I am consumed by thoughts of you. You should be gracious to me. This Lanka extending to a hundred yojanas and surrounded by the sea is vulnerable to neither demons nor gods including Indra. I do not see any one equal to me in valour among gods, or yakshas or gandharvas or birds. Of what use is Rama who has lost his kingdom, who is depressed and leads an ascetic life and who is a shortlived, lacklustre human being. O Sita take refuge only in me. I am a befitting husband to you. O timid one youth is impermanent. Enjoy (your life) with me while it lasts. O lovely Sita, give up the thought of seeing Rama. Where does he possess the power to reach this place even on the mental plane ? It is not possible to bind  the wind blowing at high speed in the sky. Similarly it is not possible to catch the brilliant glow of flaming fire. O lovely lady, I do not see any one in these three worlds who can, by his valour, take you away from me guarded by my arms. Rule this vast kingdom of Lanka. People like me, even gods and all beings, mobile and immobile, will be at your beck and call. Drenched with the waters of consecration, entertain me. The effect of the bad deeds done in the past are over with your dwelling in the forest. Now enjoy the fruits  of your good and righteous deeds here with me. O princess from Mithila, put on all garlands of wonderful fragrance and finest of jewels here with me. O finehipped lady, I won by my strength from my brother Vaisravana (Kubera) an aerial chariot called Pushpaka shining with the radiance of the Sun. O Sita that excellent chariot is big and beautiful. Where on you can roam happily along with me. O heavyhipped lady your face which is a clean lotus pleasing to the eye has lost its shine, stricken with grief. As Ravana went on speaking thus, Sita covered her beautiful, moonlike face with the edge of her garment and stood shedding tears. While Sita was lost in thought, feeling ill at lase, looking wretched with her beauty dulled by her anxiety, the sinful lord of the demons continued : O Sita you need not feel shamed that it is a violation of righteous conduct. Take it as godsend which has the approval of sages. I am bowing down, pressing my heads at your shining feet. I am at your mercy. Grant me your favourI will remain your slave and remain ever under your control. My throat has dried up. I have spoken these words in a forlorn state. Ravana has never bowed down to a woman in obeisance. Having said this to the daughter of Janaka, the tenheaded Ravana who had fallen under the control of Yama, lord of death, misconceived that she had become his own.       Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus addressed by Ravana, Sita, immersed in deep sorrow and unafraid of him, placed  a blade of grass between her and him (intending not to speak to him  straight) and replied: Rama is a son of  the renowned king Dasaratha, who was a firm ambankment (protector) of righteousness and was true to his promise. The longarmed, largeeyed Rama is famous in all the three worlds. He is my husband, a righteous soul and a god to all. The brilliant Rama of the Ikshvaku dynasty with the lion's shoulders will come with his brother Lakshmana and take away your life. Had you abducted me forcibly in his presence, you would have been lying down dead just as Khara in Janasthana. Those dreadful, mighty demons you have described are ineffective in his presence just like the serpents who with their venom are ineffective  in the presence of  Suparna (Garuda). The goldtipped arrows released from his bowstring will shatter your body like the waves erode the banks of river Ganga. O Ravana, even if you stand invulnerable to gods and demons, you will not come out alive in the combat with Rama with whom you have earned great enmity. Powerful Rama will put an end to whatever little life you are left with. Just as a beast tied to a sacrificial post, you will not  survive. O demon, you will be completely consumed if Rama looks at you with eyes burning in anger. He who can bring down the Moon to the earth from the sky or even dash it down, he who can drain the sea dry will definitely release me from here. Your life is coming to an end. Your fortunes will wane, your strength will be sapped. Your senses will be dissipated. By your deeds Lanka will attain widowhood. This evil deed(of abduction) will not yield happy results.You have brought me from my husband from the forest without any forethought. My effulgent, valiant husband armed with divine power resides fearlessly in the desolate Dandaka. He will remove your pride, your power, your valour and haughtiness from your limbs with a shower of arrows in the fight. When destruction draws near, people being prompted by time start commiting blunders in their deeds. You vilest of demons, since you have assaulted me, the time of your death and destruction of all demons and of all women in the harem has drawn near. The sacrificial altar adorned with ladles and vessels and sanctified by the sacred mantras recited by brahmins cannot be defiled by a chandala (man of lowest caste). O lowly demon  similarly I am a chaste woman and wife of the ever righteous Rama who cannot be defiled by a sinner like you. How can a female swan ever sporting in lotusponds in the company of a royal swan look at the watercrow resting on a grassy land? O demon  this body has (now) no consciousness. You may bind it or bury it. I do not think that this body or even this life need to be protected. But at no cost can I make this an object of censure on earth (must not be branded an unchaste woman). Having uttered these very harsh words out of anger, the daughter of Videha, the princess from Mithila spoke no more. Having heard such harsh, horripilating words from Sita, Ravana replied in a way designed to create fear in her: O comely princess from Mithila, O lady with a sweet smile listen to my words. If you do not accept my hand in the course of twelve months, the cooks will cut you off into small bits for the (my) breakfast. O comely princess from Mithila, O lady with a sweet smile listen to my words. If you do not accept my hand in the course of twelve months, the cooks will cut you off into small bits for the (my) breakfast. Enraged Ravana, who used to make enemies wail, turned to the demonesses and said these words. Addressing the flesheating, blooddrinking, loathsome and fearful demonesses Ravana said, Humble her pride at once. No sooner had Ravana said it than the dreadful demonesses offered obeisance to him with folded hands and surrounded Sita. Stamping his feet and shaking the ground as if tearing the earth, Ravana said to those fiercelooking demonesses: Let this Sita be led into the Asoka grove. There sit round her and protect her in secret (her presence there should not be made public). There you all bring her under control through forcing and cajoling as one would do to tame a wild sheelephant. Thus instructed by Ravana, the demonesses took Sita into the Asoka grove, which was full of perenmal fruits and flowers of different kinds, where trees yielded fruits of all seasons and birds were always cheerful. Thus instructed by Ravana, the demonesses took Sita into the Asoka grove, which was full of perenmal fruits and flowers of different kinds, where trees yielded fruits of all seasons and birds were always cheerful. Sita, daughter of Janaka, engulfed in grief found herself like a doe under the control of tigresses. Sita, daughter of Janaka, immersed in deep grief knew no peace just like a doe caught in a snare. Sita had no peace as she was threatened excessively by those women of deformed  looks. Remembering her beloved husband who was also her god, and overtaken by fear and grief , she fell unconscious.

                "Rama killed Maricha, the demon assuming the form of the deer as per his will and swiftly took the return path. While Rama was hasting to see Sita, he heard from behind the ghastly howl of a jackal. Rama knew it was the horrible, horripilating cry of a jackal which made him apprehensive . It made him think. 'The way the jackal is howling appears ominous. May Sita be safe without being eaten up by demons 'If  Lakshmana listens to Maricha imitating my voice in the form of a deer, he, sent by Sita will come for me at once, leaving her behind. 'If  Lakshmana listens to Maricha imitating my voice in the form of a deer, he, sent by Sita will come for me at once, leaving her behind. 'Hence the murder of Sita must have been jointly planned by the demons. Maricha who had assumed the form of a golden deer, took me away from the hermitage to a faroff place where, killed by my arrows, he turned a demon uttering the words, Alas, Lakshmana, I am killed. 'Hence the murder of Sita must have been jointly planned by the demons. Maricha who had assumed the form of a golden deer, took me away from the hermitage to a faroff place where, killed by my arrows, he turned a demon uttering the words, Alas, Lakshmana, I am killed. 'On account of living in this dense forest in Janasthana I have earned enmity with the demons. Will Lakshmana and Sita be safe without my protection? I see many terrible portents.' On hearing the jackal's howl, Rama began thinking how the demon in the form of a deer drew him away. Thus in the midst of apprehensions he reached Janasthana. On hearing the jackal's howl, Rama began thinking how the demon in the form of a deer drew him away. Thus in the midst of apprehensions he reached Janasthana. Dejected at heart, the birds and animals piteously kept the great soul (Rama) to the left and produced a dreadful cacophony. On seeing such dreadfu omens at that time, Rama hurried back to his hermitage. Rama arrived at Janasthana thinking (of the safety) of charming Sita and mighty Lakshmana. He then saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a cheerless face. When the sad, depressed Lakshmana came near, he saw Rama (equally) despondent and griefstricken. In this situation Rama the elder brother rebuked Lakshmana for having left Sita behind in a desolate forest infested with demons. Rama, the delight of the Raghus, took hold of Lakshmana's left hand, and in sadness said these sweet harsh words : O gentle Lakshmana you are to blame for coming here, leaving Sita behind. Alas will she be safe now? O heroic Lakshmana I see many inauspicious omens. I think Sita might have been lost or eaten away by the demons of the forest. There is no doubt about it. O heroic Lakshmana I see many inauspicious omens. I think Sita might have been lost or eaten away by the demons of the forest. There is no doubt about it. O Lakshmana, a tiger among men, will we be able to see the daughter of Janaka, living in a state of total wellbeing? Will we be able to get her back ? O  mighty Lakshmana  from the way the beasts, jackals and birds too have turned in the bright direction of the Sun, crying in a frightful manner, can we hope princess Sita is safe ? Appearing in the guise of a deer, this demon allured me to a great distance. With much effort he was somehow killed. but he assumed his demoniac form while dying. With my heart dejected and depressed, my left eye throbbing, O Lakshmana, I have no doubt that Sita is either abducted or dead or abandoned on the way.       Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, son of Dasaratha, the righteous self, saw Lakshmana downcast and dejected. Seeing him  without Sita, Rama enquired: Where is that princess from Videha who accompanied me when I entered Dandaka forest ? Why have you come here leaving her behind ? Where is that princess from Videha, a sharer of my sorrows, Sita of slender waist who followed this hapless prince disloged from the kingdom into the Dandaka forest? O warrior Lakshmana where is that Sita without whom I have no interest to live for a moment, who was like the daughter of a god and a sustainer of my life? O Lakshmana I desire no lordship of the gods  or of the entire earth without that daughter of Janaka, that lady of golden complexion. O gentle Lakshmana I wonder if Vaidehi, who is dearer to me than my life is still alive I hope my banishment from the kingdom is not going to prove false. O Saumitri when I am dead on account of Sita, and you are back, Kaikeyi with her desire fulfilled will be happy, indeed. O handsome one  I wonder if that lady of renunciation, Kausalya with her son dead, will have to serve Kaikeyi whose desire would be fulfilled, and who will enjoy the power of the throne in the company of her son O Lakshmana, only if Vaidehi is alive will I enter the cottage again or else I will give up my life if that virtuous lady is no more. I will die if Sita, princess from Videha, is not there to speak to me with her sweet smile when I return to the cottage, O Lakshmana Tell me, O Lakshmana   if Sita is alive or not, whether she was eaten up by demons when you were off your guard. Vaidehi is delicate, young and she has never faced any sorrow.She will be certainly disheartened due to separation from me. The evilminded, wicked demon calling out loudly 'O Lakshmana' must have by all means instilled fear in your mind. I am afraid, Vaidehi, frightened by hearing the voice which was like mine sent you to see me, and you came all at once. You have definitely done a great mistake by leaving Sita alone in the forest. This has given a chance to the cruel demons to wreak revenge. The dreadful, carnivorous demons aggrieved over my murder of Khara must have undoubtedly killed Sita. O destroyer of enemies  I am completely drowned in sorrow. What can I do at this moment. Alas, I am destined to suffer. While thus brooding over the beautiful Sita, the scion of the Raghus along with Lakshmana hurried towards Janasthana. Thus blaming his dejected brother, the valiant Rama entered the hermitage, sighing deeply, his face pale and his throat dried up with hunger, exhaustion and thirst. Reaching his dwellingplace, he found it empty. He thoroughly searched the hermitage and the places where she used to move about on the premises. And 'so it has happened', he sadly said to himself, his hair raised on end.       Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, the delight of the Raghus, once again questioned Lakshmana who had come out of the hermitage, deeply hurt: Why did you come, leaving the princess from Mithila alone in the forest when I had left her under your trust ? When I saw you, O Lakshmana, coming without Sita, my mind was oppressed with evil thought which have come true. O Lakshmana, as I saw you from a distance without Sita, my left eye, my shoulder and my heart throbbed. Thus addressed, virtuous Lakshmana, overwhelmed with sorrow replied to the grief stricken Rama: I did not leave her on my own nor have I  come here of my own accord. I came to you, provoked by her angry  words. Uttered loudly, 'Alas Sita, Alas, Lakshmana, save me', as if these were the words of your noble self, reached Sita's ears. The princess from Mithila heard this cry of pain and, wild with fear, urged me out of her love for you to go. When I was repeated asked to go, I said this in order to instil confidence in the princess from Mithila : 'No one  can cause fear in Rama. I do not see any demon who can hold a threat to him. Give up fear. Some one might have said it. 'How can Rama who is capable of saving even gods speak such unworthy, demeaning words, 'Save me, O Sita' O fair lady, for some reason some demon  has uttered these words 'Save me, save me' adapting my brother's voice. 'Lakshmana, save me' are the words uttered in an altered tone. Like an ordinary, lowborn woman you are not to feel concerned for this. 'You should not feel agitated or dispirited. Be composed. There is no one either born or going to be born in the three worlds who can defeat Rama in war. He cannot be conquered in a battle even by gods led by indra.' 'You should not feel agitated or dispirited. Be composed. There is no one either born or going to be born in the three worlds who can defeat Rama in war. He cannot be conquered in a battle even by gods led by indra.' Deluded by her senses, Vaidehi said these words, shedding tears when I  tried to console  her: 'You have an extremely sinful intention of getting me  when your brother is dead. But you will not be able to gain me. 'Since you are not reaching out to Rama who is helplessly crying for his rescue, you must have followed Rama, instructed by Bharata (to do him harm)' 'You are an enemy moving in disguise with an interest in me. You are waiting for an opportunity to set aside Rama. That is why you are not rushing to him.' At these words from the princess of Videha, I came out of the hermitage in an agitated mood with my eyes turned red and lips quivering in anger. To Lakshmana thus reporting, Rama, overcome with grief, said,(Even then) O noble brother your coming here, leaving her behind, is a wrong step taken. You have come out of the hermitage provoked by Maithili's angry words, even though you are aware that I am capable of warding off the demons. I am not happy with you as you have come here deserting Sita on the plea that she was angry and spoke harsh words. Provoked by the words of Sita spoken in anger you came without respecting my orders. It is definitely an act of disobedience. This demon who misled me in the guise of a deer and took me away from the hermitage, lies dead, killed by my arrow. Bending the bow I fixed the arrow and released it at ease. Hit by that arrow he gave up his guise of the deer and assuming the form of a demon with a bracelet on his arm fell down groaning. Hit by the arrow, the demon imitating my voice cried out in desperation which could be clearly audible even from a distance. On hearing the dreadful words you deserted Sita and came here.       Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "As  Rama was returning( to the hermitage), his left eye throbbed repeatedly  and he stumbled and his body trembled. As inauspicious omens appeared again and again, doubting if all is well with Sita, he said to himself, Can Sita be safe? Anxious to see Sita, he hastened to the hermitage and finding it empty, became restless. Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, hurtled in, turning round, throwing his hands to and fro, casting his looks all around the cottage where she used to move. The cottage, devoid of Sita looked like a lotuspond, the beauty of its lotuses destroyed by winter. Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, hurtled in, turning round, throwing his hands to and fro, casting his looks all around the cottage where she used to move. The cottage, devoid of Sita looked like a lotuspond, the beauty of its lotuses destroyed by winter. The trees with flowers withered, the animals and birds turned pale looked as if they were weeping. Bereft of their beauty they wore a ruinous look. The sylvan deities had left.  The deerskin and kusa grass were strewn here and there, the grass cushions and straw mats lay scattered. Seeing his cottage so desolate Rama wept again and again. The trees with flowers withered, the animals and birds turned pale looked as if they were weeping. Bereft of their beauty they wore a ruinous look. The sylvan deities had left.  The deerskin and kusa grass were strewn here and there, the grass cushions and straw mats lay scattered. Seeing his cottage so desolate Rama wept again and again. 'Timid Sita might have been abducted or dead or crushed or eaten up by demons. Or, she may be hiding for protection in the forest' 'Maybe she has gone to pluck flowers or fruits. Or to the lotuspond or river to  fetch water.' He ransacked the forest, yet did not find his beloved. He  appeared like a mad man, his eyes turned red with tears of sorrow. Running from tree to tree, hill to hill, and river to river and weeping, Rama was immersed in a sea of sorrow. O Kadamba tree, tell me if you have seen my beloved with a fair face and with love for kadamba flowers. O Bilva tree, tell me if you have seen a lady delicate like your tender leaf, dressed in yellow silk, a lady whose breasts are round like Bilva fruits. O Arjuna tree, tell me if you know a timid lady, daughter of Janaka and my beloved, fond of Arjuna tree. Is the living or not ? This Kakubha tree rich with tender leaves and flowers (perhaps)knows Maithili whose thighs are beautiful like the trunk of the Kakubha tree. This great Tilaka tree round which bees bumble surely knows the lady who loves to put tilaka marks on the forehead. O Ashoka tree, dispeller of sorrow, by quickly showing me my darling make me ashoka (free from sorrow) as I am griefstricken at heart. O Palmyra tree be kind to me and tell me if you have seen my beautiful beloved who has breasts like ripe palmyra fruit? O Jambu tree, do not hesitate to tell me if you know Sita whose body shines lovely like gold. O Karnikara tree with flowers in full bloom, tell me if you have seen my faithful beloved who is fond of karnikara flowers. Renowned Rama, like a madman confused, approached the Mango, Kadamba , Sal and Jackfruit, Dhava, Champak, Ketaki trees and Pomegranate, Jasmine and Madhavi creepers, in order to make similar queries. Renowned Rama, like a madman confused, approached the Mango, Kadamba , Sal and Jackfruit, Dhava, Champak, Ketaki trees and Pomegranate, Jasmine and Madhavi creepers, in order to make similar queries. Or,  O deer do you know about Maithili who has the eyes of a fawn? My beloved who has the restless eyes of a doe may be found in their company. O elephant tell me if you have seen her whose thighs are like the trunk of an elephant. O best of elephants, tell me if you know her. O tiger tell me freely and fearlessly if you have seen my beloved princess from Mithila with a face like the moon. O lotus eyed darling, why are you running away? I have already seen you.  Why are you hiding behind trees and not replying to me? O my beautiful beloved, stay, stay  Have you no compassion for me ? You are so fond of fun. Why do you avoid me? O lady of lovely complexion, I can see your yellow silk (flying), while you are running away. If you have love for me, stay on. O lady with a sweet smile I have never hurt you. When I am in difficulty it does not behove you to ignore me. It is clear that separated from me, the body of my young beloved is torn off and eaten away by carnivorous demons. Her beautiful face with her sparkling teeth and lips, wellshaped nose, shining earrings has been like the full moon, eclipsed and rendered pale. That delicate, beautiful neck of my beloved having the complexion of a champak flower and adorned with necklaces was perhaps eaten up. Her arms, delicate like tender leaves, their tips (fingers) quivering, adorned with armlets and bracelets have surely been eaten away. The young lady having many relations, forsaken by me, has been (perhaps) picked up by a demon for food and later abandoned halfeaten. O longarmed Lakshmana, are you able to see my beloved anywhere? O noble lady, O darling, where have you gone? O Sita  SIta Rama ran from forest to forest, now jumping, now taking strong strides, but all the time weeping, a madman busy in search of his beloved. He rushed through forests, rivers, hills and mountain streams and through dense jungles with an unstable mind. Rama went about the vast forest searching for the princess from Mithila all over not giving up hope of finding her. He continued to make great efforts for searching his beloved.

                "Rama, son of Dasaratha, saw the empty cottage devoid of Sita. The mats were displaced. He searched everywhere but unable to see Vaidehi lifted his lovely arms and said: Rama, son of Dasaratha, saw the empty cottage devoid of Sita. The mats were displaced. He searched everywhere but unable to see Vaidehi lifted his lovely arms and said: O son of Sumitra, where is my beloved ? Where did she go? By whom was she abducted? Or, devoured? O Lakshmana O Sita if you intend to make fun by hiding behind a tree, I tell you it is enough. Stop it and come to this extremely sorrowful man. O gentle  Sita those fawns who trusted you and played with you, are now separated from you. Brooding over you, their eyes are brimming with tears. O Lakshmana, I cannot live without Sita. I am filled with deep grief on account of Sita's abduction. My late father, the king will certainly see me in the other world (I will definitely commit suicide). My father say will surely in the other world: Without completing the appointed period of the vow taken, how could you come here ? Fie upon you  You are irresponsible. You are ignoble. You are a liar.

O lady of slender waist, leave me not. Separated from you, I will give up my life. Deeply distressed, Rama who was anxious to see Sita, daughter of Janaka, wailed and wailed but could not see her. Lakshmana, dedicated to his wellbeing, spoke to Rama, son of Dasaratha, who was sinking like an elephant into the quagmire, when he failed to trace Sita. Lakshmana, dedicated to his wellbeing, spoke to Rama, son of Dasaratha, who was sinking like an elephant into the quagmire, when he failed to trace Sita. O longarmed, heroic Rama, do not grieve. This forest is full of caves. Let us try together. Sita is madly in love with the forest. She might have entered deep into the jungle or into a fully blossomed lotuspond. Maybe she has gone to take a dip in the river full of reeds and fishes  Or has hidden somewhere for the sake of fun. O best of men, maybe Vaidehi has hidden in the forest intending to scare you and me. She wishes to test our love. O blessed Rama let us ransack the forest immediately. O scion of the Kakutsthas, let us search all over the forest if you please. Do not indulge in sorrow. When Lakshmana consoled him so affectionately Rama became composed. He continued the search with Lakshmana, son of Sumitra. The two sons of Dasaratha went on searching for Sita in forests, mountains, rivers, ponds everywhere. They were not able to find Sita even though they searched all over the mountain slopes, caves and peaks. After searching her all over, Rama said  Saumitri, I am unable to find the noble Vaidehi on the mountain Going about the Dandaka forest Lakshmana, consumed by sorrow, said  to his brother, glowing with brilliance: O longarmed brother O wise sire  just as Visnu obtained the earth by binding Bali you will obtain Sita certainly. Having been addressed thus by Lakshmana, Raghava with a griefstriken heart said these piteous words :' Lakshmana,having  spoken like that very affectionately to Rama,who was disturbed by excessive grief said these words piteously: O wise Lakshmana I have searched the entire forest, the ponds with fully blossomed lotuses, the mountains with many caves and streams. But could not see Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life. O wise Lakshmana I have searched the entire forest, the ponds with fully blossomed lotuses, the mountains with many caves and streams. But could not see Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life. Thus tormented by the abduction of Sita, Rama felt dejected and cried.Overpowered by grief he lost his consciousness for a moment. By grief tormented, limbs enervated, intellect atrophied, senses switched off, he felt anxious and depressed and sighed long and hot. Rama, his throat choked, shed propuse tears, sighing, O my darling. Then Lakshmana, the knower of dharma and a dear friend offered obeisance most humbly with folded palms and consoled Rama in many ways. Without caring  for the words from the lips of Lakshmana, Rama sobbed loudly, unable to see his beloved Sita.

                "The righteous, the longarmed,lotuseyed Rama, unable to see Sita wept with his senses overwhilmed by grief. Under the spell of Cupid, Rama uttered such words in grief which are otherwise unutterable. As if he was seeing Sita (before him) which was not a fact. O my beloved  as you love flowers you are hiding your body behind the branches of the Ashoke tree that enhances my sorrow (paradoxically). O Devi I can see both your thighs which resemble banana trunk hidden behind a banana plant. It is not possible for you to hide them from me. O gentle one  you are wandering in the karnikara garden, laughing and making fun. Enough of this , that causes my pain. O my dear Sita, why are you joking when I am exhausted? Such fun cannot be relished  now. O darling  joking specially in a hermitage  is not appreciated. I know your nature.You love fun. O largeeyed Sita, come here. This cottage of yours is empty. O Lakshmana surely Sita is either devoured by demons or abducted. When I am weeping like this she is not coming to me. O Lakshmana, these herds of deer with their eyes filled with tears are as if telling me that she is eaten away by the demons. Alas, my noble lady, where have you gone? O chaste lady of excellent complexion, that queen Kaikeyi's desire will be fulfilled now. I left home with Sita. How can I reenter the inner apartment without her ? By Sita's abduction it will be  clear to the world that I lack manliness and compassion. My cowardly nature will clearly manifest. After completing the period of my exile when Janaka , king of Mithila, enquires of her welfare how can I face him? If the king of Videha sees me without her, he will surely be distressed and will fall into a swoon for the love of his daughter. Or else, I will not go to the city ruled by Bharata. Without Sita even heaven will be empty for me. Go to the auspicious city of Ayodhya, leaving me here in the woods. I can never live without Sita. While embracing Bharata tightly, repeat my words, 'You are permitted by Rama to rule the earth.' My mother Kaikeyi, Sumitra and Kausalya  should also be offered due obeisance. You should protect them with great effort, carrying out my instructions. My mother Kaikeyi, Sumitra and Kausalya  should also be offered due obeisance. You should protect them with great effort, carrying out my instructions. O Lakshmana, subduer of the enemy this loss of Sita and me should be explained in detail to my mother.

                "Prince Rama, separated from his beloved, lost his senses out of sorrow. Seeing his brother in a distressed state, he sank again into intense grief. Plunged in deep grief, Rama heaved hot sighs and said these words to griefstricken Lakshmanaweeping: I think there is none on earth like me who has performed such forbidden acts.  One grief after the other is successively piercing my heart and my mind. In the past I had certainly done some sinful deeds I often liked the consequences of which have descended on me now as I am experiencing one sorrow after another. O Lakshmana, loss of kingdom, separation from kith and kin, death of father, separation from mother--all these thoughts augment my sorrow faster and in greater measure. O Lakshmana, all this sorrow calmed down when I came to this solitary forest. But with Sita's separation, it was rekindled just as fire blazes forth again with logs of wood. The timid princess of mine forcibly carried away into the sky by a demon must have again and again cried aloud out of fear in a broken voice. Her captivating copper coloured skin, smeared with the best of red sandal paste would not be surely pleasing now, drenched in blood and mud. Her face with her clear, sweet and gentle words and her curly hair falling will no more look bright coming under the grip of demons like the moon eclipsed by Rahu. The bloodthirsty demons must have drunk the blood of my faithful beloved in a lonely place breaking her neck that used to wear beautiful necklaces. The lovely, largeeyed lady separated from me in the desolate forest, abducted and dragged by demons must have cried at that time desperately like a female osprey. On this rock, O Lakshmana, my goodnatured lady with her lovely smile sat with me in the past and chatted with you. Would she have gone to Godavari, the foremost of the rivers so dear at all times to my beloved ? But I think she has not gone there alone at any time. The lady whose face was like the lotus, whose large eyes were like lotus petals could  have gone to fetch lotuses (but) that also is not possible as she has never gone there without me. Could she have gone to the forest where there are many kinds of trees in full bloom inhabited by a variety of birds? That is also not possible as she is timid and too scared to go there alone. O Sungod, you know all the happenings of the world. You are witness to all the deeds of the people, true and false. Tell me where my beloved Sita has gone or has been carried off. My grief never ceases. O Windgod, there is nothing that you know not in all the worlds. Do tell me if  that lady of a noble race has been abducted or dead or is on the way. While Rama was thus in tears, in a state of sorrow and swoon, Lakshmana who was rational and courageous spoke to him words appropriate to the time : O noble prince, give up grief. Take courage. Show enthusiasm to search and find Sita. Enthusiastic people will not get despondent in carrying out the  most difficult tasks. Rama who carries on the (glorious) progeny of the Raghu dynasty, did not (however) consider seriously the words of Lakshmana, a man of great prowess. Forsaking his courage he was once again overtaken by deep sorrow.       Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama in dejection said these pitiable words to Lakshmana,O Lakashmana, go swiftly to the river Godavari and find out if Sita has gone there to get lotuses. Lakshmana, destroyer of enemywarriors, went to the beautiful river Godavari with quick steps following the instruction of Rama. Searching for Sita at the landings of river Godavari, Lakshmana said to Rama, I am unable to find her at these landings.No one responds to my call. Where could Vaidehi, destroyer of sorrow, go? I wonder. I am unable to trace the spot where the daughter of Janaka could be found. Overwhelmed with grief on hearing Lakshmana's words, Rama himself went to river Godavari, and shouted, where are you, Sita? Overwhelmed with grief on hearing Lakshmana's words, Rama himself went to river Godavari, and shouted, where are you, Sita? Like the elements of Nature, river Godavari did not disclose Rama that Sita had been abducted by the king of demons who deserved death. River Godavari (although) prompted by creatures (of Nature) to tell him about his beloved did not respond to brooding Rama. Remembering the evilminded Ravana's appearance and action, the river revealed nothing about Vaidehi out of fear. Disappointed by the river and emaciated by not being able to see Sita, Rama said to Lakshmana : O handsome Lakshmana this Godavari does not at all respond. How can I go to Janaka and my mother without Sita and break this unhappy news? Where could have gone that Vaidehi, who  removed all my sorrows and sufferings when I lost my kingdom and survived on food available in the forest? Away from relatives and away from the princess, I keep awake during nights which seem too long. I will roam about the river Godavari, Janasthana and this mount Prasravana till I find Sita. O mighty Lakshmana these deer are looking at me again and again indicating that they wish to tell me something. With his vision blurred by tears, Rama, the best among men, looked at them and asked them 'Where is Sita'? Thus asked by the prince, all the deer got up suddenly, and pointed towards the southern sky, the direction in which the princess from Mithila was carried off. Looking at the Lord of men (Rama), they started running in that direction. Thus asked by the prince, all the deer got up suddenly, and pointed towards the southern sky, the direction in which the princess from Mithila was carried off. Looking at the Lord of men (Rama), they started running in that direction. Even Lakshmana marked that the deer were showing and looking at the path lying in that direction. Observing intelligently their indications and understanding the meaning of their message, Lakshmana said to his distressed elder brother: O lord these deer are indicating the land on the southern side.Therefore it will be proper for both of us to proceed in the southwestern direction. Maybe we will get some clue or find that noble Sita. O lord these deer are indicating the land on the southern side.Therefore it will be proper for both of us to proceed in the southwestern direction. Maybe we will get some clue or find that noble Sita. Handsome Rama said, 'yes'and started in southern direction, carefully looking at the ground, followed by Lakshmana. Talking with each other, the two brothers took the path on earth strewn with flowers. Seeing showers of flowers fallen on the ground, valiant Rama sadly said these words to sorrowful Lakshmana: O Lakshmana, here are the same flowers I had given Vaidehi to wear in the forest. I can recognize them. I think the Sun, the wind  and the famed earth have done me a favour by preserving these flowers. Rigteous Rama, the best among men, having said these words to the longarmed Lakshmana, asked mount Prasravana, full of streams: O king of the mountains have you seen a lady with beautiful limbs separated from me in this forest tract ? Like a lion aiming at a petty animal, angry Rama  said, O Mountain before I destroy  all your slopes show me that goldenhued Sita with lustre like gold. Like a lion aiming at a petty animal, angry Rama  said, O Mountain before I destroy  all your slopes show me that goldenhued Sita with lustre like gold. Thus addressed by Rama, the mountain echoed as if it was telling about Sita but did not show her to Rama. Rama, Dasaratha's son said to the mountain, The fire of my arrows will reduce you to ashes.You will have no grass, no tree, no twig. You will be unfit to be served any more. O Lakshmana if this river does not tell me about that noble Sita with countenance like the moon, I will drain it dry right now. While Rama was angry with his eyes burning, he saw on the ground as he advanced large footprints of a demon and then the footprints of Maithili which signified as if chased by the demon, she was frightened and was running hither and thither, longing to see Rama. While Rama was angry with his eyes burning, he saw on the ground as he advanced large footprints of a demon and then the footprints of Maithili which signified as if chased by the demon, she was frightened and was running hither and thither, longing to see Rama. Bewildered to see the broken bow and quiver and many splinters of the chariot scattered all over, Rama said to his loving brother Lakshmana: Bewildered to see the broken bow and quiver and many splinters of the chariot scattered all over, Rama said to his loving brother Lakshmana: O Saumitri  see the many broken bits of gold ornaments and garlands. See, O Lakshmana, the patches of blood looking like drops of shining gold spread all over the ground. O Lakshmana, Vaidehi might have been cut into pieces, and eaten up by the demons who can assume any form at their free will. O Lakshmana, two demons might have fought a dreadful duel at this place contesting with each other for the sake of Vaidehi. O handsome Lakshmana whose is this huge bow embedded with pearls and gems and adorned with gold fallen on the ground? Whose is this shield of gold studded with Vaidurya, broken and strewn all over the ground, shining like the morning Sun? Whose parasol is this with a hundred spokes, festooned with wonderful flowers thrown down on the ground with broken staff ? Whose are these donkeys, with golden chestcoverings, with the devil's face, fierceful and huge and slain in the encounter ? Whose war chariot with a battle flag is this, shining like burning fire, turned upside down and broken? Whose are these pointless arrows of the size of a chariot axle adorned with bright gold destroyed and scattered ? Who is he that has performed such terrible deeds? O Lakshmana  look at these two quivers filled with arrows and lying shattered.  The charioteer is holding a whip and reins in his hands and is lying dead. To whom do they belong? O best among men, O handsome Lakshmana see these carriers of fans with head dress and earrings studded with gems lying slain in the combat. Whose are they ? This indeed is the path the man or the demon has traversed. My enmity with him now has become hundredfold. This will end only with the extermination of his life. O handsome one, those demons can change their form at will and are of dreadful nature. Have they abducted or devoured or killed her in this great forest. Even her righteousness could not protect the helpless Sita. If Sita has been devoured or kidnapped, none in this world or even gods could do anything to make me happy, O handsome Lakshmana O Lakshmana even the compassionate and heroic Creator of the worlds will be disrespected by all beings, however ignorantly (if such things are allowed to happen). The gods will certainly consider me a man engaged in the welfare of the world, a man of selfrestraint and compassion, but at the same time a weak man. O Lakshmana even demerits turn into merits when they come in contact with me. Just as the Sun shines, effacing the moonlight, my brilliance will outshine my demerits of exterminating all (wicked) beings including the demons. O Lakshmana even demerits turn into merits when they come in contact with me. Just as the Sun shines, effacing the moonlight, my brilliance will outshine my demerits of exterminating all (wicked) beings including the demons. O Lakshmana, neither yakshas, nor goblins nor demons nor kinneras nor humans  will be in peace now. O Lakshmana, just see, I will fill the sky with all my weapons and arrows and make all movements impossible in the three worlds. I will obstruct the movement of planets and the Moon, destroy the radiance of the Sun, the fire and block the wind crush the mountain tops, dry up the tanks, destroy the trees shrubs and creepers and annihilate the oceans. I shall bring about this fatal change at once in the three worlds.

Lakshmana no beings will be able to move in the sky, blocked by arrows released from my bowstring there will be no space left there. O Lakshmna now beasts and birds will be confused and destroyed by my darts.You will see them crossing all limits of propriety. For the sake of Maithili I will render this world devoid of goblins and demons with my irresistible arrows pulled up to my ears. Now the gods will witness the power of my arrows released in great rage which can hit distant targets. My anger will destroy all the gods, demons and evil spirits. They will be extinghished from the three worlds. The worlds of gods, yakshas or even demons torn into shreds by my arrows will not  survive. If the gods do not hand over Sita to me either carried away or dead I will transgress these worlds, O Lakshmana If my beloved Vaidehi is not given back to me in her true form I will destroy the three worlds with all animate and inanimate beings. After speaking these words, handsome Rama, his eyes red with anger, pressed his bow, took out the glowing arrow that was dreadful like a poisonous serpent, fixed it to his bow and said these words in a rage like the fire at the time of dissolution of the world.

                "Tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world, Rama looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage.

Lakshmana who had never seen Rama in such anger before said to him with folded hands and parched throat. Earlier you were gentle, self restrained and engaged in the welfare of all beings. (Now) it is not proper for you to give up your natural composure in anger. In you are always present the grace of the Moon, the radiance of the Sun, the motion of the wind, the forbearance of the earth and reputation. To destroy the world for the mistake of a single person is not proper. Why and by whom is this warchariot broken with weapons and all its accesories I do not know. O prince, this place is damaged by the hooves of the horses and the rims of the chariot. It is soaked with drops of blood.Very dreadful must have been the fight here. O, best of the eloquent  this fight involves only one and not two. I do not see the footprints of a big army. To destroy the entire world for one individual is not right. The lords of the earth should remain gentle, peaceful and punish only the deserving. You are the ultimate resort and refuge of all beings. Who would like that your wife should be abducted ? Just as pious men do not do anything disagreeable towards persons who observe religious vows, so also rivers, seas and mountains, gods, gandharvas and demons are not capable of causing unhappiness to you. O king bow in hands, followed by me and with the help of great sages you should search for the one who has abducted Sita. We will search oceans, mountains, forests and several dreadful caves, rivers and lotusponds. We will search relentlessly for the abductor of your wife everywhere including the world of gods and gandharvas till we find her. O lord of Kosala when gods do not restore Sita on request, then you can think of taking action at the appropriate time. O king if you fail to get Sita through appeasement, through humility or diplomacy then you destroy (the three worlds) by your goldtipped stream of arrows comparable to Indra's thunderbolt.

                "Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, consoling the mighty miserable Rama, who was afflicted with sorrow, and was weeping helplessly like an orphan, drowned in great delusion, devoid of consciousness, pressed his feet and addressed him: Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, consoling the mighty miserable Rama, who was afflicted with sorrow, and was weeping helplessly like an orphan, drowned in great delusion, devoid of consciousness, pressed his feet and addressed him: O Rama king Dasaratha begot you by doing a great penance and performing great deeds, just as gods begot the nectar. King Dasaratha, impelled by your virtues, and separation from you attained godhood as heard from Bharata. O best of men  if you grieve and burn the world with your brilliance, wherefrom will the (ordinary) afflicted people get relief? It is the go of the world. Yayati, son of Nahusa, shared heaven with Indra but because of his curse (for his bad conduct) suffered misfortune. To sage Vasistha, our father's priest, were born a hundred sons in a day.But all of them were killed in one day the same way. You (rigidly) adhere to truth.(Like you) the mother earth who is adored by all the worlds, is unshakeable. Yet she is seen to be shaking at times. The powerful Sun and Moon, righteous entities, who are the two eyes of these worlds and on whom everything rests firmly, also suffer eclipses sometimes. O best among men  Fate spares none. Great beings, every creature, even the gods cannot escape fate. It is I heard that Indra and other deities are also governed by the principle of justice. Therefore, you should not bewail, O tiger among men. Even if Vaidehi is killed or abducted, you should not grieve like ordinary men, O sinless hero O Rama, you always see the truth. So  in the face of great difficulties men like you, whose vision is not blurred, should not lose heart. O best among men  judge the facts rightly with your intellect. The wise apply their minds and know what is right and what is wrong. Good results are not expected from the actions of persons who cannot distinguish between their virtues and vices, from those who are unstable in their deeds. O Rama you yourself in the past have instructed me many times that way. Who can be your adviser in this matter ? You are indeed like Brihaspati. Even gods cannot fathom your intellect. I am only trying to rouse your wisdom your sorrow has sent to sleep. O bull among the Ikshvakus, weigh your divine and human prowess before you try to kill your enemies. O best among men  where is the good in the destruction of all? Know your sinful enemy before you uproot him.       Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Even though Rama was elder, he could grasp the quintessence of the wise counsel only after Lakshmana had said it. Restraining his anger, the longarmed Rama leaned over  his wonderful bow and spoke to Lakshmana: O dear Lakshmana, what shall we do? Where do we go ? Think of some means by which we can reach Sita. Lakshmana said to Rama, afflicted with grief, It is proper for you to (first) search in this Janasthana, covered with different kinds of trees and creepers, and teeming with demons. Here are difficult mountains, caves, valleys, dreadful caves full of different animals, dwellingplaces of kinneras and mansions of gandharvas. Here are difficult mountains, caves, valleys, dreadful caves full of different animals, dwellingplaces of kinneras and mansions of gandharvas. Accompanied by me you should search for her in those spots. Great people endowed with wisdom do not destabilise in difficulties just as mountains are not shaken by the speed of the wind. Thus advised, the angry Rama fixed a sharp arrow to his bow and roamed in the forest accompanied by Lakshmana. Then he saw the great Jatayu, a wonderful bird, looking like a mountain top, drenched in blood and fallen on the ground. On seeing Jatayu looking like the peak of a mountain, Rama said to Lakshmana, There is no doubt that this bird has devoured Vaidehi. This demon in the guise of a vulture has evidently eaten away the largeeyed Sita and is happily relaxing in the forest. With my terrific arrows with burning tips that can go straight I will kill him. This demon in the guise of a vulture has evidently eaten away the largeeyed Sita and is happily relaxing in the forest. With my terrific arrows with burning tips that can go straight I will kill him. Having siad so, Rama took his bow, fixed the sharp arrow, and aimed at the vulture. The seabound earth trembled. But the vulture who was in a piteous state, vomitting foamy blood, spoke these words pathetically to Rama, son of Dasaratha: O Longlived one  she who you are searching in the forest like herbal medicine has been carried away by Ravana along with my life. I have seen her snatched from you and from Lakshmana and carried off by powerful Ravana. I descended down to protect Sita, and in the battle with Ravana his chariot destroyed fell down here on the ground. O Rama this is his broken bow, this is his quiver and this is his warchariot all devastated by me. He is Ravana's charioteer slain by my wings in the battle.  As I was exhausted in the encounter Ravana clipped my wings,  took Sita, and flew into the sky. You need not kill me. I am already slain by the demon. He is Ravana's charioteer slain by my wings in the battle.  As I was exhausted in the encounter Ravana clipped my wings,  took Sita, and flew into the sky. You need not kill me. I am already slain by the demon. Having known from Jatayu the story of his beloved Sita, Rama was full of tears, his grief redoubled. Rama dropped the bow and embraced the king of birds. He fell down despondent on the ground and began crying along with Lakshmana. Rama saw Jatayu breathing with difficulty in that solitary, inaccessible place.Overcome by greater grief  he said to Lakshmana: I have been expelled from the kingdom. I am made to stay in the forest. I have lost Sita (my beloved wife). This bird (who was my wellwisher) has been slain. Such misfortune will burn even fire. Now if I enter even the great sea, the lord of the rivers filled with water, it will also dry up due to my misfortune. In this world of the animate and the inanimate there is no one more unfortunate than me fallen into the trap of adversities. This aged king of birds is my father's friend. To my illluck, he is struck down and is lying on the ground. Saying such words and showing filial affection, he caressed Jatayu repeatedly with Lakshmana. Rama hugged the king of vultures with servered wings, drenched in blood and asking him where Sita who was as dear to him as his life was, he dropped him and fell down on the ground.       Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing the vulture lying on the ground thrown down by the fierce demon, Rama said to friendly Lakshmana: Struck down by the demon in the combat on my account this bird is going to give up his life which is indeed difficult. O Lakshmana, it appears he is frightened and is experiencing excruciating pain in the body. His voice sounds faint, too. O Jatayu If you are still able to speak, tell me about Sita and about how you have been struck down. Why did Ravana abduct Sita? What fault did he find with me so that he kidnapped my beloved ? O best of birds how did her delightful, Moonlike face look when she was hijacked. What did she say at that time? O father  how powerful is that demon ? How does he look?What work does he do? Where does he dwell? Do answer my questions? Thereafter Jatayu, a piteous soul, looked up at Rama who was  crying incessantly and said this in a feeble voice: Ravana, the lord of the demons created violent winds through terrific magic and whisked her away in the sky. O my child  when I was exhausted, that demon cut off my wings and carried Sita off in the southern direction. O scion of the Raghu race, I am gasping for breath. My eyes are reeling. I see root hair growing on the tops of golden trees. The time Ravana kidnapped Sita is known as 'Vinda'. The effect (of that time), is that her husband will regain his lost wealth. O scion of the Kakutstha race  he (Ravana )did not know it. Ravana, king of the demons, will perish soon for running away with your beloved Janaki just like a fish carrying away a fishhook (which causes its destruction). You need not worry about Janaka's daughter. You will soon enjoy the company of your beloved, Vaidehi after killing that demon. As he(Jatayu) was speaking to Rama with an alert mind even while dying, blood mixed with flesh started oozing from Jatayu's mouth. Ravana was Visrava's son and Vaisravana's (Kubera's) brother, said Jatayu and gave up his rare life. As Rama was saying to the vulture with folded palms 'Tell me, tell me'( about Ravana) the life breath of the vulture soared into the sky leaving the body. Then Jatayu dropped his head down, his feet thrown about, his body outstretched on earth. Stricken with deep grief, his eyes red (with tears) Rama saw the vulture looking like a mountain. Seeing him dead, he said to Lakshmana: Dwelling for many years happily in Dandaka forest, the abode of demons, the bird lost his life (on our account). This Jatayu, who lived for long years, is lying dead now. (The dictate of) destiny is inescapable. O Lakshmana, see this Jatayu, my benefactor, killed by the powerful Ravana while he was reaching out to help Sita. This lord of the birds left his ancestral kingdom of viltures and gave up life for my sake. O Lakshmana valiant souls and protectors, being righteous and honest are found even among animals and birds. O scorcher of enemies, O handsome Lakshmana the grief I experience due to Jatayu's death on my account is more intense than Sita's abduction. This lord of the birds for me is as worthy of reverence and honour as the famous and prosperous king Dasaratha. O Saumitri  fetch firewood. I shall generate fire by rubbing them and cremate the king of the birds who has laid down his life for my sake. O scion of the Raghus  I will place the body of the lord of the world of birds, killed by the fierce demon, on the funeral pyre and crimate him with honour. O mighty lord of the birds  by my grace attain the state of those who perform sacrifices, who kindle and maintain sacrificial fires, who beat no retreat from the battlefield and who offer land in charity. Purified by my offering of fire, you may depart for the best of the worlds. O mighty lord of the birds  by my grace attain the state of those who perform sacrifices, who kindle and maintain sacrificial fires, who beat no retreat from the battlefield and who offer land in charity. Purified by my offering of fire, you may depart for the best of the worlds. Thus said, righteous Rama laid him on the pyre and sadly cremated the lord of the birds as one would do to his own relative. Then the mighty Rama, accompanied by Saumitri, got into the forest and killed a huge deer, brought it and spread it as an offering (to the dead Jatayu). Tearing the flesh of the deer to pieces and making them  into balls, the celebrated Rama laid it on a lovely, green grassy land as offering to the bird. Rama muttered the mantras recommended by brahmins for dead mortals as one would do for his father, to help him ascend to heaven. Then both the princes went down to river Godavari and offered libations for the king of vultures. Thereafter both the scions of the Raghu dynasty bathed in water, offered libations for the king of vultures as ordained in the scriptures. The king of vultures had performed a very difficult and glorious feat by laying down his life fighting. Sanctified by Rama's offering as laid down in scriptures by the seers, he attained a holy, auspicious and divine state of the self. Rama and Lakshmana, like two lords of gods, Indra and Visnu, offered libations for the great bird with their settled minds and concentrated and then entered deeper into the forest turning their attention to the search for Sita.       Thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama and Lakshmana offered libations (for Jatayu) and went westward, looking for Sita in the forest. Wielding bow, arrows and sword, both the princes of the Ikshvaku race went southward and entered an untrodden (densely wooded) tract. It was a dense, impenetrable and dreadful forest covered with shrubs, trees and creepers spread all over. The two mighty heroes swiftly forged through the great forest, which was an abode of serpents and lions. Both the mighty princes of the Raghu dynasty covered a distance of three krosas from Janasthana and entered the impassable kraunchaforest. Tormented due to abduction of Sita, the two princes anxious to see her searched all over the dense forest stopping here and there on the way. The thick forest looked like a conglomeration of big clouds. It was filled with different kinds of birds, snakes and animals.

The thick forest looked like a conglomeration of big clouds. It was filled with different kinds of birds, snakes and animals. Then both the sons of Dasaratha, went further east, crossed the kraunchaforest after three krosas. They saw a dreadful forest which was full of fierce animals and birds near the hermitage of sage Matanga. It was densely covered with trees. They saw there a cave perpetually enveloped in darkness which was as deep as the netherworld. Then both the sons of Dasaratha, went further east, crossed the kraunchaforest after three krosas.

They saw there a cave perpetually enveloped in darkness which was as deep as the netherworld. Both the princes,the best among men, reached the cave and saw a huge demoness with a disfigured face not far from the cave. Then the two brothers saw a fearful demoness who could strike terror in the mind of the timid, an uncouth figure with huge curved skins, with a big stomach, dishevelled hair, sharp and long teeth, devouring wild animals. Then the two brothers saw a fearful demoness who could strike terror in the mind of the timid, an uncouth figure with huge curved skins, with a big stomach, dishevelled hair, sharp and long teeth, devouring wild animals. She came close to them, held Lakshmana who was walking ahead of his brother and said Come, let us enjoy. Taking hold of Saumitri the demoness said 'I am Ayomukhi and I have been obtained by you. You got me, O hero, O lord  For the rest of your life you will sport with me on the lofty hills and river banks.' Taking hold of Saumitri the demoness said 'I am Ayomukhi and I have been obtained by you. You got me, O hero, O lord  For the rest of your life you will sport with me on the lofty hills and river banks.' Thus addressed, Lakshmana, subduer of enemies, became angry, took out the sword and cut off her ears, nose and breasts. When the ears and nose of the frightening demoness were cut off she shouted in a fierce tone and ran away in the direction she had come from. The destroyers of enemies, Rama and Lakshmana of great valour went through the dense forest after she ran away. Lakshmana of great brilliance and power, of good conduct and pure character spoke to his highly effulgent brother with folded hands: My arm is throbbing heavily. My mind is agitated. The omens I see foretell some undesirable events. O noble brother be alert. Heed my words of good advice. The bad omens I see presage perils. This vanchulaka bird's loud and dreadful screams suggest our triumph in war. As both the brothers with great prowess were searching for Sita all over, a huge sound exploded as if shattering the forest. It appeared as though a fierce wind rose from the forest and filled the sky. While looking for the sound, Rama with his brother saw a demon with a huge body and a big belly. Then both the brothers saw a very tall figure with a trunk that stood facing them. He had neither neck nor head. His face was in the stomach. With sharp bristled hair all over the body, he was a mammoth figure who looked like a mountain  resembling a dark cloud with his voice like the thunder. He had a single eye that was reddishbrown in colour resembling flaming fire. It was fixed in the chest. His eyelashes glowed. He had instant vision with massive fangs in his huge mouth. He was licking his lips. He had a single eye that was reddishbrown in colour resembling flaming fire. It was fixed in the chest. His eyelashes glowed. He had instant vision with massive fangs in his huge mouth. He was licking his lips. The terrific demon kept eating bears, lions, deer and elephants, catching with both his arms stretching up to one yojana. He stood rooted there, catching bears, flocks of birds and deer with both his hands stretching up to one yojana, pulling and pushing them. (Now) he obstructed the path of the two brothers. Then the brothers after covering one krosa (2 miles) saw a cruel, fierce, mighty monster named Kabandha looking like a trunk. He had a dreadful appearance and his arms encircled the area. Then the brothers after covering one krosa (2 miles) saw a cruel, fierce, mighty monster named Kabandha looking like a trunk. He had a dreadful appearance and his arms encircled the area. The longarmed demon spread his hands and caught hold of Rama and Lakshmana together by pressing them with all his force. The two mighty brothers who wielded swords and strong bows and whose bodies were of fiery splendour became helpless, seized by the hands of Kabandha. Of the two heroes, Rama being courageous was not worried but Lakshmana being younger and not having as much courage, was very much concerned and depressed. He said to Rama: O heroic Rama see how helpless I am under the control of the demon. Set yourself free, leaving me alone and using me as an offering. Giving me to this monstor as an offering, you may run away happily. I think you will soon obtain Vaidehi. O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, on getting the hereditary kingdom and ruling over it you should always remember me. O  valiant Lakshmana, a hero like you should not get desparate. said Rama to Saumitri when he was thus entreated by Lakshmana. In the meanwhile the foremost of the demons, Kabandha, rumbling like thunder questioned the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana: Who are you with bulllike shoulders, wielding big swords, bows and arrows? By coming to this place you have become my food. For what purpose have you come? What work have you here ? You have come at the right time as my food, since I am hungry. Holding bows, arrows and swords, looking like bulls with pointed horns you have entered my mouth. It is impossible for you to live any more. On hearing the words of the evilminded Kabandha, Rama said to Lakshmana with dried up mouth: O Lakshmana, your valour is truth.We have gone through from one calamity to a greater one without finding the beloved Sita. Now we have landed into a terrible crisis which will put an end to our own life. O tiger among men see how powerful the might of time is for all beings Just see  yourself and myself afflicted wth this great calamity. O Lakshmana look at the power of time over all creatures There is nothing too heavy for time. Even those who know the use of arms in war, or are brave or strong enough, cannot  withstand the force of time like the barriers built with sand. O Lakshmana look at the power of time over all creatures There is nothing too heavy for time. Even those who know the use of arms in war, or are brave or strong enough, cannot  withstand the force of time like the barriers built with sand. Firm in the strength of truth, famous and powerful Rama, son of Dasaratha,  determined to act with a steadfast mind, spoke to Lakshmana of mighty manliness on seeing him.       Thus ends the sixtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Kabandha saw the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, stand there bound by the shackles of his arms and said: O bulls among the kshatriyas You are sent by destiny as food to appease my hunger. Seeing me hungry, why do you stand there with your senses switched off ? Having heard this, Lakshmana, who was greatly suffering gathered courage at appropriate time and said these salutary words: Before this vile demon gulps you and me let us cut off his long arms with our swords. This huge, horrible demon with the strength of his arms has conquered the world, and now intends to kill us here. O prince of the Raghu race  just as the animal brought in the midst of a sacrifice should not be killed, so also for a king to kill any harmless creature is despicable. The cruel, ferocious demon heard them talk. He opened his mouth and attempted to eat both of them. Then the agitated brothers, aware of time and space, quickly pulled out their swords and cut off both his arms from the shoulders. While standing on the right, Rama cut off his right arm and the brave Lakshmana cut off the left. The strongarmed demon, his arms severed, rumbling like a raincloud filling the sky, the earth and the quarters, fell down. The demon with his arms amputated, drenched in a pool of blood  looked pathetic and asked them, Who are you? Imbued with auspicious signs, Lakshmana revealed the identity of Rama to great Kabandha. Here is Rama, an heir of the Ikshvaku family, known to the people and I am his younger brother Lakshmana for your information. He is equal to a god in prowess. While living in this desolate forest his wife has been carried off by a demon. We both came here searching for her. Who are you with only the trunk of the body, and a glittering mouth in the chest with your calf muscles broken rolling down in the forest? While hearing Lakshmana, Kabandha, reminded of Indra's words, replied to him in great joy : O tigers among men you are welcome. It is my good luck that I am able to see you. It is my good luck also that the arms that bound you have been amputated. O best among men hear how I have been deformed due to my haughtiness.

                "O longarmed, mighty and powerful Rama in the past I was handsome like the Moon or Indra or the Sun inconceivable to all the three worlds. With my appearance, I was a great nuisance to the world and used to terrorise the sages living in the forest. With my appearance I invited the wrath of Sthulasira who I assaulted among the many seers, while he was collecting food in the forest. Seeing me he pronounced a dreadful curse on me saying, 'You will get a cruel, despicable form.' When I sought to know how the curse angrily pronounced on me would come to an end, he said: 'When Rama gets your arms in a desolate forest amputated and your body cremated, you would get back your gloriously auspicious form.' O Lakshmana know that I was the prosperous son of demon Danu. By the wrath of Indra in the battlefeild I obtained this form. I pleased the creator Brahma with great penance. He blessed me with long life. Then this pride and confusion overtook me. Having been blessed with long life and thinking, what can Indra do to me?, I attacked him. The thunderbolt having a hundred nodes deployed by Indra pierced my thighs and my head. Entreated, he did not send me to the abode of Yama ( lord of death) and said, 'Let the words of the creator be true' . Hit by the thunderbolt, my thighbones, head and face were broken. Somehow I could manage to live for a long time without food. Having been entreated, Indra created in me two long arms extending upto a yojana and set my mouth with sharp teeth in the stomach. Stretching the long arms in the forest, I dragged creatures like lions, tigers, elephants and deer moving in the forest and ate them. Indra too had said, 'When Rama along with Lakshmana cuts off your arms in a fight,  you would reach heaven.' O Rama, the best of kings I thought it was only proper in this forest and with this body to catch whatever creature I saw. O Rama, I was struggling to preserve my body all the time thinking that some day you would certainly come into my arms. You are that Rama. Be blessed. As stated by the seer I cannot be really killed by any one except you. O best among men I will help you with my wisdom and give you friendly advice when I am purified by you both through cremation on the funeral pyre. Rigteous Rama spoke the following words in response to the story of Danu within Lakshmana's earshot: My illlustrious wife Sita was carried away by Ravana comfortably when I was away from Janasthana along with my brother. I only know his name. We do not know how he looks, where he lives and what influence he has. Creatures like you may help those who, like orphans, run here and there, stricken with sorrow. O hero we will cremate you in a huge pit to be prepared for this occasion, collecting dry logs of wood broken by elephants. If you really know where SIta has been kidnapped and by whom, tell me. You will be doing a great service. Danu who was proficient in speech spoke with chosen words to Rama who was a great speaker himself: I do not have divine wisdom (now). Nor do I know Sita. When you cremate me, I shall assume my original form and will tell you the name of the person who knows it. O lord before I am cremated, I do not have the ability to know  about that powerful demon by whom Sita has been abducted. O Rama due to the curse I have lost my wisdom. By my own deed, I have attained this form despicable to the world. Before the Sun  disappears with his tired horses drop me into a pit and cremate me in accordance with tradition, O Rama O heroic Rama, delight of the Raghus, if you drop me in a pit and cremate me as per custom, I will tell you about him who knows the demon. O Rama you should establish friendship with him in a just manner. That hero of swift action will help you when he is pleased. O Rama, there is nothing that he does not know in the three worlds. In the past for a different reason he roamed all the (three) worlds.       Thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus said by Kabandha, the two lords of men, the heroes reached a cave in the mountain and lighted the fire. Lakshmana lit the pyre with big meteorlike logs on all sides and it burned. As the flesh of Kabandha's body decomposed, if burnt slowly in the fire although it was like a huge mass of fat. Mighty Kabandha shook himself off the funeral pyre and rose like smokeless fire, wearing a pair of clean clothes and a divine garland. Thereafter shining brightly in pure clothes and wearing ornaments all over the body, Kabandha hurtled out happily and instantaneously from the pyre. The effulgent Kabandha rose into the sky on a famous aerial chariot harnessed to swans. Seated on it, he illuminated all ten directions and spoke from the sky,'O Raghava I will truly tell you how you will get Sita, listen to me'. The effulgent Kabandha rose into the sky on a famous aerial chariot harnessed to swans. Seated on it, he illuminated all ten directions and spoke from the sky,'O Raghava I will truly tell you how you will get Sita, listen to me'. O Rama there are six expedients (peace,war,marching,neutrality, alliance, making peace with one and waging war with another, for attaining your goal in the world. Only the unlucky can help the unfortunate. Along with Lakshmna you are passing through a bad period on account of which your wife has been kidnapped and you, lying low, are experiencing great grief, O Rama O Rama, the best of friends  you should certainly make friendship with him. As I think over the matter, I do not see any success if you do not adopt this method. O Rama, listen. I shall tell you. A monkey named Sugriva has been banished from the kingdom in a fit of anger by his brother Vali, the son of Indra. A hero of great selfrespect, he lives with four monkeys on a beautiful mountain Rishyamuka extending up to lake Pampa. This king of monkeys is energetic with great strength and limitless lustre. He is humble and truthful, valiant, patient and intelligent. He is great. He is efficient, eloquent, brilliant. He is mighty and strong. (But) he is banished by his brother from the kingdom, O Rama O Rama he will help you as a benevolent friend in searching out Sita. Do not indulge in sorrow. O best of the Ikshvaku race whatever is due to happen cannot be otherwise.  It is not possible to transgress time (fate). O Rama, immediately proceed today from here to mighty Sugriva. Having reached him, make him your friend without malice in the presence of burning fire. Thinking that Sugriva is only a vanara king, he should not be disrespected. He has a sense of gratitude. He can take any form at will. He is in need of your help although he is very strong. You are both young and able to do the work he wants. Whether his work is done or not, he will fulfil your task. Born of Riksharaja, he is the offspring of the Sungod. He has developed enmity with Vali, and is roaming about the banks of Pampa, suspecting danger from Vali. O Rama, with your weapons kept ready, go to Sugriva, king of the monkeys, a resident of Rishyamuka. He is wandering in the forest. Establish friendship with him. He is the foremost of the monkeys. He knows well by his wisdom all the dwellingplaces of the carnivorous demons in the world. There is nothing unknown to Sugriva in this world as far as the Sun shines, O subduer of enemies Along with his monkeys, he will search all rivers, mountains and caves and will find out your consort. Sugriva will find out the lady of purity and chastity brooding over you in separation in the abode of Ravana. He can send gigantic monkeys in different directions in order to search for her. Sugriva will find out the lady of purity and chastity brooding over you in separation in the abode of Ravana. He can send gigantic monkeys in different directions in order to search for her. Sugriva, king of the monkeys, will reach the demons  and restore you that blameless, beloved consort of yours, even if she is there on top of mount Meru or in the deep underworld.       Thus ends the seventysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having shown Rama the means to find Sita, Kabandha spoke again these significant words: O Rama the delightful path going westward is auspicious for you. It is shining with trees in bloom. There are jambu (rose apple) trees, priyala trees, jackfruit trees, banyan trees, plaksha trees (a tree from which milky latex oozes out), tinduka trees, holy fig trees, karnikaras (of red and white flowers), mango trees and other trees like dryland, thorny trees, tilaka trees, trees that bloom at night, agnimukhya and asoka trees of blue flowers, kadamba trees, karavira trees, red ashoka trees, and paribhadraka trees.

Climbing those trees or else pulling them down with your strength, both of you eat the nectarlike sweet fruits and proceed ahead. O scion of the Kakutstha race  proceeding further you will find another forest of the North Kuru state with trees in bloom resembling the pleasuregardens of Nandana. The trees in that garden with fruits of all seasons drip honey. Like the Chaitraratha garden (of Kubera), it bears fruits of all seasons. The trees with huge branches bent down with fruits look like mountains or clouds. Lakshmana will get you the nectarlike fruits either by climbing the trees or by pulling them down. O brave men, pass from hill to hill, forest to forest in great countries until you reach a lake named Pampa. The slopes of Pampa are without stones or pebbles, O Rama   They are not slippery slopes. They are without moss. The water is neither deep nor shallow. It has smooth beds of sand on the banks and it is full of lotuses and lilies. Moving in the waters of Pampa you will see swans, ducks, krauncha birds and curlews cackling and cooing, O Son of the Raghus. Not knowing that they may be killed, the innocent creatures will not be scared of human beings. Both of you can kill and eat the fat birds comparable to balls of ghee. O Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty  there at Pampa, by shooting an arrow at the choicest  fishes with a single bone, prawns and big fishes, crookedfaced fishes, fishes without scales and fins, baked on iron skewers and cooked will be offered to you by faithful Lakshmana. O Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty  there at Pampa, by shooting an arrow at the choicest  fishes with a single bone, prawns and big fishes, crookedfaced fishes, fishes without scales and fins, baked on iron skewers and cooked will be offered to you by faithful Lakshmana. While you delightedly eat the fishes, Lakshmana will fetch you water in a lotus leaf from the Pampa to drink. The waters of Pampa full of lotuses carry their scent, It  is enjoyable, cool, healthy and clear, resembling silver and crystal. While you delightedly eat the fishes, Lakshmana will fetch you water in a lotus leaf from the Pampa to drink.

O best of men you will see huge boars of delightful appearance that roar like bulls resting in mountain caves, roaming in the forest and coming to Pampa for its water. When you stroll in the evening, you will see the trees laden with blossoms and lake Pampa full of cool water. You will forget your grief. O son of the Raghus  there you will see tilaka trees, night jasmines full of flowers. You will also see blossoming water lilies and lotuses in Pampa. There is no one to wear those flowers. Those garlands do not wilt or wither O Rama While drops of sweat from the bodies of sage Matanga's disciples fell on earth under the heavy load of forest products they carried for their preceptor, they remained in a calm state. Those drops of sweat turned into flowers and those flowers do not wither due to the power of penance of the sages. While drops of sweat from the bodies of sage Matanga's disciples fell on earth under the heavy load of forest products they carried for their preceptor, they remained in a calm state. Those drops of sweat turned into flowers and those flowers do not wither due to the power of penance of the sages. O Kakutstha  even now their attendant, named Sabari, an old ascetic is there even though they have left long ago. O Rama, she is established in righteousness, and you are godlike, and revered by all beings. When she sees you, she will attain heaven. O Rama of the Kakutstha family, you will see on reaching the western bank of Pampa an incomparable site of hermitage concealed in a remote place. The elephants of the forest and on the mountains do not attack the hermitage forbidden by sage Matanga. The elephants of the forest and on the mountains do not attack the hermitage forbidden by sage Matanga. O Rama, you will enjoy your stay in that forest which is like Nandana garden, the garden of the gods, full of various birds. Mount Rishyamuka situated on the bank of Pampa has trees filled with blossoms. It is difficult to climb and is protected by young elephants.This lofty mountain was created by Brahma in olden days. Whatever wealth one dreams of in sleep on top of that mountain he will get on waking up, O Rama If an evildoer or a sinner ascends the (Rishyamuka) mountain, he, in his sleep, will be thrown down with asleep by the demons from there itself. A sinner does not climb this mountain of uneven terrain. If an evildoer or a sinner ascends the (Rishyamuka) mountain, he, in his sleep, will be thrown down with asleep by the demons from there itself. A sinner does not climb this mountain of uneven terrain. O Rama, the trumpeting of the young playful elephants inhabiting sage Matanga's forest can be heard at Pampa. The great, nimble elphants, dark like clouds, drenched with the flow of ichor come together and then separate and scatter. The wandering elephants of the forest drink plentiful water, pure and cool, from Pampa and contented, plunge into the forest. When you see, shining like sapphires, the bears, tigers, antelopes who know no defeat, you will get over your grief. O son of the Kakutstha family, there is a beautiful cave in that mountain covered with a slab of stone. It is difficult to enter. At the eastern entrance of the cave there is a cool watertank. On its bank teeming with various animals are delightful fruits and roots. Sugriva dwells in that cave with four other monkeys. At times he sits on the top of the mountain. Having instructed both Rama and Lakshmana, courageous Kabandha, wearing a flowergarland, shone brightly like the Sun in the sky. Both Rama and Lakshmana, ready to depart, went near the glorious Kabandha waiting in the sky and said, You may go now. Then Kabandha said to the brothers satisfied, You may go now to accomplish your task. Then he took leave. Kabandha assumed his true form, his body shining like the radiance of the Sun. He stood in the sky showing his form and looking at Rama, said, Make friendship with Sugriva.       Thus ends the seventythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The two princes set forth in the western direction towards Pampa shown by Kabandha. Observing the trees loaded with honeysweet fruits on the mountain, Rama and Lakshmana   went to see Sugriva. Rama and Lakshmana halted on the slope of the mountain and then departed for the western bank of Pampa. Both reached the west bank of lake Pampa and saw the delightful hermitage of Sabari. Both reached the beautiful hermitage full of many kinds of trees. There they saw Sabari, and went towards her. On seeing them both, Sabari, an accomplished ascetic, got up with folded hands and touched the feet of the sagacious Rama and Lakshmana. She offered them water to wash their feet and water to sip as per tradition. Then Rama spoke to Sabari who used to perform austere penance: O ascetic   hope you have overcome your obstacles to penance, you have controlled your anger and your desire for food. Is your austerity in progress. O Sweettongued Sabari, have you achieved selfcontrol? Has your mind attained peace ? Have your services to the preceptor yielded results? When Rama asked Sabari who was an old, accomplished ascetic adored by siddhas, she stood in front and replied : On seeing you now my penance has attained fulfilment, my services to my preceptors have borne fruit. O best of men, O highest of the gods my birth has become fruitful today with your worship, (you have made) even attainment of heaven quite certain. O delight of the Raghus, your handsome look has sanctified me, O subduer of enemies, by your grace I will reach the inmperishable worlds. The men I served have ascended heaven on aerial chariots of incomparable radiance the moment you touched Chitrakuta. Those great honourable sages who knew the ways of dharma said: 'Rama would visit this sacred hermitage along with Lakshmana. He would be your guest. Receive him with due honour. And you would attain the great, inexhaustible worlds when you see him.' Those great honourable sages who knew the ways of dharma said: 'Rama would visit this sacred hermitage along with Lakshmana. He would be your guest. Receive him with due honour. And you would attain the great, inexhaustible worlds when you see him.' O best among men I have collected and kept for your sake different kinds of forestfood grown on the bank of Pampa. Entreated by her in that manner, the righteous Rama spoke to Sabari who was established in true knowledge: I have heard from great Danu about your power. If you agree, I would like to see this power in person. At these words from the mouth of Rama, Sabari took them both round the great garden. O delight of the Raghus see this garden looking like the dense cloud. Full of animals and birds, it is popularly known as Matanga garden. My precepters, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit made sacrificial offerings in this great garden, invoked gods through the power of mantras. They brought water and offered oblations to the sacrificial fire. This is the altar named Pratyaksthali where the saints aged and exhausted( by performing chandrayana) whom I worshipped made offerings of flowers with trembling hands. O Rama see, even now they illuminate the sacrificial altars with the power of their penance. They shed light in all directions with a matchless brilliance. Look at the seven seas, which have reached here at their mere thought as they could not reach them due to fatigue from fasting. O delight of the Raghus  look at the bark robes spread on the trees to dry after their bathing which are still wet. The flowers including lotuses offered by the sages while worshipping gods have not yet wilted. You have seen the entire garden and have listened what is to be heard. With your permission I would like to give up this body. I wish to reach those realisers of the Supreme Spirit whom I served and to whom this hermitage belonged. Rama and Lakshmana on hearing the pious words of Savari joyfully exclaimed, This is really wonderful. Looking at Sabari who was steadfast in her vow, Rama said, O ascetic, you have worshipped me with devotion. You may go wherever you like (to the world you desire) With matted locks, tattered bark clothes and deer skin, Sabari consigned her old and emaciated body to the fire at that moment, with the permission of Rama and ascended to heaven, her body glowing like fire. With matted locks, tattered bark clothes and deer skin, Sabari consigned her old and emaciated body to the fire at that moment, with the permission of Rama and ascended to heaven, her body glowing like fire. Adorned with wonderful ornaments and beautiful garlands, anointed with fragrant unguents, robed in most beautiful clothes, she appeared like a streak of lightning, her body shining bright and her face contented. By virtue of her selfmeditation, Sabari went to that sacred world where the holy sages lived because of their good deeds.       Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Sabari departed for heaven with her brilliance, Rama  contemplated (about the power of sages)with Lakshmana. Thinking about the power of the great sages, righteous Rama said to Lakshmana,  his wellwisher with singleminded devotion: O handsome one, we have seen this highly wonderful hermitage, where deer and tigers dwell together with mutual confidence, where birds of all kinds inhabit. O Lakshmana, having bathed in the waters of the seven seas (by taking ritualistic bath in these waters) the manes are offered oblations in accordance with tradition. We have got rid of inauspicious time and good days have come. Therefore, I feel truly happy. Good fortune will appear (now), O Lakshmana, O tiger among men Come, let us go to Pampa, which is pleasing to look at. Sugriva, the rigteous self, the son of the Sun has been staying for fear of Vali at the shining Rishyamuka, not far from here. Come, let us go to Pampa, which is pleasing to look at. Sugriva, the rigteous self, the son of the Sun has been staying for fear of Vali at the shining Rishyamuka, not far from here. I am hastening to see that noble Sugriva the mighty monkey, as the search for Sita depends on him, O handsome one To the words of Rama who was of stable mind, Lakshmana replied : My mind too is hastening me. Let us get there quickly. Then Rama the lord of men along with Lakshmana departed from the hermitage and went to Pampa. He saw the sacred lake Pampa whose sweet flow of water was used by great seers. It abounded in trees and creepers. Its surface was red with lotuses at one place, white with clusters of lilies at another and with blue lotuses at other places. As such, it looked like a carpet with variegated colours. He saw the sacred lake Pampa whose sweet flow of water was used by great seers. It abounded in trees and creepers. Its surface was red with lotuses at one place, white with clusters of lilies at another and with blue lotuses at other places. As such, it looked like a carpet with variegated colours. Rama reached the Matanga lake which he could see from  a distance and bathed in it. Lake Pampa was filled with red lotuses and their fragrance.The bank was lined with blossoming mango trees and trees of several kinds like tilaka trees with fruits full of seeds like citron, dhava trees, white trees in bloom, karavira trees loaded with flowers, punnaga trees, clusters of jasmine and kunda shrubs, fig trees, so also reeds, ashoka trees, atimuktaka creepors and several other trees looking like women adorned all over. Rama and Lakshmana passed by, glancing at them. There were other trees full of flowers, huge trees, koyashtika trees with reed. Different kinds of birds such as peacocks, parrots, dwelling in the forest were screaming aloud. Looking at all these in that forest Rama and Lakshmana passed by undisturbed with a composed mind.

Rama saw lake Pampa with cool waters and the groves on the bank filled with tilaka, ashoka, punnaga, bakula and uddala trees. On seeing different kinds of trees and tanks, the lovestriken Rama visited that great lake. There were lovely pleasuregardens in full bloom  filled with sal and champk trees.

Rama said to Lakshmana, the best of men, who had truth as his strength, Go to Sugriva, lord of the monkeys. O Lakshmana, deprived of the kingdom I have become a destitute. With my heart attached to Sita how can I live without her ? Having said these words to Lakshmana who was listening to him with undivided attention, Rama, the best of the Raghus, oppressed by love and afflicted by tears of grief entered Pampa, the delightful lotuslake. Thereafter, going slowly to a distance, Rama and Lakshmana saw Pampa surrounded by beautiful forests full of many varieties of birds.

                "Arriving with Laksmana at the lake filled with lotuses, lilies and fishes, Rama, his senses oppressed, burst into tears. He was glad to see it but sad at the thought of Sita. His passion stirred, his senses shaken, he said this to Saumitri: 'O Saumitri Pampa looks beautiful with its water clear as vaidurya, its lilies and lotuses in full bloom and its trees in all their variety. 'O Saumitri look at the pleasant forest around Pampa where trees stand splendid like mountainpeaks. Already saddened due to the abduction of Sita and plight of Bharata, I am tormented by Spring. Though stricken with grief, I feel so delighted to see the auspicious Pampa with its wonderful forest and cool water scattered with flowers. Abounding in lotuses, birds and beasts and vicious serpents moving about, it looks splendid indeed. The bluishyellow grass, dotted with different kinds of flowers fallen from the trees shines like a carpet spread. Entwined with flowering creepers the treetops are covered all over with rich loads of flowers. 'O Saumitri it is the season of spring. The trees are laden with fruits and fragrant flowers. Ecstatic blows the gentle freeze. 'Look at the flowering trees sending showers of flowers like water dropping from the clouds, O Saumitri Various forest trees shaken by the force of the wind scatter flowers on the beautiful rocky surface of earth. O Saumitri! look, the breeze appears to be playing with the flowers; that are fallen and that are still on the trees. \"As the wind shakes the flowers off the branches of various trees the bees bumble in tune with the (whistling) wind. \"As if the trees are dancing to the music of the cuckoos and to the sound of the wind coming out of the mountain-caves. \"Shaken by the strong wind all over, the tops of trees look as if they are knitted together. 'The gentle touch of the breeze that blows, cool like sandalwood, full of pure fragrance, takes away the fatigue of the body. As if the trees are singing, swayed by the wind, while the bees in the forest, fragrant with honey, hum in tune. 'The huge trees in the scenic mountainranges look delightful with their blossoms touching the peaks. With the tops of trees covered with flowers, the black bees hovering (humming) over them, the trees, shaken by the restless wind look like singers. (The trees with the top decked with flowers, the bees like black hair on the head swaying in the wind look like dancing and singing) 'See these Karnikaras in full bloom all over, looking like people clad in yellow silk adorned with golden ornaments. 'O Saumitri this spring season resonating with the sounds of several kinds of birds, kindles my anguish as I am separated from Sita. 'Kandarpa (Cupid) torments me while I am already griefstricken. The Cuckoo with his challenging cheerfulness mocks me. 'Lakshmana, while I am already lovestricken, the swamphen (gallinule, a marshbird) troubles me with its joyous cackles in the beautiful foreststream. 'While in the hermitage in the past, my beloved was very glad to hear such sounds, invite me to join her and rejoice again. 'See, the different kinds of birds flying towards trees, shrubs and vines making wonderful sounds all over. 'O Lakshmana the female birds praised by their flocks, are united with their male partners. Enjoying the sweet sounds of large black bees, they are singing melodiously. These trees seem to enkindle my passion through all sorts of sounds like the loud cackle of swamphens and the sweet warble of the male cuckoos. 'The fire of spring with clusters of Asoka flowers as its charcoal, its coppercoloured tender leaves as flames, the buzz of bees as its crackle will, as if, consume me. 'O Saumitri my life is meaningless if I cannot see my beloved Sita with her delicate eyelashes, beautiful locks of hair and her sweet voice. 'O sinless one, the spring season is dear to my beloved Sita when the outskirts of the forest are filled with voices of the cockoo. 'The fire of grief ignited by Kandarpa (the god of love), enhanced by the effects of spring will certainly consume me soon. 'Unable to see my beloved wife, the very sight of these lovely trees intensifies my love for her who shines resplendent in me. 'When in place of Vaidehi I see spring (with its cool breeze) that used to take away the sweat generated by sensual enjoyment, my sorrow is intensified. 'O Saumitri the cruel breeze of the spring forest torments me as I am now immersed in grief in the absence of my fawneyed beloved. 'Delightful are the peacocks dancing here and there, their feathers looking like crystal windows flung open by the wind. 'The peacocks intoxicated with passion for the peahens surround them intensifying my longing (for Vaidehi). 'Look at the lovelorn peahen, excited by love, dancing on the moutain slope, O Lakshmana  Engrossed in love, she dances for wooing the peacock. 'Overwhelmed with love, the enchanted peacock, spreading his wings is running after her, making sounds, as though mocking her. 'The peacock's beloved, for sure, has not been abducted by the demon. Therefore, he is dancing in delight in the forest in the company of his beloved. 'It is extremely unbearable for me to stay in the forest during this season of flowers (Spring). Look at the passion even among beasts and birds, O Lakshmana And craving for love, the peahen sports near her mate. 'Had the largeeyed Janaki not been stolen, she would have also paid advances to me in this manner with all her love and excitement. 'The trees look enchanting with flowers in full bloom, with bees hovering over them. But the flowers fruitlessly drop down on the ground. 'If spring reigns wherever my beloved Sita is, she must have been overwhelmed with similar sad feelings like me. 'Spring must not have touched the place where she is now staying. Otherwise how could my Sita with eyes like blue lotus live without me? 'Or, if there is spring where my beloved lives, what can that lady of beautiful hips do, threatened by enemies. 'Eager to speak with her gentle voice, my young beloved, blessed with eyes like lotus petals, will certainly give up her life, unable to enjoy the spring. 'My mind makes me feel certain that Sita with her chastity might not be able to live separated from me. 'Sita has her love truly fixed in me. My love for her is equally steadfast. 'This cool breeze that carries the fragrance of flowers, that is gentle in its touch feels like fire when I think about my beautiful beloved. 'The pleasant touch of the wind, which made me happy in the company of Sita intensifies my grief now in her absence. 'The crow that cried unhappily flying in the sky as if to foretell my separation from Sita, is now on the tree, singing joyfully (suggesting my possible union with Sita). 'The same crow attendant on Vaidehi there will take me to my largeeyed beloved. 'Losten, O Lakshmana to the sweet warblings of the birds on the blossoming treetops of the forest. My love for her (Sita) enhances with their sweet voices. 'This honeybee is eager to approach the bunch of tilaka flowers in bloom scattered by the wind like a lover advancing towards his passionate beloved. 'This asoka tree increases (by nature) the sorrow of lovers. Perhaps it make its presence felt in order to intimidate me with the clusters of its flowers scattered by the wind. 'O Lakshmana these mangotrees full of blossoms appear like sexited men who have applied fragrant unguents to their bodies. 'O Saumitri O' tiger among men look at the kinnaras wandering here and there, in the wonderful forest around the Pampa lake. 'O Lakshmana look at these lotuses with fine fragrance all over the water glowing like the rising Sun. 'This Pampa with its water clear and fragrant with red and blue lotuses is filled with swans and geese. 'Lake Pampa shines with lotuses with bees on their filaments like the rising sun. 'Frequented by the Chakravakas and surrounded by the wonderful forest with thirsty elephants and deer this Pampa looks beautiful. 'O Lakshmana look at the lotuses in clear water dashing against one another due to waves caused by the force of the wind. 'Unable to see my beloved with eyes large like totus petals and an ardent lover of lotuses, I have no desire to live. 'Oh how adversly disposed is the god of love He makes me remember that auspicious lady with a pleasing voice when she is lost and difficult to reach. 'If the spring that has set in, with the trees in bloom does not kill me, I have once again to endure the agony of love. 'Whatever was endearing to me earlier in the company of Sita, has turned out to be disenchanting without her. 'Seeing the delicate petals around the lotus buds that look like beautiful eyelids of Sita, my eyes crave for them O Lakshmana 'The bleeze that blows through the trees carrying the fragrance of the filaments of lotuses feels pleasant like Sita's breath. 'Look at the very spectacular karnikara tree with its blossmed branches on the mountain slope towards the southern side of Pampa, O Saumitri 'This king of mountains is rich with plenty of minerals and, therefore, generates multicoloured dust particles splattered by the speed of the wind. 'O Saumitri With leafless kimsuka trees in full bloom all over the mountain ranges they appear beautiful like blazing mountains. 'Very closely grown on the banks of Pampa, stand malati, mallika and karavira trees with their clusters of fragrant blossoms. 'Fully blossmed ketaka, sinduvara, madhavi and kunda bushes in spring scatter their fragrance everywhere. 'Chiribilva, madhuka, vanjula, bakula, champaka, tilaka and naga varana and kharjura trees are in full bloom. 'Lotuses and blue asokas are also in bloom. Lodhra trees on the mountainslopes look golden like the lion's mane. 'There are trees like ankola, kuranta, churnaka, paribhadraka, mango, patali, kovidara, muchukunda, arjuna, ketaka, uddalaka, shirisha, shimshupa and shava, all in full bloom on the mountain peaks.

'O Saumitri look at the beauty of these numerous flowering trees on the banks of Pampa, entwining creepers with blooming tops. 'While the branches of trees swayed by the wind draw close, the creepers follow the trees like lovely women in a drunken state. 'The wind blows from tree to tree, mountain to mountain, and forest to forest as though content to enjoy all the fragrance. 'Some trees stood fragrant with profuse flowers and some with buds shining blue. 'Fascinated by the flowers, the honeybees cling to one or the other, humming, 'this is soft, this is sweet, and this is fullyblossomed.' 'The bees greedy for honey move among the trees on the banks of Pampa. Resting for a while, at one place they fly soon to another. 'With countless flowers fallen on their own from trees and scattered like a bed of flowers on stone the ground is rendered comfortable enough to relax on. 'O Saumitri varieties of colourful flowers, some red and some yellow, are spread out on the mountain slopes. 'Winter has ended and the season of flowers has set in, O Saumitri The trees are full of flowers as if competing with one another. 'The trees, crowned with flowers filled with humming bees, look splendid. It appears they are calling one another, O Lakshmana 'This duck, entering into auspicious water, sports with its beloved and incites my love. 'Only Ganga, like Pampa, has such captivating charm. Its beauty and virtues are famous in the world. 'O Lakshmna, the best of the Raghu race, if only that chaste Sita appears, we will stay here. I will not wish for the position of Indra or for Ayodhya. 'If I can sport with Sita in this beautiful green grassy land, I will not have any worry, I would not desire for any other pleasure. 'These trees with their beautiful leaves and varieties of flowers bring me agony as I live in this forest separated from my beloved. 'O Saumitri look at this lake of cool water filled with, lotuses, chakravakas flying about and ducks floating. Pampa, filled with swimming, kraunchas and frequented by big animals looks splendid. The joyous warbling of a variety of birds is highly exciting. They kindle my passion for my young, Moonfaced, lotus eyed beloved. Pampa, filled with swimming, kraunchas and frequented by big animals looks splendid. The joyous warbling of a variety of birds is highly exciting. They kindle my passion for my young, Moonfaced, lotus eyed beloved. Look at the (male) deer happily roaming here and there together with the female deer on the colourful mountain slopes. Separated from the fawneyed Vaidehi, this sight fills my heart with agony. 'If I find my dear beloved here on these mountain slopes full of passionate birds how happy will I not feel 'O Saumitri I can be alive and happy if Sita of slender waist enjoys here with me the sweet breeze of Pampa. 'O Lakshmana blessed are those who enjoy the breeze filled with fragrance of lotuses of the surrounding forests of Pampa. The gentle and auspicious breeze indeed takes away the sorrow of the mind. 'How can Janaka's daughter with eyes like lotus petals, so young and loving, sustain her life? Away from me, she must be feeling quite dejected. 'If righteous and truthful Janaka enquires about Sita's wellbeing in the assembly of people, what am I to speak ? 'She followed me, O Lakshmana  as I was deposed from the kingdom and distraught. Now helpless, how can I live without her? 'Unable to see her beautiful, face with auspicious eyes like fragrant lotuses, I feel (so) depressed. 'When can I listen to Sita's sweet, wholesome and virtuous, incomparable words interlaced with her gentle smile, O Lakshmana? My young and faithful beloved used to put up a brave face and speak to me in all propriety to cheer me up in the midst of suffering in the forest whenever I felt tormented by passion. 'O Prince, what can I tell the highminded Kausalya at Ayodhya when she asks the whereabouts of her daughterinlaw'? 'You may go to Ayodhya, O Lakshmana, to see our loving brother, Bharata. It is not possible for me to survive without the daughter of Janaka'. Thus spoke Lakshmana these befitting, unforgettable words to his hissouled brother, Rama wailing like an orphan: 'O Rama, the foremost of men, control yourself. Be blessed. People who are pure at heart do not feel depressed at heart. 'Remembrance of loved ones causes sorrow. Even a wet cotton wick gets burnt by embracing excessive oil. Hence abandon grief. 'Even if Ravana escapes into the nether world or into a world still lower, he cannot save himself by any means, O Rama 'Once the whereabouts of that sinful demon are known he will either deliver Sita or die. 'Even if Ravana enters into the womb of Diti (mother of demons) along with Sita, I will slay him there if he does not return the daughter of Mithila. 'O noble prince be blessed. maintain composure. Without making any effort it is not possible to achieve the objective and recoup loss. 'O revered Sire, enterprise is supreme strength. Nothing is difficult in this world for one who is up and doing. 'Enterprising men will never be disappointed in their mission. It is possible to get Sita through effort alone. 'Bardon grief. Give up emotion. You are a great soul. You are not aware of your great accomplishments. (The temporary sorrow has relegated Rama's nobility to the background. Lakshmana is trying to restore the same)'. Thus persuaded by Lakshmana, Rama who was hitherto besieged by grief and delusion, could set them aside and regain patience. No more disturbed by delusion, Rama of unimaginable valour, crossed the very brilliant Pampa with beautiful plants floating on its surface. The great Rama was overcome with grief while scanning the entire forest with its streams and caves. Engrossed in her thoughts, dejected at heart and inflicted with pain, he set both, accompanied by Lakshmana. The great soul, Lakshmana, striding like a mighty elephant, with a steady mind, followed Rama dutifully, protecting him with his strength. The swiftfooted, mighty king of monkeys saw those two men of wonderful appearance as they were wandering at Rishyamuka. He neither got scared nor showed signs of nervousness. The great soul, Sugriva, walking slowly like an elephant saw both of them and became despondent, worried and immersed in fear. Having seen the mighty Rama and Lakshmana, all other monkeys got frightened and ran into a sacred and safe hermitage.       Thus ends the first sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On seeing the two great souls, heroic Rama and Lakshmana wielding the best of weapons, Sugriva was alarmed. Agitated at heart, the best of vanaras started in all directions and could not settle down at one spot. Beholding the two strong heroes, the monkey (Sugriva) was very much frightened. His heart sank. Righteous Sugriva, became highly agitated, deliberated with all his followers on the pros and cons of the situation. Sugriva, lord of monkeys, extremely agitated at the sight of both Rama and Lakshmana, spoke to his minister: On seeing these supreme bowmen, Sugriva's counsellers left for the peak of another mountain. The leaders of the monkey troops  reached Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, in no time  and stood surrounding him. Jumping  from one mountain to another swiftly and shaking the mountain tops, the monkeys reached one spot. Then the mighty monkeys jumping on the trees in full bloom shook them. The great monkeys went on leaping all over the great (Rishyamuka) mountain,   scaring the deer, wildcats and tigers. Thereafter, all the ministers of Sugriva assembled together on the king of mountains and stood (in front of Sugriva), with folded hands. Suspecting that Vali might have sent them (Rama and Lakshmana), Hanuman, skilful in communication, said to Sugriva who was trembling in fear: 'This is a great mountain range of Malaya and there is no fear for Vali here. Give up this fear. 'O chief of monkeys I do not see here any sign of the cruel Vali, of whom you are afraid. 'O goodnatured Sugriva you are afraid of your elder brother Vali as he is evilminded and sinful. (But) I do not see any reason for you to be frightened as he is not found anywhere here. 'Oh monkey, whoever is lilylivered cannot be steady. It is evident that your very nature as a monkey makes you restless. Having heard the wise words of Hanuman, Sugriva addressed him with words more auspicious. 'Who would not be apprehensive of these two longarmed and largeeyed individuals     comparable to sons of gods wielding arrows, bows and swords. 'I support these two excellent men might have been sent by Vali. Kings have many friends and so it may not be appropriate to trust any king. 'One has to identify these men roaming in disguise. These are not trustworthy and could even be our enemies, making us believe them so as to attack us when we are not vigilant. 'Vali is wise in his actions. Kings employ many strategies to annihilate their enemies. Our gullible individuals should be able to detect them. 'O Hanuman assume an ordinary form and approach them. Try to read them through their gestures, traits, forms and conversations. 'O best of monkeys ascertain their purpose by praising them and studying their honest intentions. Gain the confidence of the wielders of bows and if you find them agreeable, enquire the purpose of their entering this forest. 'O best of monkeys ascertain their purpose by praising them and studying their honest intentions. Gain the confidence of the wielders of bows and if you find them agreeable, enquire the purpose of their entering this forest. 'O best of monkeys find out whether they are noble in their intentions or evil in their design through your conversation with them.' Instructed thus by the king of the monkeys, Hanuman, son of the Windgod, decided to meet both Rama and Lakshmana. Hanuman, the venerable, powerful and not easily conquerable monkey, honoured the words of the great Lord of the monkeys, offered salutations and said 'So be it'. And then proceeded towards the mighty Rama and Lakshmana.       Thus ends the second sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.",
                "Listening to great Sugriva, Hanuman leaped from mount Rishyamuka on to the location of the Raghavas. Hanuman, son of the Windgod, with an ingenious mind assumed the guise of a mendicant. Approaching the Raghavas in all humility, valiant Hanuman offered them reverential salutations and addressed them in gentle and pleasing words. The valiant son of the Windgod, Hanuman offered those heroes whose power came from their sense of truth due respect and spoke to them in all gentleness: 'You both fair in complexion, resemble royal sages or gods. You appear like ascetics and pursue vows in austerity. How come, you are present here, as if to frighten the animals and other creatures roaming this forest? 'You both fair in complexion, resemble royal sages or gods. You appear like ascetics and pursue vows in austerity. How come, you are present here, as if to frighten the animals and other creatures roaming this forest? 'Gazing at the trees on the bank of Pampa, you both appear in brilliant complexion as if to enhance the beauty of the auspicious river water. Though young, courageous and with handsome shoulders, you seem to sigh in exhaustion. And though you look like ascetics robed in bark,  you seem to terrify these creatures.

'Having the gaze  of a lion, both of you are heroic in your stance. As each of you hold a bow resembling the rainbow, you seem to be mighty warriors eager to annihilate the enemies.

'You are young and radiant like the gods. This king of mountains (Rishyamuka) dazzles with your brilliance. Although you deserve to be sovereigns, how is it that you are here (into the forest)? 'Both of you appear alike, with eyes like lotus petals and locks of matted hair. You look like heroes descending from the world of the gods.

For his wellbeing I came here disguised as a mendicant from  Rishyamuka mountain. I am a monkey, son of the Windgod and minister to Sugriva. I can assume any form at my free will and go anywhere I like'. The eloquent Hanuman, having spoken thus to both Rama and Lakshmana, good at speaking, said no more. Having heard him, the Illustrious Rama cheerfully said to brother Lakshmana standing nearby: 'Here is minister to Sugriva, the great chief of monkeys whom I wish to see. 'O Saumitri, conqueror of enemies this monkey, Sugriva's minister, is skilled in friendly communication. Reply to him in words gentle and sweet. 'Unless wellversed in Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda, for sure, it is not possible for anyone to articulate so well. 'Surely, he seems to have studied well the whole of grammar, for there is not a single mispronunciation in his entire speech. No fault can be found in his face, eyes, forehead, between the eyebrows or any other part of his body (during his expression). His sentences are not too elaborate, not ambiguous, not dragging, not fast, raised in the chest or throat, in a medium tone. 'His words are auspicious. They are refined. Neither fast nor slow, his utterances captivate the heart. 'His colourful words flow from all the three sources: the bottom of his bosom, his throat and his head. Whose mind will not adore them even if one happens to be an enemy holding a sword? 'O sinless one, how can a king, whoever he be, not accomplish his goal in the past with such an ambassador? Whoever has such great taskmasters of great qualities as their envoys, can have all their goals accomplished, driven by their diplomatic skills. Thus instructed, Saumitri who was equally skilled in speach replied to Sugriva's minister, son of the Windgod 'O learned Hanuman having heard about the virtues of  great Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, we eagerly look forward to meeting him 'O virtuous Hanuman we will do whatever you are saying, for it is the message of Sugriva. Pleased with Lakshmana's words spoken in a skilful manner, Hanuman, the monkey son of the Windgod, resolved to make friendship with them.       Thus ends the third sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After listening to the sweet words of Lakshmana, Hanuman, having done what he had to do felt happy and thought of Sugriva. The great Sugriva, thinks Hanuman, who had done his duty is likely to acquire his kingdom, because great Rama who would help in the work of Sugriva has also come.' Hanuman, the best of the monkeys, learned in conversation, felt extremely happy and enquired from Rama: 'Why have you come with your brother to this dreadful, inaccessible forest surrounding Pampa, full of different varieties of serpents and wild animals?' Having listened to Hanuman, and urged by Rama, Lakshmana told him about the great Rama, son of Dasaratha. 'He never hated any one nor did any one ever hate him. To all his subjects, he was like another father, the Creator Brahma. And he was generous in giving gifts while performing yajnas (rituals with fire) like Agnistoma. 'Here is his eldest son, popularly known as Rama. He is the protector of all beings and never failed his father's instructions. 'This glorious Rama was followed by his wife, Sita, like the rays of the effulgent Sun follow him to the end of the day. 'I am his younger brother, called Lakshmana. I have accepted the service of this learned, virtuous and grateful man. 'This man who should have lived in comfort and in reverence, one who was worthy of all the wellwishers lost his wealth and was banished into the forest. He is now deprived of his wife kidnapped by an unknown demon who could assume any form at will. 'This man who should have lived in comfort and in reverence, one who was worthy of all the wellwishers lost his wealth and was banished into the forest. He is now deprived of his wife kidnapped by an unknown demon who could assume any form at will. 'Diti's son called Danu who had been cursed to live the life of a demon had said that Sugriva, the best among monkeys, would be able to locate her. 'That Valiant Sugriva can spot the demon who has abducted your wife', said Danu and disappeared happily into heaven shining in brilliance. 'I have given a factual account of everything, since you asked me. Now Rama and I have arrived seeking Sugriva's shelter. 'Having earned supreme fame through his munificence in the past, this lord of the world now craves Sugriva's indulgence. 'One whose father was once a protector of dharma, a refuge to all now seeks Sugriva's shelter. 'This righteous Rama who used to lend in the past protection to the whole world and, indeed, a refuge to all, venerable sir, now seeks Sugriva's shelter. 'This Rama for whose grace the subjects were ever bobolden to him now seeks the favour of the Chief of monkeys.

'Famous in all the three worlds, this Rama, who was the firshborn of Dasaratha, endowed with all virtues and ever respected by all the kings of this earth, now seeks shelter of Sugriva, Chief of monkeys. 'Sugriva, lord of monkeys, ought to help Rama who tormented by, and overwhelmed with, grief seeks his favour.' To Saumitri who was speaking thus in a piteous tone, his eyes filled with tears the eloquent Hanuman replied: 'It is a matter of great fortune that you who have intelligence, control over your senses and conquered anger have come to see the lord of monkeys who needs instead, to approach you. '(In fact) seriously offended by his brother Vali who treated him like his enemy and expelled him from the kingdom. He is now abandoned in the forest, his wife hijacked. 'Sugriva, son of the Sungod, along with us will extend all help to you, in your search for Sita.' Hanuman, having spoken with sweet, gentle words said to the Raghavas, 'We will now go to Sugriva'. Having offered reverential salutations to Hanuman as per tradition, righteous Lakshmana now spoke to Rama: 'O Raghava this monkey, son of the Windgod appears pleased as evident from his words. As he is a man of action, take your work as accomplished now. 'It is evident from his words  and from his cheerful face that Hanuman is pleased. (I know that) this heroic son of the Windgod will never tell a lie'. Hanuman, son of the Windgod, endowed with great wisdom carried both the Raghava warriors to the king of monkeys. Hanuman, who was an elephant among monkeys, gave up the guise of a mendicant, and assuming the form of the monkeys, lifted both the heroes  on to his back and proceeded. The son of the Windgod, the most valiant, the supremely heroic monkey and the one welladmired, having performed his task, felt immensely happy.And with an auspicious feeling, departed for the great mountain (Rishyamuka) along with Rama and Lakshmana.       Thus ends the fourth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Leaving Rishyamuka, Hanuman reached the Malaya mountain. Seeing the chief of monkeys there, he announced the arrival of  the heroic Raghavas. 'This Rama of greatwisdom and valour, endowed with the power of truth has arrived here along with his brother Lakshmana. 'Born in the Ikshvaku race Rama Dasaratha's son, distinguished for his righteousness is here to carry out the orders of his father. 'While the great Rama armed with selfrestraint was living in the forest, his wife was abducted by Ravana. So he has come to you seeing refuge. 'This Rama, son of a king who had gratified the firegod through many yajnas like  Rajasuya and Aswamedha, gifted hundreds of thousands of cows and ruled this earth with truth and austerity, has come seeking help for a woman.' 'This Rama, son of a king who had gratified the firegod through many yajnas like  Rajasuya and Aswamedha, gifted hundreds of thousands of cows and ruled this earth with truth and austerity, has come seeking help for a woman.' 'Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana seek friendship with you. As both of them are worthiest of worship, welcome them with due reverence.' Hanuman's words took away Sugriva's great fear for Rama and filled him with cheer. This bull among monkeys gave up his natural appearance and and assuming an attractive human form spoke to Rama lovingly: Hanuman's words took away Sugriva's great fear for Rama and filled him with cheer. This bull among monkeys gave up his natural appearance and and assuming an attractive human form spoke to Rama lovingly: 'You are a great hero, affectionate to all and wellversed in all dharmas. The son of the Windgod has, in fact, apprised me  of your virtues 'O Lord that you are eager to have friendship with me, who is a monkey is a great honour and is extremely beneficial to me. 'If you are desirous of my friendship, here is my arm (palm) stretched out to you. With due regard, establish our bond firmly, holding my palm in yours.' Rama became very happy to hear Sugriva's warm words and pressed his hand with his. Delighted, he went close  to Sugriva and hugged him tightly and  affectionately. Then, Hanuman vanquisher of enemies, gave up his guise of a mendicant, assumed his natural form and generated fire by rubbing two pieces of wood. Wellpleased at heart, he made an offering of flowers to the flaming fire and placed it between them. Then, Hanuman vanquisher of enemies, gave up his guise of a mendicant, assumed his natural form and generated fire by rubbing two pieces of wood. Wellpleased at heart, he made an offering of flowers to the flaming fire and placed it between them. They both circumambulated the blazing fire and solemnized their friendship. Rama and the monkey contented at heart, yet not fully content, continued looking at each other. 'You are a dear friend to me. Your sorrow is my sorrow, your pleasure is my  pleasure. We are one and the same' said Sugriva to Rama, his heart overflowing with happiness. Then Sugriva cut the branch of a sala tree with luxuriant leaves and flowers, spread it on the ground and sat down along with Raghava. Then Hanuman, the bull among monkeys, felt very happy, cut the branch of a sandalwood tree full of flowers and gave it to Lakshmana. Then Sugriva, eyes sparkling with joy, replied to Rama in a sweet, gentle voice. 'O Rama, I have been insulted deeply and my wife hijacked. Stricken with fear I have taken refuge in this inaccessible forest. 'O Rama humiliated by my brother Vali, I have developed enmity with him. Terribly distraught and disturbed I live in this forest in great fear. 'O reverend Kakutstha, I feel helpless with fear from Vali. Save me. You should release me free from fear.' The righteous and glorious Rama to whom dharma is very dear said to Sugriva with a gentle smile on his face, when he was entreated thus: 'O great monkey I know friendship is the fruit of a beneficial deed. I will kill that Vali who has usurped your wife. 'These arrows covered with kanka feathers, sharp and straight at the tip, comparable to great Indra's thunderbolt are (burning bright) like the sun. Looking like angry serpents, they will unfailingly strike at the miscreant Vali soon. 'These arrows covered with kanka feathers, sharp and straight at the tip, comparable to great Indra's thunderbolt are (burning bright) like the sun. Looking like angry serpents, they will unfailingly strike at the miscreant Vali soon. 'With these sharp, serpentlike arrows Vali will be killed. He will fall down on the ground like a mountain shattered.You will see it now'. Sugriva, very much pleased with the words of Rama, spoke highly (of him). 'O Rama, by your grace I will get my wife and kingdom back. O king accomplish this so that I can destroy my, elder brother, my enemy, O lion among men While Sugriva was making a friendly alliance with Rama, Sita's left eye, like lotus, Vali's left eye glittering like gold and Ravana's left eye blazing (like fire) twitched at the same time for a moment (Twitching of left eye is considered auspicious to a woman and ominous to a man).

While you were residing in the forest, a demon who was looking for an opportunity carried off your wife, the princess from Mithila, daughter of Janaka, finding her alone. While she was crying (piteously) he killed Jatayu. (the vulture who pretested). 'Very soon you will be relieved of the grief caused by the separation from your wife. Just as Visnu retrieved the Vedas (carried away by the demons, Madhu and Kaitabha) I will deliver her to you. 'O subduer of enemies I will restore her to you even if she is kept in the bowels of the earth or in the vaults of heaven. 'O longarmed Rama, take these words of mine as true. Your consort cannot be absorbed with impunity even by the denizens of heaven including Indra or the ogres on earth any more than food cooked with poison.Give up grief. 'O longarmed Rama, take these words of mine as true. Your consort cannot be absorbed with impunity even by the denizens of heaven including Indra or the ogres on earth any more than food cooked with poison.Give up grief. 'Yes, I remember. I had observed a lady being carried away by a wicked demon. She was crying loudly 'Oh, Rama Oh Rama Oh Lakshmana' in a husky voice. It was Maithili. She was wriggling on the lap of Ravana like a female serpent. 'Yes, I remember. I had observed a lady being carried away by a wicked demon. She was crying loudly 'Oh, Rama Oh Rama Oh Lakshmana' in a husky voice. It was Maithili. She was wriggling on the lap of Ravana like a female serpent. 'Seeing me as the fifth member seated on a mountain  she dropped down the auspicious ornaments (bundled) in her veil 'Rama, we have kept  them safely. I will fetch them so that you should be able to identify them.' Rama then said to Sugriva, one who used pleasing words, 'O my friend why delay? Get them here immediately'. On hearing this, Sugriva at once entered into the deep cave of the mountain (to get the ornaments and veil) in order to please Rama. That monkey brought out the veil and auspicios ornaments, showed them to Rama and said, 'Please, see.' Holding the raiment  as well as the ornaments,  Rama's  eyes were filled with tears.He appeared like the Moon covered with dews. On account of his deep attachment for Sita, he shed profuse tears. Unable to maintain his natural composure, he sank down to the ground, saying 'O my darling Sita' and cried inconsolably Pressing the excellent ornaments to his bosom again and again Rama hissed like a cobra provoked in its anthill. Rama began to wail piteously while tears streamed down his eyes incessantly. He looked at Saumitri standing by his side and said: 'O Lakshmana, behold the veil and the ornaments dropped on the ground by Vaidehi while she was being abducted. 'Sita, for sure, dropped these ornaments on the grassy ground. They are in good shape (without any damage). Thus addressed by Rama, Lakshmana replied, 'I recognise neither the armlets nor the earrings. I only recognise the anklets as I used to bow at her feet daily.' Then Rama said to Sugriva,.'Tell me, O Sugriva, to which region that fiercelooking demon has carried away my Sita, who is dearer than my life. Then Rama said to Sugriva,.'Tell me, O Sugriva, to which region that fiercelooking demon has carried away my Sita, who is dearer than my life. 'Let me know where dwells that huge  ogre who has caused this agony to me. I will exterminate all the demons 'By abducting Maithili he has stirred my fierce anger and has opened the door of his death. 'O lord of monkeys tell me the whereabouts of that nightranger who has carried off my darling from the heart of the forest and has harassed her. I will send him now to the abode of Death.       Thus ends the sixth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana,  the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the words of Rama in deep distress, the monkey replied to him with folded hands, his throat choked with tears: 'I do not have any knowledge of this sinful demon's dwelling , his capability, his valour or his clan or his despicable lineage. 'O subduer of enemies, give up sorrow. I promise I will make necessary effort so that you will obtain the princess from Mithila. 'With all my capability I will kill Ravana and his clan. Thus I will be able to satisfy you soon with my efforts. 'Give up despair. It is enough. Be patient. Maintain your natural disposition.It is unworthy of men like you to entertain such frivolus thoughts? 'Separated from my wife, I, too, am afflicted with deep grief. But I do not brood, I do not lose patience. 'I am an ordinary monkey born. Even then, I do not brood over my wife. You are highsouled, humble and patient. Why do you grieve? 'Restrain the flow of your tears. Be  patient. Men (like you) endowed with  equilibrium and dignity and patience ought not to leave their composure. 'In times of grief or loss of wealth or at the hour of death, one who is patient does not abandon his wisdom, he does not despair. A man who is unwise and distraught only gets sunk in grief like a heavily loaded boat (sinks) in water. 'I implore you with folded palms on account of our friendship to show manliness. You should not give in to grief. 'There is no happiness for those who give way to sorrow. Their brilliance is dimmed. Therefore, you ought not grieve. 'Even the chances of survival are doubtful for a man who is overpowered by sorrow. Give up sorrow and have patience, O king 'Out of friendly concern I offer my opinion in your interest. I am not competent to advise you. Respecting my friendship, you should never yield to grief.' Consoled by the sweet words of Sugriva, Rama wiped his face filled with tears by the hem of his upper cloth. When lord Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race was comforted by these words of Sugriva, he came to his senses, and clasping him said: 'O Sugriva you have done what a friend should have done in a befitting manner with your sweet words and good wishes. 'O friend you have guided me back to my senses thus. It is difficult to find a friend like you specially at this time. 'Indeed, you must make effort to trace the princess from Mithila and the evilminded, fierce  demon Ravana. 'Now tell me about my duty without any hesitation. I assure you that your desire will be fulfilled, just as seeds sown in a fertile land with timely rains bear fruit. 'O tiger amongst monkeys accept my words uttered out of injured honour in their true sense. 'I have never uttered a false word earlier nor will I do it in future. This is my promise. I swear by truth alone.' Sugriva and his counsellors felt glad on hearing Rama's words, particularly  the assurance given by him. Man and monkey then met privately and shared the weal and woe of one another. Wise Sugriva, chief of monkeys, heard the words of the magnanimous Rama, a bull among men. He felt glad at heart thinking that his task has been achieved.       Thus ends the seventh sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.",
                "Sugriva, the monkey was very pleased with Rama's words and said to him in front of Lakshmana: 'Since one like you endowed with all virtues has become my friend I am (now) worthy of grace of the gods in all respects. There is no doubt. 'O Rama, my sinless Lord, it is possible to attain even the kingdom of the gods with your help, what  to speak of my own kingdom? 'O Rama, since you, born in Raghava dynasty, have become my friend with fire as witness, I have become equally honourable among my relatives and friends. 'You will come to know slowly that I am also a friend worthy of you.It is not proper for me to speak of my qualities( flatter myself). 'The affection of exalted souls is exceedingly stable like the patience of  selfcontrolled and wellcomposed men like you. 'Good friends consider(valuables such as) silver or gold, clothes or ornaments of worldly wealth indivisible. 'Whether rich or poor, afflicted or happy, flawless or guilty, a friend is the ultimate refuge to a friend. 'One will not hesitate to sacrifice wealth or happiness or even life for the sake of a friend like you.' As wise Lakshmana, brilliant like Indra stood witness, Rama said, 'it is true as you say' to Sugriva who spoke pleasing words. With mighty Rama and Lakshmana standing by, Sugriva cast his eyes eagerly all round the forest. Then the chief of monkeys saw a sala tree looking lovely with tender leaves and flowers graced by bees. Sugriva cut a branch of the beautifully blossomed sala tree with plenty of leaves,   spread it (on the ground) and squatted along with Rama. Thereafter Hanuman also broke a branch of the sala tree and seated Lakshmana on it. Now Rama, seated comfortably on the best of mountains overgrown with trees full of flowers and fruits, appeared tranguil like an ocean. Extremely delighted and excited, Sugriva spoke to Rama words that got mixed up with softness and sweetness out of love: Now Rama, seated comfortably on the best of mountains overgrown with trees full of flowers and fruits, appeared tranguil like an ocean. Extremely delighted and excited, Sugriva spoke to Rama words that got mixed up with softness and sweetness out of love: 'I am sadly roaming here in the great Rishyamuka mountain, my wife stolen, offended by my brother and frightened. 'O Rama my brother is my enemy. Deceived and threatened by him, I live in the forest stricken with fear and utterly confused. 'O great warrior who can frighten all the worlds scared of Vali, I feel  helpless like an orphan to whom you ought to extend your grace.' Thus spoken to, the glorious Rama, lover of righteousness who knew his duty, replied to Sugriva with a smile on his face: 'While a friend is known for his help, an enemy is known for his offensiveness. I will this very day kill the one who wrested your wife. 'Here are my highspeed, winged arrows glowing like fierce fire, born out of Kartikeya's bed of reeds.They are smooth and welljointed, decked with gold, comparable in strength to great Indra's thunderbolt, very sharp with pointed tips looking like angry serpents. 'Here are my highspeed, winged arrows glowing like fierce fire, born out of Kartikeya's bed of reeds.They are smooth and welljointed, decked with gold, comparable in strength to great Indra's thunderbolt, very sharp with pointed tips looking like angry serpents. 'Vali who calls himself your brother is your enemy and a doer of wrong deeds. You will see him crushed, like a mountain shattered, by my arrows.' On hearing Rama's words, Sugriva, chief of the army of monkeys experienced immeasurable happiness and exclaimed, 'you're great, you're great.' 'Rama I am overwhelmed with sorrow. You are the refuge of the distressed. As you are a friend I ventilate all my grief to you. 'I value your hand of friendship extended to me, with fire as witness more than my very life. I, on my own, offer my pledge of friendship. His vision blurred, words choked with tears he was unable to speak further. Quickly Sugriva controlled his tears streaming fast like the rushing river, with patience, Rama seated in front. Effulgent Sugriva controlled his tears, wiped his bright eyes, took deep breath and said to Rama: 'O Rama I was subjected to the harsh words of powerful Vali in the past when he uprooted me from  the kingdom and threw me out. 'I was robbed of my wife who is dearer than my own life. All my friends were rounded up and imprisoned. 'O Rama this evilminded one made several attempts to kill me. The monkeys he sent to kill me were themselves killed. 'It is because of suspicion that I did not approach you. Every one is scared when there is ample reason to fear. 'Only Hanuman and other chiefs are helping me. Therefore, I am surviving in spite of all difficulties. 'These monkeys out of love for me keep me protected from all sides. They go out with me when it is necessary and stay back whenever I stop (in order to guard me). 'O Rama I tell you (my story) briefly. It is not necessary to go into details. My elder brother Vali, who is known for his prowess, is my enemy. 'My sorrow will go only with his death. My happiness and my life are also subject to his destruction. 'This what I had to tell you out of sorrow. This is how my sorrow will end. In joy and in sorrow your friend is your refuge. After hearing  Sugriva, Rama said 'I wish to know the actual cause of this enmity. 'On hearing the cause of your enmity and considering your strength and weakness, I will take steps to make you happy. 'On hearing about your humiliation I feel highly agitated at heart. I feel very much angry and restless like the water in rainy season. 'Tell me freely and cheerfully before I string the bow. Your enemy will be destroyed as soon as I release my arrow.' When the great Rama said this, Sugriva with all the four monkeys felt immeasurably glad. With a smile on his face, Sugriva started narrating to Lakshmana's elder brother the facts about the cause of his enmity (with Vali).       Thus ends the eighth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "'My elder brother called Vali, capable of exterminating enemies was always highly regarded by my father and me. 'I served him obediently like a servant while he ruled over the great  ancestral kingdom inherited by him. 'Dundubhi's eldest son Mayabi was a mighty demon. He developed bitter enmity with Vali for the sake of a woman. 'One midnight when all were asleep, he (Mayabi) came to the entrance of Kishkinda screaming angrily and bellowing at Vali, challenging him to a duel. ' My brother Vali, who was asleep could not tolerate the frightful sound and jumped out of bed hastily. 'Enraged, he came out to kill the powerful demon even though I with the womenfolk (of the harem) tried to prevent him. 'That mighty warrior(Vali) came out, pushing aside all the womenfolk. I too followed  him due to my affection towards him. 'On seeing my brother and me from a distance, the demon took to his heels scared. 'Frightened, he ran. We too chased him running faster. As the Moon was rising the path was welllit. 'The demon entered into a hole (cave) covered with a heap of grass, difficult, therefore, of access. Both of us reached there and took position. 'Seeing the enemy entering the cave, Vali became wrathful and his senses were terribly disturbed.He said to me: 'O Sugriva wait here at the entrance of the cave and be on your alert until I enter this hole and kill the enemy'. 'On hearing him, I begged the scorcher of enemies (Vali) that I would follow him, but he made me swear on his feet and entered the cave. 'Thinking him dead, I became agitated because of my love for him. My mind began to apprehend his death since I had not seen my brother for long. 'I heard the roaring voices of the demons and not the yelling of my brother engaged in the duel. 'O friend by those signs I understood that my brother was killed and concluding that way I blocked the entrance of the cave with a rock of the size of a mountain and offered oblations to my brother and came to Kishkinda. I intended to hide the fact of Vali's death. But the ministers came to know the truth with their efforts.

While I was ruling the kingdom lawfully, Vali, the monkey came back after killing the enemy demon. 'Seeing me on the throne, Vali became angry and his eyes turned red. He imprisoned my ministers and spoke to me harshly. 'O Rama even though I was capable of restraining the sinner, my intellect did not let me do so out of respect for my brother.

You are the only protector to an orphan which I am. 'Here is the manyribbed parasol shining like the full Moon above the horizon and the yak's tailfan held by me.Pray accept it.

'Even tnough I spoke to him with affection, Vali abused me in many words, saying, 'Fie on you'. 'Having invited ordinary people and favourite ministers he condemned me in the presence of friends. 'You know very well how that wicked demon, Mayabi, that night challenged me angrily to a duel. 'On hearing his words I came out of the royal abode quickly, followed by this wicked brother.

'When I saw the dreadful demon entering the great cave, I instructed this cruel brother of mine: 'I cannot return from here without killing him. Wait at the entrance of the cave until I kill him. Look forward to my return. 'Presuming that Sugriva was waiting there, I entered the formidable cave. While I was searching for the demon there, one year passed. 'I could find that fearful enemy there and killed him along with his relatives without any difficulty. 'When there was no response from Sugriva to my repeated call in distress I was very sad. 'I kicked the boulder again and again till it yielded. I came out that way and arrived at the city. 'I was obstructed by wicked Sugriva who forgot his brotherly love and was desiring  the kingdom, which belongs to me.' 'When Vali, the monkey, spoke that way I remained unperturbed. He banished me  with the only cloth I was wearing. 'O Rama my wife has been usurped. There is the fear of his attack. So I am roaming this entire earth, covered with forests and oceans. 'Tormented by the abduction of my wife by Vali, I came to the great Rishyamuka mountain  inaccessible to Vali for some other reason. 'O Rama I have given you this long, full account of the cause of our enmity. For no fault of mine I am suffering. 'O great warrior you are one who can frighten the entire world Due to the fear of Vali I seek your grace.You may resist Vali and provide me security.' Having thus addressed by Sugriva the righteous and glorious Rama with a gentle smile  consistent with righteousness, started speaking: 'These my sharp, unfailing arrows, bright as the Sun, released by me out of anger will descend on the evildoer, Vali. 'That sinful Vali who has abducted your wife and violated the moral code will live only as long I do not see him. 'Inferring from my own experience, I see that you are immersed in an ocean of sorrow.I will help you cross over and fulfil your desire.' On hearing his words that boosted his joy and vigour, Sugriva was immensely pleased and said these warm words.       Thus ends the tenth sarga of Kishkindhakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The words of Rama boosted Sugriva's joy and manliness. He offered him prayers and praise: 'There is no doubt that your sharp, blazing arrows will pierce through the vital parts of the body once you are angry, just as the Sungod burns all worlds at the end of the Yuga. 'In the early hours before Sunrise Vali crosses over the oceans from the west to the east and moving from south to north (performing sandhya) without getting fatigued. 'Climbing up speedily, valiant Vali would catch the huge mountain peaks. 'Vali would break several sturdy trees in the forest with his vigour and speed, exhibiting his strength. 'Massive like the shining peak of mount Kailas and valiant like the mightybuffalo in form, Dundubhi possessed the strength of a thousand elephants. 'Wicked Dundubhi of huge body was proud of his valour and deluded by virtue of the boons, went to the ocean, the lord of rivers. 'Reaching the mighty ocean, he implored the sea with (high) waves and hoards of gems for a fight. 'O king, then the powerful and righteous king of the ocean came out and spoke to the demon (Dundubhi) who was driven to death by fate.' 'You are proficient in warfare. I am not competent enough to challenge you to a duel. But  I will name the one who can. 'Himavan, the supreme abode of ascetics is the fatherinlaw of Lord Siva. He is wellknown as king of mountains, who has, waterfalls, caves, caverns and great forests.He is competent to match your incomparable love for war. 'Himavan, the supreme abode of ascetics is the fatherinlaw of Lord Siva. He is wellknown as king of mountains, who has, waterfalls, caves, caverns and great forests.He is competent to match your incomparable love for war.

He raised many huge white cliffs of the size of great elephants to the ground and roared. 'Dundubhi, the most powerful of demons, aware that the ocean is frightened of him went swiftly to Himavan like an arrow released from a bow. He raised many huge white cliffs of the size of great elephants to the ground and roared. 'Then the gentle Himavan of pleasing appearance stood in the form of a white cloud on the peak and spoke: 'Dundubhi, it is not proper for you to trouble me, for I am devoted to righteousness. I am the resort of ascetics and not adept in warfare'. \"At these words of Himavan, the wise king of mountains, Dundubhi whose eyes turned red in anger replied: 'If you are unable or unwilling to fight me out of fear, tell me who wants to challenge me to a duel. 'On hearing such words, which no one had spoken earlier, righteous Himavan, skilful in conversation, flew into a rage and said to Dundubhi,the best of demons: 'Vali, son of Indra, is a wise, powerful and prosperous monkey. He resides at Kishkinda, a city of incomparable glory. 'Vali is profoundly wise, an expert in warfare. He is capable of challenging you to a duel like Indra to Namuchi. 'If you wish to fight, go to him quickly.He is ever heroic and difficult to combat. 'Having heard Himavan, Dundubhi, seized with anger, went to Kishkindha,  the city of Vali. 'Mighty Dundubhi assuming the form of a frightening buffalo with pointed horns looking like a huge, dark raincloud in the sky in monsoon marched to the entrance of Kishkinda and roared like a wardrum as if shaking the earth. 'Mighty Dundubhi assuming the form of a frightening buffalo with pointed horns looking like a huge, dark raincloud in the sky in monsoon marched to the entrance of Kishkinda and roared like a wardrum as if shaking the earth. 'Dundubhi felled the trees nearby, rent the earth with its hoofs, scratched the entrance gate of the city as an elephant would do with its horns in arrogance. 'Unable to tolerate the sound, Vali jumped out of the harem along with the women like the Moon with stars. 'Vali, king of the monkeys who roam the forest, saw Dundubhi and addressed, but briefly: 'O Dundubhi why are you roaring, blocking the entrance of the city? I know you are powerful. Go and save your life.' 'Dundubhi whose eyes turned red in anger when he heard the words of Vali ,the wise king of the monkeys, said: 'O hero speaking such words in the presence of women is not proper. Come to me for a combat and I will let you know your strength. 'O monkey I will restrain my anger tonight and give you time for your indulgence in sensual pleasures till morning. 'O king of monkeys, hug them and give them any gift you want. Spend the night with your dear ones. 'Have a good look a Kishkinda. Assign some one like you kingship. Sport freely  with women and come, I shall destroy your arrogance. 'Whoever kills a person, who is drunk or is heedless or is asleep or without weapons or stupified by lust in this world, is equal to a killer of a foetus in the womb.' 'Then, Vali sent away Tara and all other women slowly and replied angrily to the foolish demon with a mischievous smile: 'Do not consider me drunken. This drink will serve as a warrior's drink in the combat. Be ready, if you are not afraid of a combat.' 'Having addressed thus in a rage, Vali removed the golden garland gifted by Indra, his father, and stood ready for the combat. 'Vali, the elephantlike monkey then held the mountainlike Dundubhi by the horns and struck him down, roaring loudly. 'Vali whirled him round and round and threw him downroaring. Blood flowed from Dundubhi's ears. 'Each one of them was highly agitated and angry trying to win over the other. A terrific fight took place between Dundubhi and Vali. 'Then Vali who was equal to Indra in prowess fought, hitting him with fists, knees, rocks and trees. 'Then as the monkey and demon fought pouncing on each other, the prowess of Dundubhi got diminished and that of Vali, the son of Indra, increased. In the fight, Dundubhi fell down, with his strength, courage and prowess dwindled. Vali lifted his huge body and dashed it down on the ground. The body of Dundubhi dissolved into the five elements. In the fight, Dundubhi fell down, with his strength, courage and prowess dwindled. Vali lifted his huge body and dashed it down on the ground. The body of Dundubhi dissolved into the five elements. 'Mighty Vali lifted on both shoulders the insensate body drained of life and hurled it speedily to a distance of a yojana. 'Scattered by the wind, drops of blood fell at the hermitage of Matanga from the mouth of the deadbody flung. 'The venerable sage became furious to see drops of blood fallen there. He started thinking who could he be? 'Who is that petty, wicked, evil minded one who caused the drops of blood to touch (fall on) me suddenly? 'The venerable sage came out of the hermitage and saw a mountaneous buffalo fallen dead on the floor. 'Having known through his ascetic vision that it was the act of a monkey, he pronounced a curse on Vali who had hurled (the body): 'Whoever has desecrated this forest, protected by me, with drops of blood is forbidden to enter this place. Once he does it, he will die. 'Whoever has broken the trees all over this forest and has thrown the demon's body will not survive if he enters within a radius of one yojana  of my hermitage. 'Indeed his counsellors who are here must leave this forest. Let them depart safely. 'If the monkeys stay back to destroy the leaves and shoots and plunder the fruits and roots of this forest which I have protected just like my son will also certainly invite my curse. 'If the monkeys stay back to destroy the leaves and shoots and plunder the fruits and roots of this forest which I have protected just like my son will also certainly invite my curse. 'I give one day's time for the monkeys (to leave). Whomsoever, I see tomorrow will get transformed into a mountain for many thousands of years' 'The monkeys fled on hearing the words spoken by the sage. Said Vali: 'Why have you, residents of the groves of Matanga, come to me? Hope all are safe' 'Then all the monkeys collected together and narrated everything about the curse given to Vali , adorned with a golden chain(on his neck). 'On hearing the monkeys, Vali went to the sage and begged forgiveness with folded hands. 'The sage went into the hermitage without obliging Vali who became apprehensive of the curse of the sage. 'O Lord Rama because of the fear of the curse, Vali will not enter the great Rishyamuka mountain nor will he like to see it. 'O Rama aware of the prohibition of Vali from entering the place, I roam about this great forest  accompanied by my ministers without any apprehension. 'Hurled with the pride of his(Vali's) prowess is this heap of bones of Dundubhi here, which shines like a huge mountain peak. 'Look at these seven sturdy Sala trees with branches  of one overlapping the other.  Vali was able to remove all the leaves of one Sala tree with just one arrow. 'O Rama Vali's strength and fame related by me is unequalled. O king how is it possible for you to kill him in a combat?' Smiling, Lakshmana asked Sugriva, 'By what action will you trust?. By the fulfilment of which task (by Rama) will you have faith?' Then Sugriva told Lakshmana that earlier Vali had split through these seven Sala trees one after the other, several times. 'If I see Rama splitting these trees with one arrow, I will believe he can kill Vali with his prowess. 'O Lakshmana and if Rama can also lift the dead buffalo's (Dundubhi's) skeleton and hurl it to a distance  of two hundred bows with one of his feet. Having said this and thinking for a moment, Sugriva again said to the heroic Rama whose eyes had turned red. 'Powerful Vali is valiant and has killed brave fighters. He is wellknown for his prowess and valour. He has not faced defeat in war. 'Even gods cannot do what he has done. Thinking of all this and being afraid of him, I have taken refuge at Rishyamuka. 'Thinking that this indignant, invincible lord of the monkeys, cannot be overpowered, I have not stepped out of Rishyamuka. 'I have discovered in you a faithful friend. O tiger among men, O venerable one, you are to me like the Himalayas. 'What to do? I know the strength of my mighty bad brother. But so far I have not seen your power in a battle. 'The dreadful acts of Vali have made me feel timid. This is not to compare you with him or your strength with his or insult you and scare you. 'Rama  your word and your courage indicate your supreme strength which is like fire covered with ashes.' Having heard the great Sugriva, Rama replied with a gentle smile: 'If you have no confidence in my strength in fight, O monkey, I will create it in you so much so that you will admire it.' Rama,the mighty elder brother of Lakshmana, having said so to Sugriva in a pleasing manner, lifted the dried body of Dundubhi easily with his toe, shook it and flung it with ease to a distance of ten yojanas. Rama,the mighty elder brother of Lakshmana, having said so to Sugriva in a pleasing manner, lifted the dried body of Dundubhi easily with his toe, shook it and flung it with ease to a distance of ten yojanas. Having seen Rama flinging the body, Sugriva said to him again in the presence of Lakshmanameaningfully: 'O friend, when Vali my brother flung the body, he was tired and intoxicated and the body was fresh with flesh (meaning heavy), but now, O Delight of the Raghu race, it is fleshless and light like a bunch of (dry) grass (for) which you could throw it playfully. 'O friend, when Vali my brother flung the body, he was tired and intoxicated and the body was fresh with flesh (meaning heavy), but now, O Delight of the Raghu race, it is fleshless and light like a bunch of (dry) grass (for) which you could throw it playfully. 'I was unable to gauge whether your strength is more  than his (Vali's) since there is a great difference between a dry body and a wet one. 'O Dear, therefore, I have my doubt about your relative strength. If you can split a sala tree with a single arrow then can your strength or weakness be demonstrated. 'Now string your bow, draw it like the trunk of an elephant up to your ear and release the great arrow. 'It will be enough and my doubt will be cleared. If you can pierce the sala tree with your arrow it will be my pleasure and not a test of your strength. 'Just as the Sun is the best among the brilliant, the Himalayas among the great mountains, the lion among the quadrupeds, so also you are the best among men of valour.'       Thus ends  the eleventh sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard Sugriva's pleasing words, the brilliant Rama took up the bow in order to inspire confidence in Sugriva. Rama, subduer of the enemy's pride, strung his terrific bow, produced the twang that filled all directions, and discharged a single arrow aimed at the sala tree. Released with great force, Rama's arrow embellished with gold pierced through the seven sala trees and splitting the mountain terrain entered the earth. In a moment the arrow emerged from the earth which it pierced and reentered the quiver with great speed. The chief of the monkeys was struck with wonder seeing Rama's arrow piercing through  the seven sala trees so swiftly. Sugriva was immensely happy and offered obeisance to Rama with folded hands and bowed down and prostrated while his ornaments touched the ground. Sugriva who stood by, elated to watch the deed of Rama, best among the valiant, proficient in the use of arms of all kinds and knower of dharma, said: 'O bull among men, O lord, you are capable of killing with your arrows even the gods including Indra in the battle, what to speak of Vali. 'O Rama who can in a battle confront you, capable of splitting seven huge sala trees, the mountain and the earth with a single arrow? 'Having found a friend in you comparable to Indra and Varuna, my grief is gone and I am so happy now. 'O Rama, for my pleasure kill Vali who is, to me, an enemy in the guise of a brother. I fold my hands to you. Then wise Rama embraced handsome Sugriva and replied in these words which were agreeable to Lakshmana: 'O Sugriva, get ready at once. We will promptly proceed to Kishkinda from here. Go ahead and challenge Vali, your brother only in name, to a combat.' Thay all rushed to Kishkinda, the capital of Vali and waited in the thick forest behind the trees. Sugriva tightened up his waist cloth hurriedly and roared terrifically as though piercing the sky. And screamed  for Vali. On hearing his brother roaring, powerful Vali was enraged and rushed like the Sun from behind the western shore of the ocean (this simile suggests the downfall of Vali). Then a tumultuous combat took place between Vali and Sugriva who looked like the planets Mercury and Mars. The brothers, insensate with fury, struck each other like thunder with their palms, soles  and fists in the combat. Bow in hand, Rama watched both the heroes who resembled the twin Aswini Kumaras. Since Rama was not able to distinguish between Vali and Sugriva, he could not decide whether he should discharge his deadly arrow . Discomfited  by Vali, and not seeing Rama around, Sugriva ran towards Rishyamuka mountain. Exhausted, disfigured and body mauled and drenched in blood all over, Sugriva, chased by the infuriated Vali, entered the region of  great sage Matanga. Effulgent Vali saw Sugriva entering the (prohibited) grove and turned back due to the fear of the curse (of sage Matanga) saying, 'You have escaped'. Rama together with Lakshmana and Hanuman also arrived at the same gave where  Sugriva was. At the sight of Rama accompanied by Lakshmana, Sugriva felt ashmed and aggrieved, and looking down on the ground, said: 'You demonstrated your prowess and directed me to challenge Vali and then why did you make the enemy hit me thus? 'Had you, in fact, told me that you were not going to kill Vali, I would not have budged from this place.' On hearing the great Sugriva's miserable and moving words, Rama again said: 'O dear Sugriva dispel your anger and listen to me why I had not released the arrow. 'O Sugriva in form, ornaments and movements there is perfect resemblance between you and Vali. 'O monkey in your voice, in brightness, in looks, in valour or in words I have marked no difference between you. 'O distinguished monkey you both are so similar in form that I was puzzled and did not release my swift arrow that could have destroyed the enemy. 'I was doubtful because of your similar appearance. I thought that I should not strike at the very root of the interests of both of us. Therefore, I did not release the terrific and deadly  arrow. 'O lord of monkeys I would have betrayed my foolishness and childishness had I exposed you to danger by my ignorance and thoughtlessness. 'It is said that killing a person to whom protection is promised is highly sinful. Lakshmana, darling Sita and me, are under your care and you are our refuge. 'Therefore, O monkey, go and engage yourself in fight again. Do not suspect me. With this single arrow of mine, in one moment you will see Vali thrown down and rolling on the ground in this combat. 'Therefore, O monkey, go and engage yourself in fight again. Do not suspect me. With this single arrow of mine, in one moment you will see Vali thrown down and rolling on the ground in this combat. 'O lord of monkeys while you both are engaged in a duel wear some identification mark by which I can recognise you. 'O Lakshmana this Gajapushpi  in bloom is auspicious. Pluck and fasten it on great Sugriva's neck.' Then Lakshmana went to the mountain slope, plucked the (creeper with) gajapuspi blossoms and fastened it on the neck of Sugriva. With the creeper round the neck, Sugriva looked like the raincloud at twilight, adorned by a row of cranes like a garland. Radiant Sugriva intent on carrying out Rama's words again went to Kishkinda ruled by Vali.       Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Lakshmana's righteous elder brother left Rishyamuka with Sugriva for Kishkinda protected by Vali's valour. Getting ready to go, Rama took up his great bow and arrows adorned with gold and potent in war looking (dazzling) like the Sun. The strongnecked Sugriva and mighty Lakshmana walked in front of the highsouled Rama. Brave and brilliant Hanuman, Nala, Nila, and Tara among the leaders of the monkeys  walked behind. They saw (on the way) trees bent down with the load of flowers, and rivers with pure water flowing into the sea. (They saw) beautiful valleys, mountains, caves, prominent peaks with deep caverns. Observing on the way delightful lotus buds with leaves like Vaidurya, clear water and full tanks (They moved on). Ducks, cranes, swans, vanjulas, waterfowls, chakravakas and other birds warbling melodiously. They observed deer feeding on tender grass on the ground around without fear, some standing and some roaming the forest Observing terrific elephants adorned with white tusks wandering alone destroying the tanks, shattering the banks. (Observing) intoxicated elephants knocking the edges of mountain slopes, elephants resembling (dark) rainbearing clouds, elephants like moving mountains, elephants with dust covered all over the body. Following Sugriva faithfully, they proceeded swiftly, observing animals of the forest and birds flying in the sky. While walking fast, looking at the forest full of trees Rama, the delight of the Raghus said to Sugriva: 'This cluster of trees surrounded by plantain groves look splendid like a vast collection of clouds in the sky. 'O friend I wish to know what this is? Could you answer my curiosity?' On hearing great Rama's words while walking in the extensive forest,  Sugriva started narrating: 'O Raghava this is a hermitage, enchanting with vast gardens and trees bearing sweet fruits, full of tasty roots and water that relieves tiresomeness (of travellers). 'These seven sages used to live on air and that too once in seven nights. They lived for seven hundred years performing penance with motionlessness and attained heaven along with their bodies. 'By virtue of the power of their penance, this hermitage surrounded by a row of trees is impenetrable even for demons and gods including Indra. 'Birds and wild animals avoid the hermitage and whoever enters there out of ignorance never returns. 'O Rama, one can hear pleasant sounds of jingling ornaments (of nymphs), of songs and windinstruments here. One can inhale divine fragrance, too. 'The three sacred fires keep burning and the thick smoke they emit resembles the red feet of  pigeons. It shines forth as if enveloping the treetops. 'These treetops covered with thick smoke glow like mountains of Vaidurya concealed by a cluster of clouds. 'O rigteous Rama you and your brother Lakshmana humbly offer obeisance to them(sacred hermitage and sages Saptajana) with folded hands and meditate on them. 'O Rama, nothing inauspicious happens to them who offer obeisance to those highly spiritual sacred sages.' Rama and Lakshmana  offered salutations with folded hands in memory of those great sages, great souls. Righteous Rama, Lakshmana, Sugriva and all the monkeys offered obeisance and proceeded delighted at heart. Walking a long distance from the hermitage of the seven seers, they beheld the unassailable Kishkinda ruled by Vali. Rama and Lakshmana of fierce lustre, and the monkeys took hold of the weapons to kill the enemy and reached the capital ruled by the valour of Vali, son of Indra.       Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "They all at once went to Kishkinda ruled by Vali and there waited hiding behind the trees in the dense forest. Broadnecked Sugriva, a lover of the forest, looked around and flew into a rage. Sugriva, surrounded by his companions, raised his voice as if piercing the sky, roaring like a huge thundering cloud, challenging Vali to a duel. Sugriva, proficient in the performance of any task, one who appeared like the rising Sun and moved like a proud lion, said to Rama: 'We have arrived at Kishkinda, the capital of Vali, decorated with flags and having a glittering golden archway that can be opened mechanically. Teeming with monkeys, it looks like a snare to catch the enemy. 'O heroic Rama fulfil quickly the vow taken by you earlier to kill Vali in the same way  a creeper bears fruit when the time comes.' Requested thus by Sugriva, righteous Rama, the destroyer of enemies, replied:. 'Lakshmana has uprooted a creeper of  gaja, and fastened it on your neck by which you can be easily identified. 'O hero, you are shining with the creeper fastened to your neck , just as the fullmoon adorned with a cluster of stars shines in the sky. 'O monkey, with the release of a single arrow in the combat, I shall dispel your fear and enmity (hatred) for Vali. 'O Sugriva show me your enemy,who is in the guise of your brother.He will be killed. He will roll down in the dust of the forest. 'If Vali appears before me I will not let him go with life.Then you will not blame me and find fault with me. 'You have seen how I have pierced through seven sala trees with a single arrow. You will know how with the same strength I will kill Vali.' 'O Sugriva, I have uttered no falsehood before for fear of deviation from righteousness although I was in distress, nor shall I utter any falsehood in any circumstances hereafter. 'I shall fulfil my promise just as Indra (who performed a hundred sacrifices) helps production in the cornfield through timely rain. Give up your apprehension. 'O Sugriva give a warcry so that Vali adorned with a golden garland will come out. 'Vali, who is proud of  his valour,  is strong, fearless and fond of combat, will rush out of the city in response to your challenge. 'Proud of their own prowess, heroes will not brook the challenge of foes in battle, specially in the presence of women.' On hearing Rama's words, the goldenhued Sugriva roared in a fierce voice as if it would piece  the sky. Alarmed at the yelling of Sugriva, the cows began to run in all directions, like the  women of noble pedigree who, with their brightness lost, run perplexed for failure of the king to protect their chastity. The deer were unable to run like wounded horses in a battle. Birds fell down on the ground like planets fall when their merit is exhausted. Then Sugriva, son of the Sungod, with his lustre enhanced by his valour moved swiftly. His roar resembled the rumbling of a cluster of thundering clouds. He gave a warcry the tone of which resembled the sounds of waves lashed by high velocity winds in the sea.       Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The indignant Vali, who was in the harem, heard the roaring of his venerable brother, Sugriva. The roar (of Sugriva) that frightened all beings gave Vali's vanity a jolt and at once   aroused in him violent rage. Overcome with anger, Vali looked pale like the eclipsed Sun with the golden radiance faded from  his face. Vali, who looked fierce with his teeth and whose eyes shone like a flaming fire through anger looked like a pond with the lotuses and their stalks uprooted. Unable to tolerate Sugriva's roar, Vali stepped out hurriedly, taking long strides as if breaking the earth. Tara, perplexed out of fear, glanced at Vali lovingly, embraced him and gave him wise counsel: 'O valiant Vali anger has overtaken you like the flood of a river. It is natural for you to be angry at this time, but shake off your anger just as the wise discard a flower  garland already used up. 'O monkey fight him only tomorrow morning. By this you are not going to prove your weakness or increase your respect for the enemy. 'I do not like your rashness. I will explain the reason I am preventing you. Listen: 'Earlier, he (Sugriva) came  and challenged you to a duel. You struck him in anger, and defeated, he fled, running in all directions. Now his challenge rouses my suspicion. 'One who is defeated and badly mauled by you is again coming and inviting you to a duel in this manner arouses suspicion in me. 'His determination, his insolence, his roaring, his arroganceall this cannot be for a small reason. 'Certainly Sugriva has not come here to give a warcry without any external help. The person whose refuge he has sought is not a small one. 'Sugriva is clever by nature. He is wise. Without assessing the ability of the ally he will not enter into friendship. 'O hero I have heard the news earlier from our son Angada. I will tell you what he had heard and what he has said to me: 'When our son Angada was out into the forest he had collected some reports from the spies which he has transmitted to me. 'Rama and Lakshmana, two heroic sons of the king of Ayodhya born of the Ikshvaku race, are invincible in war. They have come there to help Sugriva. 'Rama, famous for crushing foes in war, like the fire that breaks out at the dissolution of the world, has slain strong enemies like Khara and will help your brother. 'He is like a sheltering tree to the virtuous, an ultimate refuge for the destitutes and a protector of the distressed. He is the sole repository of fame. 'He is endowed with the knowledge of science and scriptures. He stood by his father's command. He is like a mine of virtues just as the lord of the mountain is  a mine of minerals. 'Rama is immeasurable in prowess and unconquerable in war. Therefore, enmity with him is not desirable for you. 'O hero, this I tell you not because I dislike you, but because I wish your welfare. Listen, and do as I say 'O king O hero consecrate your brother Sugriva as prince at once. Do not create enmity with him. 'Leave enmity with Sugriva far behind. Make friendship with Rama. I think it is the right thing for you. 'This monkey is your younger brother and, therefore, deserves your protection. Whether he is here or there, he is your brother. 'Indeed I do not see any of your relatives comparable to him on earth. Give up enmity with him. Give him wealth. Give him respect. Keep him by your side. 'Indeed I do not see any of your relatives comparable to him on earth. Give up enmity with him. Give him wealth. Give him respect. Keep him by your side. 'Extend your brotherly affection to broadnecked Sugriva. He is always your great relation. There is no alternative for you other than this at present. 'Pray, do me this favour. Treat me as your wellwisher. Heed my  advice given with care. 'Do not lose your temper. Quieten your mind. My advice is beneficial to you. You should not  fight with the prince of Kosala who is comparable to Indra in splendour.It is not proper for you.' Even though Tara gave good counsel to Vali at the hour of destruction, the advice did not find favour with him as he was under the influence of unfavourable time (seized by death).       Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "To these words of Tara with her Moonlike face, Vali replied reproachfully: 'O lady with a charming face why should I tolerate the enemy (Sugriva) who is none other than my own younger brother, especially when he roars excitedly? O timid lady to swallow insult (without facing the opponent) is worse than death for indomitable heroes (like me) who know no retreat in a battle. 'When the weaknecked Sugriva roars eager to join a duel it is not right on my part to tolerate his arrogance,much less his warcry. 'You need not be concerned about me on account of Rama. How can one who knows dharma and who has a sense of gratitude commit sin? 'Go back with all the women of the harem. Why do you follow me again? Your devotion towards me is evident from the sincere concern expressed by you. 'I shall accept the challenge and fight with Sugriva. Give up your anxiety. I will destroy  his pride, not his life. 'When he faces me in the battlefield, I will hit him with trees and fists, and he will run back  for life. 'That evilminded Sugriva cannot bear my mighty, hard blows. Tara you could shower your affection on me and extend help (in passing secret information obtained through Angada) 'I make a vow even on my life and my victory. Pray return with the retinue. I will be back only after winning the encounter with my brother. Pleasing in her words, Tara then embraced Vali and sobbing, circumambulated Vali in compliance (to his advice). The wise counsellor, Tara bade him farewell, wishing him victory and then, overwhelmed with sorrow, entered the inner apartment followed by the womenfolk. After Tara and other women returned to their abode, Vali departed from the city,  hissing  like a huge angry cobra. The mighty Vali, breathing heavily, looked around to find where his enemy was. There Vali saw Sugriva in lustrous, red gold complexion standing ready for a combat steady like glowing fire. On seeing the great hero Sugriva standing firmly, the enraged Vali tied his upper cloth (around his loin) tightly. Vali tied up his cloth tightly, raised his fist and advanced towards Sugriva, ready for the encounter. Sugriva also lifted his fist firmly and advanced more impatiently towards Vali adorned with a golden necklace. While Sugriva, expert in combat, advanced swiftly to pounce upon (his enemy), Vali whose eyes turned red in anger said: This infuriated Sugriva who, looking at Vali, said 'This fist of mine will draw your life out, hitting your forehead'. Struck by Vali, enraged Sugriva encountered Vali more aggresively. His body drenched in blood seemed a mountain with rivulets of blood flowing. With all his vigour, Sugriva uprooted a sala tree, pulled it out and struck Vali on the body, like a thunderbolt striking a huge mountain. Struck by the blows of the sala tree, Vali also lost his balance like the heavily loaded ship of a trader shaken up in the ocean. Both of them endowed with terrible strength, fierce in appearance, and each seeking the weak points of the other advanced, as fast as Garuda, striking at the enemy. Their fight grew more and more fierce like the fight between Sun and Moon in the sky. In a short while Vali, endowed with great strength, gained the upper hand and Sugriva, son of the Sungod, was losing ground . With his strength waning and pride crushed, Sugriva, anguished, exhibited shrewdness. Both like Vritra and Indra fought, hitting each other again and again with trees full of branches and tops, with their hard nails akin to thunderbolts and with their fists, knees, feet, etc. Both like Vritra and Indra fought, hitting each other again and again with trees full of branches and tops, with their hard nails akin to thunderbolts and with their fists, knees, feet, etc. The monkeys, wanderers in the forest, both with blood stains fiercely clashed pointing at each other, roaring with dreadful sounds like two clouds. Raghava perceived that the monkey king Sugriva whose strength was waning was looking again and again in all directions (seeking help). Finding the king of the monkeys in distress, the heroic, brilliant Rama looked for an  arrow in order to kill Vali. Rama then fixed an arrow which resembled a venomous snake, on to his bow looking like the very deathwheel of Yama and stretched it fully. As if scared by the twang of the bowstring, winged and feathered birds and animals ran frightened in different directions. As Rama shot the mighty arrow, it went like a blazing lightning with a thunderous sound and pierced into the chest of Vali. Then the powerful monkey king Vali, who was proud of his might, fell down on earth, struck by the fast flying arrow. Vali fell lustreless on the ground. He was thrown down unconscious like the banner (hoisted in honour) of Indra on the fullmoon day of Aswayuja month. The arrow of Rama, distinguished among men, adorned with silver and gold, which could crush the enemy shone like fire and smoke emitted from the mouth of Rudra at the time of dissolution (at the end of the aeon).",
                "A tyrant in war, Vali struck by4.54.24 Rama's arrow, collapsed instantaneously like a tree felled down. Adorned with shining gold ornaments,Vali fell down with all his limbs touching the ground like Indra's flag when its ropes are loosened. When the lord of the monkey troops fell down, it was as though the earth lost its brightness like the sky loses its brightness devoid of the Moon. Even though the highsouled Vali's body had fallen on the ground, its  splendour, glow, life and valour had not left it. As the most beautiful golden necklace, studded with diamonds, given by Indra was there on him, the life, brightness and splendour of Vali's body remained. Vali, the chief hero of the monkeys, with his golden necklace appeared like the raincloud hallowed by the glowing twilight. Even though he had fallen down, the effulgence of his necklace on his body, and the arrow pierced into his vital parts remained. Rama's arrow released paved the way to heaven which was that hero's supreme destination. Rama followed by Lakshmana slowly approached the longarmed, lionchested, brightfaced, tawnyeyed Vali, and admiringly observed this unchallengeable son of Indra, unassailable like Indra himself. Adorned with a golden necklace, he had fallen on the ground like fire without flame, like king Yayati descended on the earth from the celestial realm on the exhaustion of his merits, or like the Sun cast down on the earth at the end of the aeon.

On seeing powerful Rama and Lakshmana approaching,Vali spoke with pride and rigteousness to Rama, 'You are a prince, born of a noble family, son of a renowned king. You are famous, brilliant, handsome and follower of good practices.Having hit me when I was engaged otherwise in an encounter what merit have you gained?'

'O king selfcontrol (of organs of action and sense organs), righteousness, steadfastness, truthfulness, valiance and capacity to punish the offenders are virtues  of a king. 'Believing that you are a repository of all these virtues are in you, and respecting your noble lineage I engaged in a duel with Sugriva even though I was forewarned (by Tara). 'I did not know that you have killed your soul (by acting against your conscience), that you are sinful in conduct and unrighteous under the show of virtues like a well, its mouth covered with grass. 'You are a sinful man covered with the mask of piety thus resembling a hidden fire. I failed to recognise that righteousness is a mere pretext for you. 'I did no harm to your affairs or to your city. I did not insult you. Why did you choose to kill me, a monkey roaming in the forest and living on fruits and roots? I was not fighting you. Why did you come and strike a person like me? 'I did no harm to your affairs or to your city. I did not insult you. Why did you choose to kill me, a monkey roaming in the forest and living on fruits and roots? I was not fighting you. Why did you come and strike a person like me? 'O prince, you are son to a king, handsome and famous. Even signs of righteousness are discernible in you. 'Who, born in a kshatriya family, versed in the Vedas and free from doubt will commit such a cruel act under the guise of righteousness? 'You are born in a royal family. You are wellknown. You are proficient in dharma. Yet you are unworthy  of your race and robe. 'Conciliation, generosity, forbearance, righteousness, truthfulness, steadfastness in valour and punishing offenders are the hallmarks of rulers. 'O Rama we are mere animals wandering in the forest and living on roots and fruits. This is our nature. (But) you are a lord of men. 'We fight for land or gold or silver. What did you fight me for, for what I have or for the fruits of the forest? 'Submissiveness and modesty are the attributes of good rulers and should not be mixed up with benevolence and selfrestraint. Kings ought not to act (as they like) impulsively. 'Fulfilling your own desire is important for you. You are wrathful and unstable with royal course of conduct. Your business is with your bow and arrows. 'O lord of men you have no faith in righteousness, no steadfastness in the acquisition of wealth. You have no control over the senses. You are overcome by delusion. 'O scion of the Kakutsthas Having killed me here with your arrow even though I have done you no harm, you have perpetrated an abominable act. How will you defend yourself in the midst of holy men after commiting such a sinful act? 'One who kills a king, a brahmin or a cow, a thief or one who delights in destruction of life an atheist or one who marries before his elder  they all go to hell. 'My skin is not fit to be worn by the virtuous, my hair and bones are also prohibited from any use. My flesh is also not at all fit to be eaten by righteous people like you 'O Rama brahmins and kshatriyas are permitted to eat only the five nailed animals the porcupine, the hedgehog, the alligator, the rabbit and the tortoise. 'O king the learned do not even touch my skin or bone. They do not eat my flesh. While it is so, you have unnecessarily killed me, a fivenailed animal. 'Tara knew everything. Her words were correct. They were meant for my wellbeing. However, due to my ignorance (or arrogance), I did not heed her words and fell under the sway of the lord of death 'O Kakutstha just as a wife endowed with good character cannot be protected by a wicked husband, you cannot be a protector of this earth. 'You are treacherous, dishonest, mean, guised with false humility and a sinner to the core. How were you born to that highsouled Dasaratha? 'Breaking through the chains of good character, trespassing the moral code of conduct of the sages, discharging the sharp arrow of righteousness, the elephantine (arrogant) Rama killed me. 'You have committed an inauspicious, improper act, despised by the virtuous. What will you speak when you are questioned by noble men for committing such an act? 'O king you have exhibited your valour against one who has done you no harm. Why have you not shown such valour on those who have offended you? 'O prince had  you fought me face to face you would have seen Vaivasvata, the lord of death today (you would have been killed by me). bitten to death by a snake while fast asleep. 'Had you sought my help earlier(before you met Sugriva), I would have restored Sita to you within a single day. I have been killed by you to oblige Sugriva. I would have handed over Ravana by the neck after killing him in the battle. 'Had you sought my help earlier(before you met Sugriva), I would have restored Sita to you within a single day. I have been killed by you to oblige Sugriva. I would have handed over Ravana by the neck after killing him in the battle. 'Even if she were hidden in the waters of the ocean or in the underworld, I would have brought her by your order like Sweta to Aswatari or Hayagriva. (Hayagriva, an incarnation of Visnu brought Vedas stolen by demons, Madhu and Kaitabha from Patala or the netherworld) 'Sugriva inheriting the kingdom after my departure to heaven is proper. But your killing me this way in the combat by unjustifiable means is not. 'Indeed, in the world people meet with death when the time comes. Hiding yourself (from me) you have achieved it. Is it proper for you? You may think over and give your reply.'",
                "To these harsh words though seemingly wellmeaning, courteous and righteous, Vali who had been mortally wounded and confused in mind, Rama replied: To righteous Vali,the best of the monkeys, the lord of the monkeys, who looked like the Sun shorn of his brilliance or a raindrained cloud or a fire that had been extinguished. Rama, under the scanner, said in reply: To righteous Vali,the best of the monkeys, the lord of the monkeys, who looked like the Sun shorn of his brilliance or a raindrained cloud or a fire that had been extinguished. Rama, under the scanner, said in reply: 'Without correct knowledge of dharma, artha, kama and worldly ways, how do you reproach me bitterly now in total ignorance? 'O gentle Vali why do you speak with monkeyish frivolousness, without consulting the elders and teachers endowed with intelligence? 'This earth including mountains, groves and forests, animals, birds and humans belongs to the Ikshvaku kings.The right of purnishment and reward also vests with them. 'Bharata, righteous, truthful, upright, knower of dharma, artha and kama and dispenser of punishment and rewards, rules this earth. 'Bharata in whom justice and discipline, truth and courage along with the knowledge of time and place for action are firmly rooted is king (of this earth). 'Following his command, in confirmity with dharma we and the other kings also move all over the  entire world desirous of promoting dharma. 'Who can stray from the path of dharma when the whole world is ruled by Bharata, a tiger among kings, and a lover of dharma? 'By the command of Bharata ,all of us are devoted to our duty of upholding dharma and virtue and duly punish those who deviate from the path of dharma. 'You have violated dharma. You stand condemned for your actions. Passion is your priority. You have strayed from the right path of kings. 'O monkey dharma is very subtle. It is extremely difficult to understand. Installed in the hearts of all living beings the self knows good and evil (soul is the witness of good and evil). 'You are fickle by nature. Your consultants are frivolous, pettyminded monkeys. It is like one born blind suppporting another blind by birth. What do you know (about dharma)? 'I shall explain to you clearly (the reason for striking you down). It is not proper for you to despise me with mere anger and malice. 'Now know the reason why I struck you down. Having abandoned the eternal  law, you are living with your younger brother's wife. 'You are a sinner, since you live with Ruma, who is your virtual daughterinlaw, when the great self Sugriva is alive. (A younger brother is like a son and his wife, a daughterinlaw). 'O monkey since you have violated morality by sinning against your brother's wife this punishment is justified. 'O lord of monkeys I do not see any other way of controlling a person excepting punishing the one who has acted against dharma and swerved from the accepted code of conduct. 'I am a kshatriya born of a good family. I will not pardon you for your sin. Whosoever transgresses dharma against his own daughter, sister or brother's wife out of lust should be killed according to smriti. 'Bharata is a king and we follow his command. How can you, who have strayed from dharma, go unpunished? 'Wise Bharata being a respectable king rules by dharma. By the command of Bharata, we are bent upon punishing those who have strayed from dharma  by being addicted to sensual pleasures. 'O Vali we have to follow Bharata's command and are bent upon punishing those wicked people who deviate from the bounds of dharma. 'My friendship with Sugriva is as strong as that with Lakshmana. Its motive is the recovery of his wife and sovereignty. I have  promised this to him in the presence of monkeys. How can a pledge remain unhonoured by a person like me? How is it possible? 'My friendship with Sugriva is as strong as that with Lakshmana. Its motive is the recovery of his wife and sovereignty. I have  promised this to him in the presence of monkeys. How can a pledge remain unhonoured by a person like me? How is it possible? 'Knowing all these reasons(many violations of dharma), it is proper for you as a king to approve of the punishment accorded to you in consonance with dharma. 'Punishment given to you should be viewed as a right course of action in all respects. This is the duty of a trustworthy friend who follows dharma. 'You should also have acted in that manner considering dharma. Now listen to what Manu said, in two verses that hold good traditions dear which are accepted by men wellversed in dharma. O monkey the action taken by me is in conformity with this. 'You should also have acted in that manner considering dharma. Now listen to what Manu said, in two verses that hold good traditions dear which are accepted by men wellversed in dharma. O monkey the action taken by me is in conformity with this. 'Men who have perpetrated sins should be subjected to punishment by kings so that they become stainless and attain heaven like pious men who have performed good deeds. 'In the past a similar sin was perpetrated by Sramana, a revered soul (mendicant) and Mandhata, a noble king of my race inflicted terrible punishment on him. 'Vicious deeds have been committed by others when the kings were not watchful. Kings punish such sinners when they are vigilant. Otherwise they have to atone for their negligence. 'O tiger among monkeys do not regret. Your death has the sanction of dharma. We are under the control of sastras. We are committed to them. We do not have the freedom to act independently. 'O hero O best of monkeys listen to me. I will give you one more reason. On hearing it, I hope you would not be angry with me. 'O best of monkeys I have no mental agony nor do I regret in this case. Hidden from view or out in the open, people catch animals by means of snares or ropes or through other tricks. 'People seeking animal flesh for food kill animals alarmed or unalarmed, animals that run away or animals that stand still. They kill animals whether they are alert or not and no blemish is attached. 'People seeking animal flesh for food kill animals alarmed or unalarmed, animals that run away or animals that stand still. They kill animals whether they are alert or not and no blemish is attached. 'O monkey even royal saints wellversed in dharma go for hunting. I struck you down with an arrow whether you were fighting with Sugriva or not, since you are a monkey. (You can be hit whether you are fighting face to face or not). 'O best of monkeys kings are donors of dharma, life and auspiciousness to people which is difficult to acquire. There is no doubt about it. 'One should not insult kings, nor shout at them, nor disregard them nor speak unpleasant words to them. They are gods in human form moving on this earth. 'Seized with improper anger, you are reproaching one who is devoted to dharma, without knowing that I follow the code of conduct that has been passed on by my fathers and forefathers.' Vali was very much pained to hear Rama. He became free from confusion regarding dharma and no longer found fault with Rama. Thereafter Vali offered obeisance with folded palms to Rama, saying, 'O best among men whatever you have spoken is undoubtedly true.' In Progress 'You are a wise man given to truth and righteousness.You remain devoted to people's wellbeing. As you know for certain about cause and effect your intellect is sound and words pleasant. 'O knower of dharma, I did not follow dharma in the past. I have trangressed the bounds of dharma. Say, you have pardoned me, protect me in a righteous manner. 'I neither grieve for myself nor for Tara nor for my kinsmen. But I do for my son Angada adorned with golden armlets. He is embellished with all virtues. 'I loved him very much from his childhood. He will grow depressed in my absence. He will become like a pond whose waters have been dried up. 'O Rama he is my only son through Tara and dear to me. He is young,innocent but strong.He  deserves to be protected by you. 'Shower equal affection from your heart on Sugriva and Angada. You are their protector and punisher also. You know what should and should not be done. 'O lord of men may you have the same kind of affection for Sugriva and Angada as you have for Bharata and Lakshmana. 'I hope Tara will not be made to suffer because of my offence. Make Sugriva not to run wretched Tara down. 'It is possible for a person favoured by you to rule the kingdom.It is possible for one who is under your control and acts according to your will to rule the entire world and earn heaven. 'It is possible for a person favoured by you to rule the kingdom.It is possible for one who is under your control and acts according to your will to rule the entire world and earn heaven. 'Even though I was prevented by Tara, I came for a duel with Sugriva since I wished to die in your hands.' Having spoken thus to Rama, Vali fell silent. Now Vali was able to see clearly. Rama consoled him with words of peace and tranquillity, truth and righteousness. 'O best of monkeys, abandon all your anxiety on this score. Bother not about us or about yourself. Whatever has happened, has happened in consonance with dharma. 'O best of monkeys, abandon all your anxiety on this score. Bother not about us or about yourself. Whatever has happened, has happened in consonance with dharma. 'The sinner and the punisher, whoever gives punishment and whoever receives it, are both regulated by the law of cause and effect. So do not despair. 'You have been purged of your sin through punishment from the point of view of righteousness. You have regained your spiritual nature on the path of dharma. 'O best of monkeys remove sorrow from your heart, delusion and fear. It is not possible for you to transgress fate. 'O lord of monkeys Angada will remain with Sugriva and with me as he used to live with you. Rest assured.' Having listened to the sweet, wellcomposed words of great Rama, a crusher of the enemy in war ,follower of righteous path, Vali replied in appropriate manner: 'Pray, O mighty prince, hero of immense valour, pardon me for the words of blame I unwittingly hurled at you. I said all that in excruciating pain caused by your mighty arrow and in confusion of what is right and what is wrong.'       Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The king of monkeys lying on the ground struck by the arrow did not offer to reply after listening to Rama's appropriate answers (to his objections). Severely battered by stones, hit by trees and pierced by Rama's arrow, Vali lost consciousness as the end of his life was nearing. Tara, wife of Vali, heard that her husband, tiger among monkeys, was killed in the battle by the arrow discharged by Rama. Hearing the terrible, unhappy news of her husband's death, Tara anxiously rushed along with her son out of the mountain cave. Alarmed at the sight of Rama holding the bow, the terribly courageous monkeys who followed Angada as his bodyguards ran in different directions. Tara saw the terrorstricken monkeys running helterskelter, like the herd of deer whose leader who had strayed had been killed. Sorrowful Tara, the wife of Vali, duly approaching the monkeys stricken with grief and running as if chased by the arrows of Rama at their back, said to them: 'O monkeys deserting the lion among kings,whose servants you are ? What should you  be frightened for ? Why run away in distress? 'If the (elder) brother is struck down by his (younger) brother in anger for the sake of kingship using farreaching arrows discharged by Rama, why are you running?' On hearing Tara, the wife of Vali, the monkeys who could assume any form at their will replied with clear words appropriate to the occasion: 'O mother, your son is still alive. Go back and protect your son Angada. Lord of death in the form of Rama has come and killed Vali and is carrying him away. 'Rama smashed the trees and stones Vali hurled at him and then struck him down with thunderboltlike arrows. 'When Vali who was equal to Indra in strength, a tiger among monkeys, was killed, the army of monkeys got terrified and ran away here and there, scattered in different directions. 'Let the gate of the city be shut and Vali's son be consecrated as king. All the monkeys will serve him when he assumes power. 'O lovely Tara, this very day other monkeys will soon occupy our citadels. 'There are monkeys wandering in the forest (sent away by Vali). Some of them have made others' wives their own and some have been separated from their wives. They are a great cause of fear.' Hearing the words of the pettyminded monkeys, Tara spoke to them in her own way with a gentle smile: 'Now that the glorious Vali, a lion among monkeys, my husband is dying, of what purpose is the son, or the kingdom or my own life? 'I will seek the soles of the feet of the great soul who has been killed by the arrow discharged by Rama.' So saying, the griefstricken, weeping Tara hastened, sadly beating with both hands her head and her chest. As she was nearing (the spot) she saw her husband, a great conqueror of monkeys who never retreated  from the battle, mortally hit and fallen on the ground. Vali who used to hurl huge mountains like Indra discharges thunderbolts, who had the speed  of wind of high velocity, who would roar like huge thundering clouds, (Vali) who was equal to Indra in prowess looked like a huge monsoon cloud that had calmed down after pouring all water, a roaring warrior who could frighten others,  struck down by another warrior,  appeared like a lion killed by a tiger for the sake of meat Vali looked like a chaitya (a tree of worship) having a banner and altar and reverentially  worshipped by the entire world, but destroyed by Garuda on account of a serpent (hidden in it). (Here Rama is Garuda, Sugriva, serpent and Vali a sacred Chaitya) The auspicious lady Tara beheld Rama standing there firmly with his brother and Sugriva, leaning on the best of bows. Passing Rama and Lakshmana, she went near her husband killed in the combat. She was full of agony to see him. Deeply agitated in the mind, she fell down on the ground. Tara got up again, as if she woke up from sleep and addressing her husband garlanded with death, lamented. Seeing Tara crying like a female osprey and Angada following her in despair, Sugriva felt pain (at heart).       Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Beholding her husband lying on the ground pierced by a deathdealing arrow released by Rama, the lovely moonfaced Tara went and embraced him. Beholding Vali, the lord of monkeys, who was strong as an elephant, splendid as a mountain, fallen down like an uprooted tree, struck by the arrow, Tara became restless and wailed bitterly: Beholding Vali, the lord of monkeys, who was strong as an elephant, splendid as a mountain, fallen down like an uprooted tree, struck by the arrow, Tara became restless and wailed bitterly: 'O valiant hero, lord of monkeys you were terrifying in war. Why don't you speak now to me so forlorn and helpless? 'O tiger among monkeys get up. Come and sleep on the best of beds. Best of kings, you should not lie on the ground. 'O lord of the earth I know you loved the earth more than you loved me since you have forsaken me and enjoy her company by hugging her with your limbs, even after death. 'O my heroic husband, you are the legitimate, righteous king of Kiskinda. You have evidently built another beautiful city Kiskinda on your way to heaven. 'Our pleasure trips to sweetscented forests have ended now. You have brought them to a close. 'You are the leader of leaders. Now that you have attained heaven I am bereft of all joy,   plunged in a sea of grief. 'I presume my heart is strong, for it has not broken into a thousand pieces, even though I am overwhelmed with grief to see my husband fallen on the ground. 'O king of monkeys you have banished Sugriva. You have usurped his wife. This is the fruit  of your action. 'O lord of monkeys wishing your wellbeing I tendered salutary advice. But out of delusion you despised them. 'O venerable one you will surely churn the minds of the kindhearted celestial nymphs who are endowed with youth and beauty. 'No doubt time is inexorable. The time of your death had surely arrived.Now you, whom nobody could control, have come under the sway of Sugriva. 'I have not experienced poverty or suffering before. Immersed in grief, like an orphan, now I am reduced to the pitiable condition of a widow. 'To what plight will the tender Angada, who has been tended affectionately and deserves comforts, be reduced when his uncle displays anger? (Turning to Angada Tara said) 'O son, look at your father, a lover of dharma. See him, as it will be difficult to see him later, dear'. 'O lord you have set out on a long journey. Kiss your son on the forehead, enjoy its sweet smell, console him and give him your message. 'Indeed, Rama has achieved a great feat in fulfilling his promise to Sugriva. He is acquitted of the debt by killing you. '(Now turning to Sugriva she said) O Sugriva your enemy brother has been killed and your desire has been fulfilled.You will get back Ruma and enjoy the kingdom without any obstacles.' '(To Vali she said) O lord of monkeys Why don't you speak to me loving words when I am wailing this way? Here are your excellent wives' On hearing the wailing of Tara, all the other wives of Vali held the piteous (in their arms) Angada and wailed, overwhelmed with sorrow: 'O hero, adorned with armlets, why have you departed on a long journey, deserting your dear son Angada who possesses similar virtues like you? It is not proper. 'O darling, attractively dressed, you are leaving me and Angada and going too far.  What unpleasant deeds we have done (to deserve this). 'O longarmed chief of the monkey clan O warrior pardon me any wrong done unknowingly, inconsiderately. I touch your feet with my head.'",
                "Thereafter Hanuman, leader of the monkey clan, slowly consoled Tara who was (standing before her husband) like a star fallen from the sky. 'On departing from this mortal world an embodied soul reaps gradually the good and evil fruits of action performed under the notion of virtue or vice with an eye to their good or evil consequences. 'For whom do you grieve except for yourself? You are miserable. Who are you sympathising with? Who are you grieving for? When this body itself  is like a bubble, who is worth grieving for? 'You are mother of a surviving son, Angada. You have to look after him in times to come. Think of the duties to be performed now. 'You are aware of the uncertain and transient happenings in the lives of living beings. Therefore, a wise lady should do auspicious work in this world. 'Tens of millions of monkeys depended on this hero with their hopes on him. He has reached his ultimate destiny now to enjoy the fruits of his good deeds. 'This hero with a right vision, adopted the means of conciliation, charity and forgiveness (in his administration) and has finally reached a position through righteousness in his death. It is not proper to mourn for him. 'O blemishless lady these great monkeys including your son Angada and the entire kingdom of monkeys and bears are under your protection. 'O fair sex Encourage these two griefstricken heroes (Angada and Sugriva) gently. Let Angada rule this earth under your protection. 'Let all the rituals of the king of vanaras be performed. Let Angada be consecrated. You will attain peace of mind to see your son seated on the throne.' On hearing Hanuman's words, Tara, tormented by the death of her husband said to Hanuman who was waiting for her reply: 'To embrace even the deadbody of this hero is better than (to embrace) a hundred prototypes of Angada. 'O Hanuman the best of monkeys, you need not think about (the future of) Angada. A father plans for a son and not (even) the mother. There is nothing more befitting for me than joining the king of monkeys either here or in the next world. It is proper for me to resort to this resting place (pyre) used by this slain hero in front of me.       Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Vali, gazing all around, breathing slowly and sighing feably beheld Sugriva at first instance, Sugriva who was standing in front of his own son. Vali, the lord of monkeys, lovingly said to Sugriva, who had won a victory: 'O Sugriva you ought not to accuse me of exiling you, and wresting your wife. My mind was deluded by the force of fate that controls one's future. 'O dear I believe that both of us are not destined to enjoy the love and happiness that come together to brothers. 'I am leaving this world soon, along with this vast kingdom, prosperity and untarnished fame. 'O warrior king you should do whatever I request you at this hour even though it may not be easy. 'Look at this young Angada fallen on the ground, face flooded with tears. Raised with comfort, he deserves to be kept happy. 'He is dearer to me than my life. Take care of him like your own son. He is separated from me. Take care of him in all respects, so that he is not deprived of anything. 'O lord of monkeys from now on, you alone will be his father, provider of everything, saviour and protector in danger. 'This prosperous son of Tara, your equal in valour, will remain with you in the forefront to crush demons. 'This mighty hero Angada, son of Tara, is young and dynamic. He will strike (the enemy) in a fitting manner in war. 'Tara, daughter of Sushena, is wise and efficient in discerning subtle matters and in foreseeing unexpected events. 'Tara's opinion is never wrong. It does not change. Whatever she speaks is right and should be carried out without any doubt. 'You ought to carry out Rama's work without hesitation. If you do not, it will be unrighteous and harmful. 'O Sugriva put on this divine golden necklace. It has great brilliance. Its present lustre may be gone when I am dead.' Thus spoken to by Vali with brotherly affection, Sugriva gave up joy (of victory) and appeared dull like the Moon eclipsed by planet Rahu. On hearing Vali's words, Sugriva became composed with no illfeeling. Considering it to be proper, he received with his permission the golden necklace. Having given the golden necklace to Sugriva,Vali, feeling ready to depart, looked at his son Angada who stood by and spoke affectionately: 'Enduring pleasure or pain equally  with due regard to time and place favourable to you or otherwise, you should submit to the will of Sugriva. 'O longarmed one you have always been affectionately brought up by me. Sugriva may not rear you that way. 'O conqueror of foes do not align with his enemies or with the friends of his enemies. Remain selfrestrained and loyal to Sugriva. Be subordinate to his will. 'You are not to be excessively friendly or otherise as both are serious mistakes. Therefore, be insightful.' Having spoken this, tormented by the arrow, eyes popping out and his dreadful teeth ejected, Vali remained drained of life. Then the best of the monkeys and their troop leaders bewailed the death of Vali, crying bitterly. Lord of monkeys having gone to heaven, Kishkinda looked desolate including the pleasure gardens, the mountains and forests. The monkeys also became dull. (The vanaras wailed aloud saying) 'The forests and gardens looked connected together with the flowers that swayed by his speed .Who can do that now? 'Great soul, Vali endowed with stout shoulders joined a duel with a gandharva called Golabha for fifteen years nonstop night and day. 'Great soul, Vali endowed with stout shoulders joined a duel with a gandharva called Golabha for fifteen years nonstop night and day. 'In the sixteenth year Golabha, the uncontrollable enemy was killed by Vali with his dreadful fangs and rendered protection to everybody. How did he get killed?' Just as the cattle get frightened when the leader of the herd gets killed in a huge forest full of lions, the young monkey became puzzled when the chief of monkeys got killed.",
                "Tara kissed (smelt) the forehead of the king of monkeys who had departed and said: 'O hero, not caring for my words (of caution), you are now lying with great pain on hard stones on the ground. 'O lord of monkeys you lie in the end, embracing the earth and not replying to me. Surely you deem this earth dearer than me. 'O lover of brave deeds, fate has brought you under the sway of Sugriva, although he had lost to you. 'Oh powerful Vali leaders of the bears and monkeys, the entire lot are standing near you, wailing. Angada has been  crying in grief. How is it that you are not rising up even after hearing their wailing voices and  my call? . 'Earlier you have killed enemies in combats and made them lie down where now you lie. 'O venerable hero, born in a pure and noble family, you are a lover of battles. Now you have left me an orphan. 'It is said by wise men that a girl should not be given in marriage to a warrior. See me,  the wife of a warrior, now rendered a widow. 'My pride is crushed. My husband, the ultimate resort for me is shattered.I am plunged in a vast, bottomless ocean of grief. 'My heart is surely made of hard stone yet it has not split into a hundred pieces even on seeing my husband slain 'He was my husband, my friend and naturally my loving king. He was powerful in battle.Alas the hero has died. 'Even if a woman without husband, is blessed with sons and abundant wealth and grain, still learned people call her a widow. 'O hero how is it that you are lying in a crimson bed of the pool of blood flowing from your body? 'O bull among monkeys how can I embrace you with my arms as your body is covered with dust particles and blood?. 'Sugriva has achieved his goal in his dreadful enmity (with you). His fear is dispelled by a single arrow released by Rama. 'The arrow which has pierced your body prevents me from embracing you. I am only looking at you lying (not removing the arrow lest you die).' Then Nila took out the arrow from Vali's heart with due effort as one would pull out a glowing serpent hidden in the mountain cave. As the arrrow(drenched in blood) was being pulled out, its glow looked like the Sun's rays obstructed by the peak of the western mountain. The streams of blood that flowed all over from the wounds of his body appeared like streams of water mixed with red and copper colour. She (Tara) wiped the body wounded with the weapon and covered with wardust,  sprinkling her tear drops from her eyes. Turning to the body of her husband fully drenched in blood, thus spoke Tara to her tawnyeyed  son Angada: 'O son you see the most terrific end of your father on whom enmity forced sinful deeds. 'O son offer salutations to your venerable father, the king, departing for the abode of Yama (lord of death) looking (red with blood) like the rising Sun.' Thus advised by Tara, Angada got up, clasped his father's feet with his stout arms, and saluted, saying, 'I am Angada.' 'Why do you not, with the words 'May you live long'', bless, as before, your son Angada who is greeting you? (said Tara). 'Just like a cow followed by its calf would attend upon a mighty bull struck by a lion I will wait with my son upon you who have lost consciousness (died). 'You have performed a warsacrifice. You have bathed in the waters of Rama's weapon signifying the end of the sacrifice. How did you take this customary bath without me, your wife? 'Why do I not see on your chest the golden necklace gifted by the king of the gods (Indra), pleased with you in the battle? 'O venerable one, even though life has departed from you, kingly glory does not leave you any more than the light of the setting son leaves the king of mountains. (western mountain) 'You have not followed my advice. I did not have the capacity to prevent you from going to war. The result is, you are killed and I am ruined along with my son. The goddess of fortune also is deserting me as well as your son.'       Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sugriva, the unassailable younger brother of Vali, perceiving Tara overwhelmed in the ocean of grief felt agonized for the killing of his brother of incomparable power. Face drenched with tears, highly sensitive Sugriva glanced at Tara for a moment. Pained and depressed at heart, and surrounded by attendants, he slowly approached Rama. Duly approaching the illustrious Rama, endowed with auspicious signs, who stood with his bow and serpentlike arrows, Sugriva thus submitted: 'Your majesty you have struck down Vali as promised and the consequences of your action are seen now. O prince, however, my mind is not interested in the enjoyment of pleasures. I have no interest in life. 'O Rama when the queen (Tara) is weeping, plunged in deep sorrow, the entire city is lamenting in agony, my elder brother is dead and the survival of Angada is uncertain, my mind no longer longs for the enjoyment of the kingdom. 'O prince of the Ikshvaku family, the anger due to my exilement and my intolerance of his harsh words, had made the killing of my brother agreeable to me earlier. Now that the leader of the monkey clan is killed I am  intensely hurt. 'I now feel dwelling long on the great mountain Rishyamuka  as usual and somehow  eking out a livelihood is preferable to attaining heaven as a sequel to the death of my brother. 'O Rama when the wise, highsouled Vali said to me, 'I do not like to kill you in this place be gone from here', his words reflected his nobility. This action of mine (killing of Vali) is, on the other hand, in consonance with my nature. 'O Rama prompted by passion, without thinking of the difference between obtaining the kingdom to satisfy one's desire and the consequent grief, which brother would  be willing to kill his virtuous elder brother? 'The idea of killing me was not acceptable to his noble nature, while my wicked thought caused his death. 'When my brother hit me with the branch of a tree I screamed for a while. But he pacified me and said it was improper and he would not repeat it. 'Thus while nobility, a feeling of respect,brotherliness and duty was shown to me by my brother, I exhibited wrath, passion and  frivolity, the nature of the monkey. 'O king  just as Indra committed sin by killing Tvashta, I have reaped the sin by  killing my brorther which is unthinkable, avoidable, undesirable and ignoble. 'Trees owned the sin of Indra and it was shared by the earth, water and women voluntarily.But who is there to pardon a monkey and own the sin? 'O Rama having acted in an unrighteous manner, which destroys the clan, I am not fit to accept the respect of people nor the status of a prince regent, what to speak of kingship? 'I have committed a sin which is condemned by the world. This intense grief has engulfed me just as the flow of rain water inundates the lowlying area when it rains. 'The elephant of sin (hanging heavily on me) has a tail of treacherous killing of one's own brother, which has resulted in deep sorrow in the form of a trunk, eyes, head and tusks.This elephant is striking at me as he would strike the bank of a river when he grows strong and gets puffed up with the pride of energy. (The idea of a proud elephant striking at the target is superimposed on the sin committed by Sugriva.The animal's tail is  the killing of a brother. Sugriva's remorse spreads all over the body trunk, eyes, head and tusks of the animal. As a proud elephant strikes at the river bank the sin is striking at Sugriva to destroy him. The Rupaka here is perfect and total). 'O distinguished Rama this anxiety is unbearable for me. My good behaviour is relegated to the back of my heart unable to bear the sin, just like the dirt surfaces pushing the bright colour of gold when burnt in fire. 'O Rama this race of mighty monkey chiefs is as though reduced to a halfdead state because of my action and the grief of Angada. 'One can find easily a son who is controllable and accessible in need but it is difficult to find a good son like Angada, who is virtuous and mighty and who is respectful to parents. O warrior (Rama), there is no place where I can get a brother like Vali. (A brother cannot be made. His relationship is natural. Rama stresses the same subhashita in Yuddhakanda when Lakshmana swooned). 'I am a sinner. I desire to enter the blazing fire (for atonement) in order to maintain friendship with my brother and son. At your command these vanara leaders will go round and search for Sita. 'O prince Rama even if I am dead the entire task of yours, will be accomplished by the  vanara race. I have ruined the whole race. I am sinful and not fit to live. Permit me (to enter fire). Rama, the hero of the Raghu dynasty, a destroyer of the enemy heroes, was moved to tears. He lost composure for a moment when he heard Sugriva's lament. In that moment, Rama,the protector of the world, tolerant like the earth, beheld Tara plunged in grief, looking at him again and again and weeping. The foremost ministers of Vali lifted up the beautifuleyed, noble Tara, wife of the monkey hero clinging to the body of her husband, a lion among monkeys. While Tara was clinging to her husband and struggling, and was being removed from there, she saw effulgent Rama holding bow and arrows glittering like the Sun. The fawneyed Tara saw the magnificent man of Kakutstha family endowed with all royal marks and beautiful eyes, whom she had never seen before and knew he was Rama. The noble Tara, desperate, agonised, totally shaken up quickly went near the magnanimous Rama,  who was like Indraunapproachable. Wise Tara, baffled out of grief and agitated, with pure consciousness, approached Rama,  eminent in warfare who could hit the target. And spoke: 'You are immeasurable, unassailable, self controlled, and best among the righteous. Your fame never diminishes. You have great sense of discrimination. You are known to possess forbearance like the mother earth. Your eyes are redcornered (which is a sign of valour). 'You are wielding bow and arrows. You possess mighty human limbs that have the power to destroy the enemy .You  have assumed a divine human body. 'O warrior kill me by the same single arrow with which you killed my beloved lord,Vali. I will join him after death as he will not be happy without me. 'If Vali with eyes of clear petals of a lotus does not see me in heaven, he may not join the wonderfully dressed apsarasas adorned with different kinds of red flowers in their hair. 'O Rama Vali will experience sorrow and become pale bereft of me even in heaven just as you are filled with sorrow even on a delightful mountain slope bereft of princess of Videha. 'You are aware of the grief of a young man separated from his wife. Kill me so that I can go to Vali. Let not Vali experience the sorrow of not seeing me. 'O prince as you are great, you might think of the blemish of killing a woman. Since Tara is Vali's soul, you may kill me. It will not amount to killing a woman.(You will only be killing the soul of Vali by killing Tara). 'The  sacred texts as well as Vedic statements declare that wife is an inseparable part of the  husband's soul. To the learned, there is no greater offering in the world than restoring the wife to her husband. You will not beget any sin by killing me. 'O gallant prince  if you give me away to my dear lord, carefully considering dharma, you will not be committing any adharma by killing me since it will be an offering. 'O king it is proper on your part to kill me as I am in great distress. I am a helpless orphan torn away from her husband.O king I will not live long without the wise leader of monkeys who walked majestically like an elephant and wore the choicest golden necklace'. Implored by Tara this way, the great soul, Rama, lord of the earth said to Tara these words of consolation: 'O king it is proper on your part to kill me as I am in great distress. I am a helpless orphan torn away from her husband.O king I will not live long without the wise leader of monkeys who walked majestically like an elephant and wore the choicest golden necklace'. Implored by Tara this way, the great soul, Rama, lord of the earth said to Tara these words of consolation: 'O wife of a valiant warrior Do not lose heart. The entire world is controlled by the creator. People maintain that joy and sorrow are foreordained. Consoled by the influential Rama, scorcher of enemies, Tara the charming wife of a warrior, stopped wailing aloud.       Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama and Lakshmana were equally sad. Rama, scion of the Kakutstha race, consoled Sugriva, Tara as well as Angada in the following words: 'No lamentation revives the dead. So you should take up whatever is required now. 'You have to go the worldly way. You have shed tears enough. Time is passing. You cannot perform the funeral after the lapse of appropriate time. 'Fate is the cause of the world. Fate is the means of accomplishment. Fate assigns duties to all beings. 'No one can control another's action. No one including God can be the agent of action. No one has the power to entrust duty to others. This entire world is governed by one's own nature. Nature in turn is governed by Time (fate). 'God (though independent) does not deviate from Time. Time cannot be escaped or trangressed. It cannot be condoned or avoided. No one can transgress their own nature. 'Time has no consideration for relationship, friendship, or kinship or valour. Time itself is the cause. It is never under one's control. 'However a wise man should visualise the turn of events in course of time with the right vision. Dharma, artha and kama are controlled by an order laid down by Time. 'Vali, king of monkeys is dead and gone. He acted according to his own nature and attained the sacred fruit of his action comensurate with dharma, wealth and pleasures in this world. 'Great Vali has earned a place in heaven by virtue of his own dharma and not caring for his own life .He has got the heavenly position he earned. 'The state attained by the chief of monkeys is an excellent one.Therefore there is no need to regret. Attend to your duties (relating to rites)' Seeing Sugriva had lost his senses, Lakshmana, the slayer of enemy warriors humbly said at the end of Rama's address: 'O Sugriva perform with Tara and Angada the funeral obsequies relating to the cremation of Vali. 'Let the best of dry logs and sandalwood be ordered for the funeral rites of Vali. 'Pacify the despondent Angada so that he does not entertain childish thoughts any more. This city is under your control (now). 'Let Angada for his part collect garlands of many kinds, clothes, clarified butter, oil, fragrants and all that is required to be procured. 'O Tara quickly get a swiftmoving litter fastened with ropes specially  suitable for this occasion. 'Let those who are strong and capable among the monkeys be ready to carry  the dead body of Vali on a litter'. Having thus spoken to Sugriva, Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, slayer of enemies, stood by his brother On hearing Lakshmana, Tara in an excited state quickly entered the cave city to get the litter. Tara jumped in on to the litter carried by strong monkeys. A swiftmoving, marvellous palanquin designed by Viswakarma was brought. Covered with colourful pictures of birds and trees on every side it looking like an aerial chariot fit for saints. Fitted with a splendid seat grilled windows, artificially made small caverns and grottos of wood was embellished with carvings of mountains, choice ornaments and garlands. With red sandal paste, red scented flowers and red lotus garlands, it resembled the rising Sun. A swiftmoving, marvellous palanquin designed by Viswakarma was brought.

With red sandal paste, red scented flowers and red lotus garlands, it resembled the rising Sun. Seeing the palanquin, Rama said to Lakshmana 'Let the body of Vali be placed in the palanquin quickly and last rites duly performed'. Then Sugriva along with Angada, crying aloud bitterly, lifted the body (of Vali) and placed it on the palanquin. Vali's deadbody was placed on the palanquin, decorated with many ornaments, garlands and clothes King Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, said, 'Let the funeral rites of my noble sire be performed in a fitting manner'. 'Let the monkeys march in front, showering many different gems in large quantities and let the palanquin follow. 'Let the monkeys perform the funeral rites of our lord in an honourable way as expensively as has been done with regard to the obsequies of kings who ruled over this land. Tara, Angada and the other bereaved monkeys hastened to perform the funeral ceremony of Valiweeping. Then all the female monkeys who were in his (Vali's) harem walked past the deadbody of Vali, crying again and again 'Alas, Oh hero' Tara along with other female monkeys followed their lord, crying pathetically. When the female monkeys were weeping in the midst of the forest, it looked as if the forest and the hills were also mourning. Tormented with tears, the monkeys prepared in a solitary place surrounded by waters a pyre on the sandbank of a mountain stream. Putting down the palanquin from their shoulders on the lonely spot, the bearers stood in tearswaiting. Seeing her husband lying in the palanquin, Tara, full of grief placed Vali's head on her lap and cried. 'Why don't you look at me, oppressed with tears, O monkey king, O my venerable lord, O longarmed one, O my dear? 'Why don't you look at me, oppressed with tears, O monkey king, O my venerable lord, O longarmed one, O my dear? 'O revered self even though you are bereft of life, your face looks cheerful. It carries the colour of the setting Sun, and looks the same when you were alive. 'O monkey a single arrow from Rama who appeared in the forest in the form of death dragged you away from us and turned us all into widows. 'O king of kings why don't you understand that these female monkeys, your wives who were dear to you have come on foot this long distance with great difficulty? 'O lord of monkeys these moonfaced wives were indeed once your favourites. Why don't you look  at them? Why don't you look Sugriva? 'O king O sinless hero Tara and others, your ministers as well as the inhabitants of the capital are here sitting around you. 'O conqueror of enemies give these monkeys their due in accordance with their status and send them back as you used to do when they were passionately sporting in your company here in this forest. The griefstricken female monkeys helped Tara, overwhelmed with sorrow due to her husband's death, rise from the ground. Then Angada, helped by Sugriva, placed his father's body on the pyre, with his senses numbed in deep sorrow. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he offered fire to the father who had set out on a long journey (to heaven). As per tradition he went round the pyre anteclock wise. The monkeys set Vali's body to be consumed by fire as per tradition and proceeded to an auspicious river of pure water in order to offer oblation (to the departed soul). Then the monkeys along with Sugriva and Tara positioning Angada in the forefront made waterofferings (to Vali) collectively. Mighty Rama, who was equally sorrowful and pitiable as Sugriva, directed the performance of funeral rites.",
                "Then the chiefs of the army of the monkeys surrounded  Sugriva, who was overcome with grief and was still in wet clothes (since he had taken bath at the conclusion of the funeral rites) and waited. Just like sages stand before the creator Brahma, all the monkeys stood with folded hands before the longarmed Rama, the remover of sorrow. Hanuman, son of the Windgod, glowing like a golden mountain, whose face resembled the rising Sun addressed Rama with folded hands: 'O Lord by your grace Sugriva inherited the ancestral kingdom which would have been otherwise difficult. 'Permitted by your gracious self, he will enter the auspicious city along with his friends and perform his duties. He had his auspicious bath in fragrant waters with medicinal herbs as per tradition. 'Permitted by your gracious self, he will enter the auspicious city along with his friends and perform his duties. He had his auspicious bath in fragrant waters with medicinal herbs as per tradition. 'He wants to propitiate you first specially with garlands and  gems. Pray enter this beautiful mountain cave for the pleasure of the monkeys and establish relationship with king Sugriva.' Requested by Hanuman who was skilful in conversation, wise Rama, slayer of enemies, replied: 'Dear Hanuman In obedience to my father's command I should not enter any village or city for fourteen years. 'Let Sugriva enter the beautiful prosperous cavern (Kishkinda) and be installed by you as king with due rituals.' Having thus spoken to Hanuman, Rama who knew etiquette addressed mighty  Sugriva, endowed with wisdom: 'O hero consecrate Angada as heirapparent since he deserves it as the eldest son of your brother, a noble soul and equal to you in prowess. 'O hero consecrate Angada as heirapparent since he deserves it as the eldest son of your brother, a noble soul and equal to you in prowess. 'O noble Sugriva the four months from now will be rainy season. This is Sravana, the first month of the season in which rain is expected to start pouring. 'O goodnatured Sugriva this is not a suitable time for any endeavour. Go to the auspicious capital city of Kishkinda and I will reside on the mountain with Lakshmana. 'Dear Sugriva this cavern of the mountain is large and airy. It has abundant water resources with lotuses and lilies. 'Enter the city and get yourself installed and cheer your friends. Make all arrangement for killing Ravana when the month of Kartika begins as it is the proper time (for the purpose). Thus permitted by Rama , Sugriva, lord of the monkeys entered the beautiful city of Kishkinda (once) ruled by Vali. Thousands of monkeys entered the city of Kishkinda along with their king, and stood  in attendance everywhere. Then all the subjects of the city collected together, prostrated to the chief of the monkey clan with their forehead touching the ground (as a mark of respect) and sat down. Asking the monkeys to rise to their feet, the mighty and powerful Sugriva entered the inner chambers of his brother. With Sugriva,the lord of the monkeys, returned to Kishkinda, his kith and kin  coronated him just as the gods consecrated the thousandeyed Indra. The monkeys brought a white canopy decorated with gold and two chamaras with glorious golden staff. They also brought jewels, all kinds of medicinal herbs, sprouts, sap from trees, white flowers and white clothes, unguents, garlands of fragrant lotuses that grow on land and water, heavently sandal, fragrants of different kinds, goldcoloured paddy, honey of priyanga, curds, tiger skin and sandals made of boar skin.

Then sixteen beautiful, cheerful females appeared with unguent, gorochana mixed with red arsenic (used for putting tilaka on the forehead). Then they duly propitiated the brahmins, offering them gifts of gems, clothes and eatables. Then the priests (people who recite Vedic hymns) strew around kusa grass, kindled sacred fire with recitation of mantras and made offerings of havis into the fire. Then Sugriva was seated facing the east on a golden throne with fine coverings on top of the mansion decorated with multicoloured garlands. As per tradition, sacred waters  collected from rivers and rivulets and stored in golden pots was aportioned in accordance with the procedure ordained by the sages in sastras. At the appropriate time the pure and fragrant water was poured by Gaja, Gavaya, Sarabha, Mainda, Dvivida, Hanumanta, Jambavan and Nala on Sugriva, the bull among monkeys through horns of bulls and jars of gold, like the eight Vasus bathed the thousandeyed Indra. Thus they performed the consecration. Then Sugriva was seated facing the east on a golden throne with fine coverings on top of the mansion decorated with multicoloured garlands.

Thus they performed the consecration. As Sugriva was ceremoniously consecrated, thousands of monkeys rejoiced and shrieked out of joy. In obedience to Rama's instruction, Sugriva, lord of the monkeys installed Angada as prince regent and embraced him. The great monkeys concerned hailed Sugriva's action  saying, 'well done, well done' on the installation of Angada. As Sugriva and Angada were installed, all the monkeys were highly pleased and praised the noblehearted Rama and Lakshmana again and again. The beautiful city of Kishkinda situated in a mountaincave, decorated with banners and flags was filled with happy, wellfed citizens.",
                "After the consecration, Sugriva entered the cavecity (of Kishkinda) and Rama accompanied by his brother reached mountain Prasravana. The (Prasravana) mountain reverberated with the terrific roars of tigers and deer and lions. There were several kinds of shrubs, creepers and trees.It was inhabited by bears, apes, monkeys and wild cats in large number. The mountain was like a huge cluster of clouds. The waters in the ponds were pure. The (Prasravana) mountain reverberated with the terrific roars of tigers and deer and lions. There were several kinds of shrubs, creepers and trees.It was inhabited by bears, apes, monkeys and wild cats in large number. The mountain was like a huge cluster of clouds. The waters in the ponds were pure. Rama and Lakshmana decided to reside in the long, wide cave on top of the great mountain. Sinless Rama, the delight of the Raghus made an agreement with Sugriva and then spoke appropriately to Lakshmana, his obedient brother and enhancer of glory: 'O Saumitri, subduer of enemies this beautiful mountain cave is spacious and  adequately ventilated. We will reside here in the rainy season. 'O prince this lovely mountain peak is lofty. It has white, black and red stones with many kinds of minerals scattered all over. It is delightful with caves and streams, and various clusters of trees and variegated vines. The chirps of several kinds of birds as well as the sounds of excellent peacocks are heard here. This place is delightful with bushes of jasmine, kunda and sindhuvara, sireeshaka, kadamba, arjuna and sarja in bloom. 'O prince this lovely mountain peak is lofty.

'O Lakshmana at the entrance of the cave is a rock, smooth and large,  resembling a heap of shining collyrium. 'O dear look at the mountain peak in the north rising like a raincloud.It is auspicious.  It resembles a heap of collyrium. 'In the southern direction is a white rock appearing as if it is another mountain. It looks like mount Kailas and is rich with various minerals. 'Look at the river flowing towards the east. It has clean water and flows towards the east of the cave and looks like the river Jahnavi flowing on the mount Trikuta. This place looks delightful with the sandalwood, tilaka, sala, tamala, atimukta, padmaka, sarala and asoka trees. 'Look at the river flowing towards the east.

'This placid river water is haunted by waterbirds, peacocks and kraunchas, It is inhabited by groups of sages. 'See the uniform rows of sandalwood trees, it looks as though they are arranged together imaginatively. 'O Saumitri destroyer of enemies this place is most enchanting. Surely we will reside here sporting in joy . 'O prince  Sugriva's delightful city of Kishkinda with wonderful forest around is not  far from here. 'O hero among the victorious, the sounds of vocal and instrumental music, the beating of drums and shrieking of monkeys are heard (from here). 'Having obtained his wife, his kingdom and attained prosperity the monkey chief,                                 Sugriva will be surely enjoying the company of friends and relatives'. Having said so, Rama resided with Lakshmana on the Prasvarana mountain with many beautiful caverns and shrubs of vines. Though Rama was residing in comfort on the mountain richly endowed with many pleasant things, he experienced little happiness. Specially with the rising Moon in the east, he remembered his abuducted wife who was dearer to him than his life. As Rama lay in bed, at night, his grief rose and choked him with tears. Seeing Rama worried and engrossed in endless sorrow, his brother Lakshmana who was equally sad spoke these words of consolation: 'O heroic one, you know one who broods fails to achieve his objective. So do not brood. 'O Rama you are a man of action, enterprising. You are godfearing, righteous and religious. You will not be able to kill a crooked enemy in a battle, especially a demon, with your valour if you make no endeavour. 'O Rama you are a man of action, enterprising. You are godfearing, righteous and religious. You will not be able to kill a crooked enemy in a battle, especially a demon, with your valour if you make no endeavour. 'Root out sorrow. Be daring. Be firm in resolve. (Only) then can you destroy the demon and his family. 'O Kakutstha, you can turn the earth with its oceans, forests and mountains, what to speak of Ravana. 'This is the rainy season.Wait for autumn.Thereafter you will destroy Ravana along with his kingdom and clan. 'I am only awakening your dormant valour as one would kindle the fire covered with ashes by making offerings.' On hearing the good counsel and auspicious words of Lakshmana, Rama spoke these loving and warm words: 'O Lakshmana you have spoken the words of an affectionate and friendly counsellor of proven valour. 'This sorrow which dampens one's daring spirit is given up. I shall now resort to such  undaunted valour during my heroic exploits. 'I will wait for autumn. I will stick to your advice while I wait until Sugriva and the rivers are pleased (with moderate flow of water.) Then Lakshmana reflected upon the words of Rama thoughtfully. He honoured his brother's words by receiving his advice with folded hands and spoke to his handsome brother giving out his own views: 'O lord of men, your desire will be fulfilled soon. Be determined to fight the enemy while waiting for autumn. Forgive this rainy season (and its water that obstructs). 'Control your anger and wait for autumn. Pardon these (intervening) four months (which put a halt on your wareffort). Stay with me on this mountain infested with lions. Brace up to kill the enemy.       Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After the killing of Vali and installation of Sugriva as king, Rama arrived at mountain Malyavan to reside.He said to Lakshmana: 'Now that the rainy season has started, see the sky covered with mountainlike (huge) clouds. 'The sky has drained the water from the oceans through the Sun's rays and has borne it for nine months (from Kartika to Asarha) in its womb. It delivers water which is the base for all juices. 'It is possible to climb up to the sky on the stairs formed by the clouds and decorate the Sungod with garlands made of kutaja and arjuna flowers. 'The sky looks as though its wounds are dressed with pale white moistureladen bandage cloths of clouds, red in the border, tinged as they are with the glow of twilight. 'The sky with its gentle winds as its sighs, its ash coloured clouds (suggestive of a pale face) painted with red sandalpaste in the form of glow of twilight appears like a passionate lover. 'This earth scorched by the heat and then flooded with fresh rain water, radiating heat, appears like my Sita shedding tears burning with grief. 'The winds released from the wombs of clouds, cool as the delicate touch of white lotuses,charged with the fragrance of ketaka flowers can be inhaled through the hollow of one's palms. 'This mountain scented by the fragrance of arjuna and ketaka flowers is bathed in rain water just as Sugriva, tranquilled by the destruction of the enemy is consecrated in streams of (sacred) waters. 'The mountains are covered with dark clouds which appear like the hide of the antelope. Streams of rain water flowing are like the sacred threads hanging down the shoulder and the sounds of wind filling the caves resemble the recitation of Vedas by priests. (These mountains are comparable to the brahmacharins engaged in the recitation of Vedas wearing antelopeskin and sacred threads). 'The sky lashed with lightnings with whips of gold and emitting groans in the form of peals of thunder, appears as though crying in severe pain. 'The triggering of lightning in the dark clouds appears to me like austere Vaidehi struggling helplessly to get free from the lap of Ravana. 'Smeared as it were with dense clouds and therefore blocked the directions in which planets including the Moon cease to appear are favourable to lovers. The Moon is said to accenuate the pangs of separation from one's ladylove. Hence the quarters in which the Moon and the stars are hidden by clouds, have been favourable to the lovelorn. 'O Saumitri look at the kutaja flowers standing on the mountain slopes withered by the heat. They welcome the fresh showers of rain and rekindle passion in me even though my heart is overwhelmed with grief. 'Now the dust has settled and the wind carrying mist is cool. The torments of summer have ceased. The expeditions of kings have come to a stop and the travellers return to their native land. 'Desirous of living in Manasa lake swans have set out on their journey and the chakravaka birds are now united with their mates. The carts move not on the roads damaged by heavy rains. 'The sky which is visible here is not visible there due to clouds scattered. It looks bright (blue) here and dull there. It appears like an unruffled ocean interspersed with hills here and there. 'The mountainstreams of rainwater mingled with sarja and kadamba flowers carry fresh water swiftly to the ocean along with the deposits of red mineral rocks of the mountain. Hark, the peacock cries. 'The black bees like jambu fruits full of sweet juice. People share them to their hearts  content, while the mango fruits which take multiple colours on getting ripened drop on the ground shaken by the wind. The clouds that resemble high mountain peaks, having their banners of lightning with rows of herons as garlands give out loud peals of thunder like elephants in rut trumpet in battlearray. 'The tender green grass of the forest is shining with rainwater, the peacocks are having dance festival and the forests look more enchanting  in the afternoon. 'The huge rumbling clouds on the high mountain peaks carry heavy load of water. Now they rest and now resume their journey accompanied by herons. 'The happy rows of herons flying in the sky to meet the clouds, appear like a long garland of choice white lotuses strung together hanging in the sky. 'The earth shines with freshgrown, tender grass speckled here and there with small Indragopa insects. It appears like a woman wearing a parrotgreen veil sprinkled with red lac dye. 'Sleep steals over Lord Visnu. The rivers run swiftly to the sea, the female herons fly to catch the clouds joyfully. The young bride eagerly approaches her dear lord. (It is believed that Lord Visnu goes to sleep during chaturmasya, ie. from Asarh to Kartik) 'Peacocks dance in the forest. The branches of the kadamba trees get filled with flowers. Bulls long for union with the cows. The earth looks beautiful with green crops and trees. 'The clouds are raining. The rivers are flowing. Proud elephants are trumpeting. Those separated from their loved ones are brooding. The monkeys are quiet and the peacocks are dancing. 'The lordly elephants get intoxicated with the fragrance of ketaki flowers, the noise of waterfalls and the cackle of peacocks and they give out a shrill trumpet. 'Having sucked honey from the flowercups filled with honey, the bees are shedding their drunkenness slowly and hanging on the branches of kadamba trees, smitten with showers. 'The branches of jambu trees profusely  filled with fruits appear like piled up balls of charcoal, while swarms of bees rest on the branches on the jambu trees. 'The rainclouds decorated with banners of lightning and giving out peals of thunder shine like elephants in rut trumpeting, eager to fight in battle. 'Intoxicated elephants on their march along the mountain in the forest, hear the thundering sounds of clouds and suspecting it to be the call of proud elephants to fight turn back. 'Swarms of bees hum here. Peacocks dance there. Intoxicated elephants sport in water in other places. (Thus)  the forest shows its many features. 'The forest region with its various types of trees like kadamba, sarja and arjuna trees and full of fresh water shines like a tavern where girls in the form of peahens dance in excitement. 'Thirsty birds rejoice drinking exceedingly pure water held in leafcups offered by Indra (in the form of rain), which looks like pearls collected in the leafcups. As the drops fall on them the hue of their wings seems to change (fade). 'The sweet humming of bees like the music of string instruments (Vina), the croaking of frogs, the rumbling of clouds sounding like the beating of drums make it appear as if a musical concert has started in the forest. 'Here the peacocks are dancing and there they are singing. Elsewhere they are reclining on treetops with their big plumage hanging down. It appears as though the peacocks have started a musical concert in the forest. 'Frogs of different forms, colours and sounds are croaking, awakened from their long sleep by the thunders of clouds and flow of fresh rainwater. 'Washing away their broken banks which obstruct their way to the sea, the bloated rivers like proud young ladies with chakravaka birds borne on their surface ,which look like protruberant breasts, rush swiftly to meet their lord, the sea, chosen for full enjoyment with the gifts of flowers. 'Dark clouds filled with fresh water, leaning on dark clouds appear like boulders of rock, scorched with wild fire with their bases yet firmly rooted shining. 'Elephants roam the forestland inhabited by peacocks making noise out of joy, where the grassy land is filled with crawling Indragopa insects and the fragrance of kadamba and arjuna blossoms. 'The bees have quit the lotus filaments destroyed by the rain and happily move quickly towards fresh filaments of kadamba flowers. 'Intoxicated elephants roam the forest. Mighty bulls rejoice. Kings of beasts (lions) lounge. Mountains look beautiful. Kings relax. While Indra, lord of the gods, sports with clouds. 'With their big torrents, clouds hanging over the sky, drowning the roar of the sea, make the rivers, ponds, lakes and tanks overflow and flood the entire earth. 'Torrents of rain pour at great speed. Winds roar. Rivers flow swiftly changing their direction due to breach in the banks 'The mountains are consecrated with waterpitchers of clouds brought by the winds, offered by Lord Indra. Just as kings, consecrated by men, display their majesty, the mountains exhibit their form and glory. (Clouds are compared with water pots) 'Ennveloped by clouds, the Sun and stars are not visible. The earth glides with the flow of fresh waters. The directions are not clear, covered by darkness. 'The huge mountain peaks are washed by the heavy downpour of rain which look like long strings of pearls hanging. 'The waterfalls rushing down the rocks on the huge mountains and flowing through caves, and peacocks singing create an image of broken and scattered chains of pearls. 'The fast flow of waterfalls spread over vast areas completely wash the surroundings  of the mountain peaks. It appears like chains of pearls collected in the lap of huge caves. 'The strings of incomparable waterfalls all over the mountain appear as though pearls from the chains of sexually indulgent celestial women are dropping down from heaven, broken through physical friction. 'The time of the setting Sun (as he remains invisible the whole day) is known  only by the birds reaching out to their dwellings for rest, and by the closing of lotuses and blossoming jasmines. 'Expeditions by kings come to a stop. The army returns. The flow of water blocks the roads. It suspends enmity (between states). 'The month of Bhadrapada meant for the recitation of the Vedas by brahmins and for those desirous of singing  Sama Veda has started. 'Surely Bharata, king of Kosala, would have completed the collection of all his requirement before the commencement of the month of Asarh. 'Just as the cheerful voices of people of Ayodhya rise as soon as they see me returning, certainly the speed of river Sarayu is rising, filled with rain water. 'Having defeated his enemy, Sugriva with his wife during the rainy season is wellestablished in the kingdom,  abounding in merits. 'O Lakshmana I have lost my wife. I have been dethroned from the mighty kingdom. I am sinking like a river bank overflowed. 'My sorrow which increases, the rains which make it hard to cover distances and Ravana the great enemyall these appear difficult to conquer. 'Since Sugriva has gone through great difficulties and is reunited with his wives after a long time and since our task is great, I did not desire to speak to him now. 'O Lakshmana of auspicious qualities I will wait for the proper time to appease Sugriva as well as the rivers. A hero should in return help whoever has helped him. An ungrateful person hurts the heart of the virtuous by not returning the assistance.' Having heard this, Lakshmana expressed his considered opinion with due respect to handsome Rama: 'O Rama come Autumn, Sugriva will soon do all that you desire. Bear with the rains. Stay steadfast (in your determination) to destroy the enemy.       Thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",

'The kingdom, glory and fame of a king who knows the value of time and conducts himself well towards his allies always grows. 'He to whom the treasury, sceptre, allies and his own self all these are equally dear,  enjoys a large kingdom. 'Endowed with right conduct, you ought to duly answer the cause of your ally conforming to proper course of action. 'Whoever sets aside his personal interest and works for the welfare of his ally with due enthusiasm and excitement  will not be harmed. 'He who exceeds the time limit in accomplishing a friend's task, and puts forth great effort later succeeds not.

'O subduer of enemies we should do the brave deed of finding Vaidehi for the sake of your friend. O crusher of enemies this is your duty at present and it is already delayed. 'O king a wise man (like Rama) who is aware of timely action would not tell you even if it is unduly delayed, even when he is in a hurry to get the work done, since he is staying in your kingdom (since he is dependant on you). 'Rama is  responsible in lending stability to you and to your wellknown family. He will continue to be your ally for a long time. Let it be known that his power is boundless and his virtues peerless. 'O king pray accomplish his object the same way he has accomplished your own. You ought to issue orders to the foremost of the monkeys. 'Time will not be deemed lapsed in vain if the work is sincerely taken up without delay and without pressure from your ally, Rama. If it is undertaken under pressure, it will be considered transgression of time. 'O lord of monkeys help even a person who has not helped you. As such, do you need to be told that you should help one, with whose help you have earned wealth and kingdom? 'O protector of the monkeys, you are powerful and you are prompt. Why don't you issue orders which will please Rama? 'Indeed, Rama is fully capable of subduing gods, demons as well as nagas with his arrows. He is looking for your help in view of your promise. 'He has done you a deed dear to you without hesitation, risking his own life.Let us help him in search of his Vaidehi whether she is on earth or in heaven. 'Not gods, demons, gandharvas or even marutas, suras or yakshas can cause fright in him much less the rakshasas. 'Therefore, O king of monkeys you ought to oblige Rama wholeheartedly exerting all your strength, as he has done your work. 'O lord of monkeys commanded by you, each one of us or all of us together can ransack the underworld, the earth, or water or heaven. O sinless hero therefore issue your command. There are more than a crore of invincible monkeys. Determine  now who should  do and what and in which place. We are at your service'. Sugriva who had a great sense of duty, started applying  his mind, when he heard the honest advice of Hanuman. He sent word to the ever diligent Nila, his favourite, to collect all cadres of army of the monkeys from all directions. 'Let the entire army with leaders of different groups assemble here seperately. O chief of army act accordingly. 'Let the swiftfooted monkeys, guardians of frontiers, army chiefs muster soon in obedience to my command. You (Nila) alone should personally  supervise the work to be done next. 'In strict obedience to my orders, go with Angada to the elderly monkeys and inform them about my decision and order'. After making this arrangement valiant Sugriva entered his residence.

                "While Sugriva was in his residence, Rama was (in Prasravana mountain) spending his rainy nights tormented by passion (for Sita). Sugriva was engaged in love, forgetting the time fixed for taking up the search for Sita. When the sky became clear of clouds after the rainy season, Rama sat gazing at the clear autumnal Moon's orb. He was besmeared with moonlight and felt perturbed as time was running out. And then fell into a swoon.

(only a few months remained for the completion of the exile and Bharata will put an end to himself if Rama does not return to Ayodhya on the stipulated day. This worried Rama.) Gaining back the senses after a while, wise Rama started thinking about Vaidehi, who remained in his heart. Sitting on top of the mountain shining with gold and minerals, Rama  gazed at the pleasant autumnal sky and started thinking of his beloved. Looking at the sky rid of clouds and lightning, filled with the sounds of flocks of sarasa birds, Rama cried in a pitiable state. 'How will the young lady (Sita) whose voice is like the sarasa bird's, who was revelling, listening to its sweet cackle at the hermitage be living now? 'How will my beloved wife feel on seeing the asana flowers which are as pure as gold, when she does not find me anywhere? 'How will my Sita with her charming limbs and sweet words, who used to get up from sleep by the cackle of swans, wake up now? 'How will that  lady with large, pale white eyes sustain her life now, since she is used to listening to the sweet notes of chakravaka birds, who were her companions? 'Even though I am wandering by lakes, rivers, wells, forests and groves,I am not happy without that fawneyed lady. 'I think even the charm of autumn must be always tormenting that lovely lady, as she is very far from me. She is too delicate to suffer the agony of separation.' Thus the best among the princes wailed just as chakrabaka laments for water from Indra, lord of the gods. Graceful Lakshmana returned after going round and round the beautiful mountain slopes for fruits and saw his brother. Observing Rama who had lost his senses, lying alone in unbearable agony, venerable Lakshmana became sad and miserable and spoke to his brother: 'O revered brother why do you succumb to passion and loss of selfconfidence? Why is the usual composure of your mind withdrawn? Why do you desist from yaga? 'You are an undaunted warrior. Take to the path of action. Resort to samadhiyoga or meditation and regain the serenity of mind. Make the strength of your effort the source of your success. 'O lord of the human race O worthy hero when you are the protector, Janaki cannot be retained by any one easily just as burning fire after it reaches its full height cannot be retained by any one.' Rama said to Lakshmana, an unassailable warrior with auspicious signs, that what he had spoken was natural, beneficial, wise and useful.It is in accordance with Sama Veda and the science of statecraft, well established in dharma and artha. 'My dear, there is no doubt that I have to consider the work (ahead), give special attention to follow up. Surely I need to think over this herculian task and its achievement'. Then falling back on the memory of Maithili, the lady with eyes like lotus petals, he said to Lakshmana with parched lips: 'Having satisfied the earth with abundant rain water and having fulfilled the task of ripening the crops, the thousandeyed Indra has done his duty, has settled down now. 'O prince having discharged their water the clouds (after the rains) are exhausted. They are moving now over trees and mountains, making deep and pleasant sounds. 'The clouds, which were dark till now like the blue lotus petals darkening all the ten directions  are like elephants free from all intoxication as their fury is abated 'O dear the moist winds have ceased to blow as before and are carrying the fragrance of kutaja and arjuna flowers. 'O sinless Lakshmana the rumblings of heavy clouds, the trumpeting of elephants, the cry of peacocks and the sound of waterfalls have become suddenly stilled. 'The mountain slopes, having  been washed by the showers of rain on all sides, are cleansed. They are shining in variegated colours and look as though the mountain peaks are smeared with glowing colours (of minerals). 'The autumn has set in, manifesting its grace on the branches of saptachada trees(sevenleafed banana plant) through the radiance of stars, Sun and Moon and through the sports of excellent elephants. 'From the beauty of autumn manifested in a variety of ways on the clusters of lotuses, touched by the Sun, it seems the goddess of wealth shines and shines effulgently. (The lotus is goddess Laxmi's favourite flower) 'The wind carries the fragrance of saptachada flowers. Attracted by the fragrance, swarms of bees come humming. The pride of the elephants in rut increases. 'The swans have come face to face with chakravaka birds. They have newly arrived.  Lovers of lakes, they are shaking the pollen of lotuses on their lovely wide wings and have settled on the sandy bankssporting. 'Goddess Laxmi with her scattered self shines there among the proud elephants, among herds of excited bulls and among streams with clear water. 'The sky is free from clouds. The peacocks have shed their ornamental plumes. They have lost interest in their beloveds. With their glory withdrawn, the peacocks are devoid of happiness and absorbed in the thought of the clouds. 'The forests are delightful to the eyes, as if illuminated by a large number of goldencoloured, finesmelling priyaka branches bent under the heavy loads of flowers. 'Lordly elephants accompanied by their dear female mates, fond of lotus ponds  and woods are out to enjoy the sweet smell of the blossoms of saptachada  and excited by passion and longing for sexual union are moving slowly. 'Cleared of the black clouds, the sky is shining like a polished weapon. The river waters flow feebly. Winds blowing over white lotuses feel cool. All quarters clear of darkness are shining. 'The bulls surrounded by cows are bellowing with the dust settled on their limbs. Excited by passion they are happy, ready to fight. They look attractive, blessed by the attributes of Autumn. 'The female elephants of good breed, deeply passionate, gather round and follow their intoxicated lord moving slowly through the forest. 'The peacocks have shed their ornamental wear, their plumes. They are moving on the river banks miserably, devoid of high spirit as if they are being taunted by flocks of sarasa birds (who are highspinted and cheerful). 'Excellent elephants in rut, with ichor exuding from their temples trumpet, frightening the ducks and chakravaka birds in the water. Strirring the water in the lakes, ornamented with lotuses, they drink it. 'The swans are full of joy, flocking on the sand banks of rivers crowded with cows where the water is pure and devoid of mud. The rivers are full of sarasa birds and swans who are singing delightfully. 'Suddenly the turbulent sounds of the river waters, waterfalls and thunderclouds have stopped. The peacoks having lost the pleasure of blowing winds lost their excitement. The croaking of frogs is silent. 'With no new rainclouds (in the sky), venomous, multicoloured serpents crawl out of the anthills with emacited (hybernated) bodies, troubled by hunger due to long confinement. 'While the stars appear with the soothing touch of the Moon's beams, this ruddy twilight is quitting the sky on her own. 'The night appears like a lady with a sweet face lit up by the rising Moon, her beautiful eyes opened up by stars, her body draped in the robe of white Moon light. 'Driven by the wind, the lovely sarasa birds, after eating ripened grains from paddy fields happily fly the sky in rows like a garland at great speed. 'With a single swan in sleep night lotuses blooming around it, the water in the big tank appear like the sky free from clouds with the full Moon and clusters of stars scattered. (The swan is the moon, the lotuses the stars and the clean pond the sky). 'Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth (also of autumn) appears decorated with deep wells like an excellent lady with swans as girdles and blooming lotuses and lilies as  garlands. 'The whistling of bamboos enhanced by the wind in the early morning, and the bellowing of bulls echoing in the caves supplement each other as it were. 'The river banks shining with fresh white flowers of kasa reeds swayed by the gentle breeze silken look like a lady wrapped in white silk. 'The butterflies glitter around in the forest fearlessly showing their skill in drinking honey, with their backs turned white with the dust of pollen grains from the lotus cups. They follow the wind along with their loved ones in the forest. 'The fresh blooms of night lotuses, the cackle of krauncha birds, fully ripened fields of paddy, the gentle breeze and the bright Moon indicate the coming to an end of the rainy season and setting in of autum. 'Now the riverbrides, displaying their girdles of fish, have  slowed down like the gait of sensuous ladies in the early morning, exhausted by sexual pleasures. 'Crowded with chakravaka birds and green moss, and covered with kasa reeds like silken veils, the river banks appear like the face of the bride decorated with designs of green leaves and gorochana tilaka. 'Now Cupid is moving unobstructed showing his power by holding his bow indicating strict punishment to those separated from their beloveds in the forests with bana and asana flowers in bloom and bees humming happily. 'Having showered heavy rains, and filling tanks and rivers, and producing bumper crops on the earth the clouds have disapeared. 'Just as bashful young brides show their loins slowly during their first sexual meet the rivers start showing their sandy banks slowly in autumn. 'O gentle Lakshmana the pure water in the tanks and sweet sounds of flocks of female kurari birds and chakravakas there are splendid. 'The asanas, saptaparna, kovida and bandhujeeva trees and shyama creepers are seen in full bloom on the mountain slopes. 'Lakshmana look at the swans, sarasas, chakravakas and kurara birds scattered all over the river banks. 'O handsome prince the time has come for making expeditions by kings against the enemies waiting for victory. 'O prince this is time for the first expedition (of the year) by kings. I do not find Sugriva making effort in that direction. 'O gentle one, the four months of rainy season are spent without seeing Sita. It is equal to a hundred years for my griefstricken heart. 'Just as a female chakravaka follows the male, Sita followed her husband into this dense Dandaka forest as though it is a pleasuregarden. 'O Lakshmana king Sugriva shows no mercy on one, who is griefstricken, separated from his wife, and banished from the kingdom. 'O gentle one although I am a vanquisher of foes, this evilminded king of monkeys is slighting me because I am away from home, I have lost my kingdom, I am outraged by Ravana, I am miserable and lovesick and I have sought his help. 'O gentle one although I am a vanquisher of foes, this evilminded king of monkeys is slighting me because I am away from home, I have lost my kingdom, I am outraged by Ravana, I am miserable and lovesick and I have sought his help. 'The evilminded Sugriva, having fulfilled his objective, does not realise that he has made a promise to me and has reached the time set for the search of Sita. 'Go to Kishkinda and speak (on my behalf ) to that  fool, Sugriva, the chief of monkeys who is revelling in habitual sensual pleasures 'He who, having promised to his friend to grant his desire and who, having been obliged, fails to implement the promise, is the lowest on earth. '(On the other hand) he who honours his promise, whether good or bad, is truly heroic, the best of men.' 'Even the carnivorous animals dislike to eat the body of such ungrateful men who do not help their friends even though they have received help and have achieved their objective.' 'Surely he wishes to see the form of my bow inlaid with gold bent by me to its full length, looking like a streak of lightning. 'Perhaps he wants once again to hear when enraged in a combat, the dreadful twang of my bow, resembling the peal of a thunderbolt . 'O prince knowing my valour fully welI, and knowing that you are here to help me he is unhesitatingly revelling in sensual pleasures. 'O conqueror of the enemy capital the monkey lord who has achieved his goal does not realise the importance of my mission. 'Having promised (to search for Sita) after the rainy season,Sugriva is not aware that he has (already) spent the four monthsrevelling. 'Sporting with the council of ministers surrounding him, resorting to drinking, he shows no compassion to us feeling wretched with grief. 'O mighty warrior O dear, go to Sugriva and make him aware of the virulence of my anger and tell him: 'The route by which Vali departed, killed by me has not been closed. O Sugriva you ought to abide by the pledge given. Do not  follow the path of Vali. 'Vali was killed by me in the battle with a single arrow while I shall kill you now along with your near and dear ones since you have deviated from the truth.' 'O bull among men O hero speak to him that  all that is done in time is done well. Hurry up. Ask him to do whatever is good for him as well as for us: 'O lord of monkeys Carry out the promise you made to me, consider it to be eternal dharma. Slain by my arrows, you will see  Vali in the abode of the lord of death.' On seeing Rama, the protector of the human race, wailing Lakshmana of terrific lustre  hardened his stand against Sugriva and proceeded, charged with intense anger.       Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing the indomitable hero, his elder brother, son of a king, lovesick, dejected and overcome by anger and grief, spoke prince Lakshmana: 'Sugriva has not stuck to the conduct of the virtuous, of sharing the fruits of action equally. He does not realize that he obtained the prosperous kingship of vanaras as a result of your (friendly) action. He does not have the intelligence of conducting himself in your favour (of searching Sita). Therefore he will not enjoy the kingship for long. 'O hero he is too ungrateful to return the favour done to him, Engaged in rustic, vulgar pleasures, he is not thinking of it. Let him see his killed elder brother. Kingship should not be given to an individual who is a destitute of virtues. 'I cannot hold my overflowing anger. I shall kill this untruthful Sugriva. Let Vali's son along with the foremost of monkeys search for the queen (Sita).' Rama, a slayer of enemy heroes but not of those who seek his refuge, spoke in a conciliatory tone to Lakshmana who jumped, wielding bow and arrows, inspired with his fierce fighting spirit. 'O Lakshmana with your good conduct you should not do so.  Keeping in view the affectionate friendship extended (by Sugriva) earlier, be friendly. 'Sugriva has exceeded the time limit. Avoiding harsh words, you ought to speak to him in a conciliatory manner. Having been duly briefed by his elder brother, the heroic Lakshmana, destroyer of enemies, a bull among men entered the city. The noblehearted, benevolent and wise Lakshmana, eager to please Rama, picked up his bow looking like a mountain peak, comparable to the bow of Indra and agitated with the anger of the god of Death entered the mansion of Sugriva which stood like the mountain peak of Mandara. The noblehearted, benevolent and wise Lakshmana, eager to please Rama, picked up his bow looking like a mountain peak, comparable to the bow of Indra and agitated with the anger of the god of Death entered the mansion of Sugriva which stood like the mountain peak of Mandara. Then Lakshmana, obedient, intelligent like Brihaspati, like a tempest, encompassed by the fire of anger and deliberating in his mind as to the possible questions from Sugriva and the reply from him. Then Lakshmana, obedient, intelligent like Brihaspati, like a tempest, encompassed by the fire of anger and deliberating in his mind as to the possible questions from Sugriva and the reply from him. 'Lakshmana rushed on foot speedily, cutting the branches of sala, tala and asvakarna and other trees on the way  and forcibly turning and crushing the mountain rocks into pieces with a single foot, like a swiftmoving elephant taking long strides, to carry out the task. 'Lakshmana rushed on foot speedily, cutting the branches of sala, tala and asvakarna and other trees on the way  and forcibly turning and crushing the mountain rocks into pieces with a single foot, like a swiftmoving elephant taking long strides, to carry out the task. The tiger of the Ikshvaku race saw the inaccessible Kishkinda, the capital of vanara kingdom, located between mountains and fortified with the army. His lips trembling in anger, Lakshmana saw fierceful monkey guards of Sugriva at the entrance of Kishkinda city. Hundreds of monkeys of the size of elephants stood holding huge trees and boulders of rocks on seeing Lakshmana, the bull among men. On seeing the monkeys wielding weapons, Lakshmana's anger doubled like logs of firewood put to burning. Seeing enraged Lakshmana, who looked like a veritable god of Death at the time of dissolution of the universe, hundreds of monkeys, their limbs trembling in fear ran in different directions. Having entered Sugriva's palace, the monkeychiefs reported the arrival of angry Lakshmana. But Sugriva who was engrossed in overtures with passionate Tara, did not heed the words of the monkeychiefs. Commanded by the ministers, the monkeys who looked like fierce mountains, elephants and clouds that caused horripilation, left the place at once. The monkeys, their faces, deformed, their nails and teeth like weapons were dreadful and horrifying in appearance, proud as tigers Of them some possessed the strength of ten, some a hundred and some a thousand elephants. All of them were of equal valour. Enraged Lakshmana saw the huge inacccessible city of Kishkinda filled with  mighty strong and fierce monkeys holding trees in hand. The mighty monkeys came out of the entrance of the ironboundary wall from beneath and made their appearance and stood in full attention. The sensible warrior, recognising Sugriva's dereliction of duty and his own brother's agony once again flew into fury. Sighing hot, deep breath, eyes turned red in anger, this tiger among men appeared like fire with smoke (The sigh was smoke and red eyes, fire). His bow was like the hood of a snake,with the iron nails fixed on the tip of his arrows like moving fangs and his own brightness like the venom of the fivehooded snake. Dismayed, Angada approached Lakshmana, who was glowing like fire at the time of dissolution of the world and enraged like the lord of serpents. Renowned Lakshmana, with his eyes turned red in anger said to Angada 'O dear, inform Sugriva, about my arrival'. 'O subduer of enemies speak in this way: 'Lakshmana, the dear younger brother of Rama has come to you and waits for your presence at the entrance, burning in grief of his elder brother. Well, if you like to hear his words, do as you please.' 'Return swiftly after saying so.' 'O subduer of enemies speak in this way: 'Lakshmana, the dear younger brother of Rama has come to you and waits for your presence at the entrance, burning in grief of his elder brother. Well, if you like to hear his words, do as you please.' 'Return swiftly after saying so.' On hearing Lakshmana's words Angada became sad. He approached his father (Sugriva) and said 'Saumitri has come'. (This sloka appears an interpolation). On hearing Lakshmana's words powerful Angada felt agitated. His face turned pale. He went and prostrated at once to the king and then to the queen, Ruma. Highly brilliant Angada holding his father's feet first, then mother's and thereafter Ruma's, reported the matter to  Sugriva. The monkey was too drowsy with drink, too intoxicated with passion to come back to his senses. Looking at angry Lakshmana, and scared at heart, the monkeys started making a noise in order to please him. They saw Lakshmana advancing like a mighty flood and went near him making sounds like the thunderbolt or a lion. By the great sound (of the monkeys) the drunken redeyed vanara king awakened, his garlands and ornaments in disarray. On hearing Angada's words the two ministers named Plaksha and Prabhava who were perrmitted to have audience with the queens went to the harem on invitation from Angada. They reported to Sugriva about the arrival of Lakshmana who had come to speak to him about matters regading wealth and righteousness. On hearing Angada's words the two ministers named Plaksha and Prabhava who were perrmitted to have audience with the queens went to the harem on invitation from Angada. They reported to Sugriva about the arrival of Lakshmana who had come to speak to him about matters regading wealth and righteousness. Both of them sat close by Sugriva who was like Indra and said these pleasing words: 'Rama and Lakshmana, both the brothers venerable and true to their promise, have conferred on you sovereignty and have extended friendship.' 'Of the two, only Lakshmana is standing at the entrance wielding his bow in hand. The monkeys are trembling in fear and running about, making a loud noise'. 'By the command of Rama, his brother has come to you, Rama's words as charioteer and his work as chariot'. 'O blameless king Tara's son, Angada, has sent us into your presence. Lakshmana has come.' 'O lord of monkeys Valiant Lakshmana is standing at the entrance,eyes filled with anger as if he would burn the vanaras'. 'O great king Go at once with your son and relations, salute him now and avert his anger'. 'O king be true to your promise to his brother, righteous Rama without fail. Honour the agreement.'       Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing about Lakshmana's anger from Angada, prudent Sugriva consulted his counsellors. Sugriva, being skilled in secret assessment of matters, considering the merits and demerits, spoke to his council of ministers capable of intelligent counselling: 'Indeed I have not uttered any harsh word or done anything wrong. I, therefore, wonder why Rama's brother, Lakshmana is angry with me? 'Some enemies, who are always searching for imaginary faults of mine might have poisoned Lakshmana's ears. 'In the meanwhile, (right now) all of you should think quietly and try to know the reason (for Lakshmana's anger), using your intellect and expertise logically and decide( the course of action). 'I have no fear either from Lakshmana or from Rama. However, when a friend is enraged without reason, it creates misgivings. 'It is easy to earn a friend but keeping the friendship sustained is difficult. Due to fickleness of mind friendship gets broken even on flimsy grounds. 'Therefore, I am apprehensive of Rama. I am not able to repay the help he has rendered to me'. When Sugriva spoke thus, Hanuman the great monkey, submitted in the presnce of the monkeyministers, applying his own logic: 'It is not at all a matter of surprise, O king of vanara clan, that you forgot the good service rendered to you with utmost sense of friendship. 'To remove your fear and to please you, the great hero Rama has killed Vali, an equal to Indra in valour. 'Rama's anger is purely out of love for you. He has sent Lakshmana, a bestower of prosperity to you. There is no doubt about it. 'You knows best the passage of time (changing seasons). But you are not aware out of inattention that the auspicious autumn has set in, making the garden lush green with blossoms of Saptachada flowers. 'The sky from which the dark clouds have completely disappeared is illumined with planets and stars. The rivers and tanks as well as all directions are pleasant. 'O chief of monkeys it is time for military expeditions. Since you are intoxicated you are not aware of this, Lakshmana has come here evidently for this. 'The message sent by a man who is in distress, and is deprived of his wife should be accepted even if they are harsh since he is a great self (who has rendered you help). 'In these circumstances the best way is seeking apology from Lakshmana with folded hands. I do not see any way other than this. 'The counsellors and ministers appointed by a king should certainly give good advice, without fear. This I tell you since I have faith in my words. 'He who deserves propitiation, should not be offended, more so by a  grateful man, remembering the  help received by him earlier. 'O king bow down your head along with your son, friends and relations and honour the oath just as a wife subordinates to the will of the husband. Stand by obediently. 'O king of monkeys It is not right for you to overlook the commands of Rama or Lakshmana even in mind. You know the superhuman virtues of Rama, particularly his valour. The two brothers are like Indra (and Upendra) in valour and might.       Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Instructed by Rama, and having been permitted, Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies entered the frightful cave of Kishkinda. Seeing Lakshmana, the huge and mighty monkey gatekeepers stood at the entrance and greeted him with folded hands. The monkeys kept away out of fear to see the son of Dasaratha, who was angry and sighing deeply. Lakshmana, the bestower of fortune, saw the mammoth cave inlaid with gems and precious stones and forests full of delightful flowers. The palace was thronged with elevated mansions and illumined with jewels of all kinds. The trees were in bloom and the fruits satisfied every one's wish.It was splendid. The inhabitants of Kishkinda being sons of gods and gandharvas, were of beautiful appearance wearing wonderful garlands. They could change their form at their free will. They were delightful. The royal roads were filled with fragrant unguents, like sandal, agaru and lotus incenses, finesmelling honey of several kinds and happy inhabitants. Lakshmana saw tall buildings comparable to Vindhya and Meru mountains and pure water flowing from the mountain streams. On the royal road, Lakshmna saw beautiful homes of monkeychiefs Angada, Mainda, Dwivida, Gavaya, Gavaksha, Gaja, Sarabha, Vidyunmalin, Sampati, Suryaksha, Hanuman, Veerabahu, Subahu, the great Nala, Kumuda and Sushena. Similarly he saw the homes of Tara and Jambavan, Dadhivaktra, Nila, Supatala and Sunetra. (Tara mentioned here is a male monkey.)

These homes were shining like white clouds, with wonderful garlands hung on, filled with abundance of wealth, grains and best of females. The abode of Sugriva was encircled by a white rampart and unapproachable.It was enchanting like the abode of Indra. The mansion tops were like the white peaks of Kailas mountain filled with blossoming trees which could yield all kinds of fruits to suit one's taste. The trees were huge like dark clouds, cool and shady with wonderful flowers in full bloom, the riches gifted by Indra, were delightful. The entrance was guarded by mighty monkeys holding weapons in hand. It had a golden archway at the entrance decorated with wonderful garlands and strings of golden flowers.

Righteous Lakshmana crossed the seven enclosures filled with different kinds of people and saw a great harem full of several bright gold and silver cots, excellent  seats here and there with best of cushions spread. Righteous Lakshmana crossed the seven enclosures filled with different kinds of people and saw a great harem full of several bright gold and silver cots, excellent  seats here and there with best of cushions spread. As he entered, he heard melodious sounds of string instruments and music worded to metre with different kinds of tunes. Powerful Lakshmana saw many females of different forms proud of their youth and charm at the palace of Sugriva. Lakshmana saw women with a good lineage adorned with colourful flower garlands and choicest ornaments engaged in making garlands and arranging fruits. He also saw at Sugriva's palace attendants, gentle, welldressed, contented and not too busy. Lakshmana saw women with a good lineage adorned with colourful flower garlands and choicest ornaments engaged in making garlands and arranging fruits. He also saw at Sugriva's palace attendants, gentle, welldressed, contented and not too busy. Illustrious Lakshmana felt abashed on hearing the jingling of girdle bells and tinkling of the women's anklets. On hearing the sounds of ornaments (of females), heroic Lakshmana lost his temper quickly. He pulled his bowstring forcefully in wrath producing frightening sound filling all quarters. Aware of the anger of Rama (who likes it not), the longarmed Lakshmana moved away from the spot (abstained from entering private apartments) as per tradition, receded to a lonely place and stood. Then, sensing the arrival of Lakshmana, by the sound of his bow string, Sugriva the lord of vanaras, alighted at once from the throne. 'Truly Saumitri, the loving brother of Rama has arrived as announced by Angada earlier'. As proclaimed by Angada and also from the sound of the twang, Sugriva knew about the arrival of Lakshmana. His mouth parched (with fear). Then Sugriva, the best of monkeys got agitated at heart out of fear. He saw the pleasing Tara and said to her these good words clearly: 'O Tara with beautiful eyebrows this younger brother of Rama is normally softhearted. But today he arrived here angry. What could be the reason? 'O blemishless Tara  What is the cause of young Lakshmana's anger? Great men do not display anger without reason. 'If anything displeasing has been done by us, you should know and tell me quickly. You ought to speak to him at once. 'O lovely lady or else, you should see him personally and propitiate him with your soothing words. 'Lakshmana will be clear of all doubts on seeing you and will not be angry. Great men are not harsh to women. 'Start talking to him with pleasing words and make him happy. Then I shall see Lakshmana with eyes like lotuspetals, a subduer of enemies'. Tara, whose eyes were drowsy with drink, whose long gold string of the girdle was hanging loose appeared before Lakshmana with faltering steps and bent low, bashful of her appearance. (It suggests a state of exhaustion after sexual pleasures). Since prince Lakshmana is a great man, he stood with his face down and showing no reaction, controlled his anger due to the presence of a female standing close by. Setting aside her shyness for being in a drunken state, and observing Lakshmana's favourable disposition, she spoke meaningful words in a pleasing manner with friendly eloquence: 'O noble prince what is the cause of your anger? Who has disrespected your command? Who can approach without fear forest fire rushing towards a thicket of dried pieces of wood?' Having heard Tara's unhesitant submission spoken in a pleasant and friendly manner, Lakshmana replied: 'O lady, your husband engrossed in sensual pleasures, has lost sight of dharma and artha. Why don't you understand it in the interest of your husband whose wellwisher you are? 'O Tara that we are in grief Sugriva does not realize. He is not attending to state affairs. He is only enjoying drinking in the company of ministers. 'The king of monkeys has already spent four months, enjoying drinks. He does not realize that he has flouted his promise. 'Drinking this way does not help accomplishment of dharma and artha. It destroys wealth, ambition and righteousness. 'Dharma is violated when we help not one who has helped. Loss of a virtuous friend leads to great loss of wealth. It results in destruction. 'You have a strong sense of duty. You ought to tell him his duty and what we should do in this situation. Tara heard the sweet words of Lakshmana which showed his good understanding of dharma and artha. What she said to him in reply reflects her faith in Sugriva's effort to help Rama's cause: 'O prince this is not the time to get angry with your own people. He (Sugriva) is your friend and wishes to do your work. You should bear with him even if he makes a mistake. 'O prince how can you, richly endowed with virtues be angry with an inferior person? How can a person like you, preeminent in virtues,and a source of great penance fall a victim to anger? 'I know about the anger of (Rama), the friend of Sugriva. I am aware of the time limit set for his work. I am aware of our omissions in this regard. I also know about the mission. 'O Lakshmana I am aware of the irresistible strength of lust born out of the body. I am aware of Sugriva's indifference to his duty due to his  passion with whomsoever it be. 'You are under the grip of anger and your mind is not involved in carnal desire. One who is engaged in sensual pleasures does not reckon time and place, nor does he consider artha and dharma. 'O slayer of enemy heroes pardon Sugriva, the lord of vanara clan, who is to you a brother. He is here indulging in sports of love with me. He has no sense of shame about his passion. 'Even sages committed to piety and austerity are sometimes deluded by sensual gratification. He is a king and a monkey who is fickle by nature. How can he be not tempted by sensual pleasures'? Overcome by drunkenness, Tara once again spoke to Lakshmana of unfathomable prowess, in a meaningful way keeping in view the welfare of her playful and drunken lord: 'O best of men although overpowered by sense pleasures, Sugriva has already initiated efforts for the accomplishment of your work. 'O great warrior monkeys residing at different mountains who can assume any form they like have arrived in hundreds and thousands of crores. 'O longarmed one  come in. You have been standing out guarding your character. It is not a mistake to see the wife of a pious person with a friendly feeling. Strongarmed Lakshmana, a subduer of enemies, permitted by Tara entered the harem immediately (thinking of the urgency of the task). Lakshmana saw famous Sugriva, difficult to be conquered, seated on a golden throne strewn around with cushions, decorated with ornaments of different colours, endearing in appearance, decked with beautiful garlands and clothes. He was surrounded by women adorned with most fascinating ornaments and garlands. Bewildered at the sight, Lakshmana's eyes turned red in anger. He appeared like Yama, lord of death.

                "On seeing the angry Lakshmana, a bull among men, who could not be obstructed,  enter in,  Sugriva was disturbed. Seeing enraged Lakshmana, son of Dasaratha, sighing heavily, glowing like bright fire burning with the sorrow of Rama, Sugriva jumped out of his seat quitting the decorated golden throne just as Indra's decorated banner is raised up suddenly. Seeing enraged Lakshmana, son of Dasaratha, sighing heavily, glowing like bright fire burning with the sorrow of Rama, Sugriva jumped out of his seat quitting the decorated golden throne just as Indra's decorated banner is raised up suddenly. As soon as Sugriva jumped up ,Ruma and other womenfolk rose to their feet like the clusters of stars around the fullMoon in the sky. With eyes red as blood through drunkenness,prosperous Sugriva was shaken like the Kalpa tree.He stood there and offered salutations(to Lakshmana) with folded hands. Looking at Sugriva surrounded by Ruma and other women like the Moon among stars, infuriated Lakshmana said 'Only a king who is an heir to a noble family, compassionate, and selfcontrolled, grateful and truthful excels in the world. 'Which king can be more malicious than the one who makes false promises and adopts an unrighteous path towards those who helped him? 'If a man tells a lie about a horse, he commits the sin of killing a hundred horses. If one tells a lie about a cow, he shares the sin of killing a thousand cows. If one tells a lie about a man, it is equal to the sin of killing oneself and his own people. 'O lord of monkeys he who, having accomplished his task first with the help of his friend, does not return the help is ungrateful. Such a person deserves to be killed.It applies to all beings. 'O lord of the monkeys here is a verse worthy of appreciation by all the worlds, sung by a brahmin, when he saw an ungrateful person. Listen: 'There is expiation for one who kills a brahmin, a drunkard, a thief and a violator of sacred vows. But there is no atonement for an ungrateful man.' 'O monkey you have already achieved your objective (with the help of Rama) but have not helped Rama in return. You are surely an ignoble and ungrateful liar. 'O monkey, if you are grateful to Rama you should wish to search for Sita. Indeed, you should make efforts to take it up. 'You have failed to keep your word. You are engaged in worldly pleasures. Rama did not know that you are a serpent croaking like a frog. 'Rama is illustrious, compassionate and great. He has granted the kingdom to you, to one who is a sinner and an evilminded person. 'If you do not recognise  the help of Rama who can accomplish any deed with ease, you will be killed with my sharp arrows and meet Vali (in heaven). 'O Sugriva the path by which Vali went is not closed.I wish you do not follow him. You stand by the promise made. 'You have not seen the thunderboltlike arrows released from the bow of Rama, the renowned prince of the Ikshvaku race. Therefore you are resorting to enjoyment without any fear and have not given thought to Rama's work.'       Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, was glowing like fire with his brilliance, thus spoke the moonfaced Tara: 'O Lakshmana you, in particular, should not speak to the king of vanaras in that manner. He does not deserve to hear from your mouth words which are harsh. 'O hero Sugriva, king of monkeys, is not ungrateful or deceitful, He is neither crooked nor false. 'O hero this warrior Sugriva has not forgotten the help rendered by Rama in combat which was difficult (to win). 'O scorcher of enemies it is by Rama's grace that Sugriva has attained fame, the kingdom of monkeys and Ruma and me. 'Sleep did not come to him in deep distress in the past, and now that great happiness has come, he does not realize that it is time to act (search for Sita). He behaves like sage Viswamitra. 'O Lakshmana great sage Visvamitra was in union with an apsara Gritachi for ten years and felt it was just one day indeed 'If the brilliant and the most distinguished of those who knew the value of time did not realise the passing of time, what can be said of an ordinary person? 'O Lakshmana you should pardon him since he is not yet satisfied, though tired, with the struggle for the fulfilment of his sensual pleasures. 'O dear Lakshmana not knowing the true intention of Sugriva, it is not proper for you to be rashly angry like an ordinary man. 'O bull among men men with right vision like you do not become angry instantly without right thinking. 'O Lakshmana, knower of dharma, give up your agitation arising out of great anger. Be composed for the sake of Sugriva. 'I feel Sugriva should (is prepared to) renounce the monkeykingdom, wealth, grains and other treasures and even Ruma and me for the pleasure of Rama. 'Killing Ravana in war, Sugriva will restore Sita soon to Rama.Rama will join Sita like Moon joins Rohini. 'The number of demons in Lanka is reported to be a hundred thousand crore, three lakh, ninetynine thousand and six hundred. (Note: Indian tradition has numbers up to eighteen digits. One hundred thousand crores is equal to a 'mahapadma' which has thirteen digits. The number described here is 1000000399600.) 'It is not possible to kill Ravana who has stolen Sita without killing those unassailable demons who can assume any form at their will. 'O Lakshmana moreover it is not possible for Sugriva alone to kill the wicked Ravana without the help of the monkeys. Vali, the wellinformed lord of the monkeys, has given an account of the demons. The source of the account is not known to me.Therefore I am speaking from what I have heard. 'Monkey chiefs have been sent to bring multitudes of monkey leaders to help you in the battle. 'Sugriva is awaiting the arrival of the powerful and strong vanaras without whose help he cannot accomplish Rama's task.Therefore he has not yet started (the search). 'O Lakshmana since Sugriva has already promulgated an ordinance to all the mighty vanaras, they should be all arriving by now. 'Looking at your angry countenance with bloodred eyes, the wives of  the foremost of monkeys are frightened by the possibility of similar danger of the past (of Vali's death) and do not find peace of mind.'       Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus the gentlenatured Saumitri accepted Tara's courteous words sanctioned by dharma. Sugriva, king of the vanara clan, cast aside his great fear when Lakshmana accepted the words of Tara just as one discards a wet garment from the body. Thereupon Sugriva, relieved from his drunken state tore off the great, colourful valuable garland worn on his neck. Sugriva, the noblest of all monkeys, spoke these polite words in a pleasing manner to Lakshmana of terrific strength: 'O Saumitri my prosperity, fame and the permanent sovereignty of vanaras had been lost. It was  regained by the grace of Rama. 'O crusher of enemies  how is it possible to repay the famous lord Rama's valour (in killing Vali)? 'Righteous Rama can merely restore Sita with my assistance. By his own fiery energy he will kill Ravana. 'Rama shattered seven huge trees, a mountain and earth with a single arrow. What assistance does he need? 'O Lakshmana the twang of his bow shook even the mountains and the earth. What assistance does he need? 'O Lakshmana, bull among men I shall only join him along with others when he leads the army to kill Ravana. 'If I have committed even a little transgression in my faith in Rama or affection for him and exceeded the time limit, my mistakes are to be excused as one would pardons a servant. No one is flawless in the world.' Lakshmana who was happy to hear great Sugriva replied affectionately: 'O Sugriva, king of monkeys when you are extending due courtesy to my brother,he has a guardian in you by all means. 'You are powerful and straightforward by nature.You are humble and noble. Therefore, you deserve the high prosperity of the kingdom of the monkeys. 'O Sugriva with you as associate, valiant hero Rama will kill his enemies in war very soon. There is no doubt about it. 'O Sugriva you know dharma.You are grateful and will not turn back from the battle. So your words are true and befitting. 'O best of monkeys barring you and my elder brother, who else would be capable of speaking this way about themselves even when you are aware of other's faults? 'You who are equal to Rama in valour and strength, will continue to be the gift of gods to us for long. 'Nevertheless I want you to proceed from here with me at once and reassure your friend who is agrieved due to the abduction of his wife.       Thus ends the thirtysix sarga of Kishkindakanda of the Holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

'This is in addition to the monkeys for whom swiftfooted messengers have already been sent. 'Get all the monkeys including those engaged in carnal pleasures and those slow in movement all at once on my command. 'Kill those evilminded ones within ten days for disobeying the royal orders. 'The hundreds of thousands of crores of obedient lionlike monkeys should proceed in all directions at my command. 'Fierce monkeys, comparable to clouds and mountains in appearance shall go as though covering the sky from here at my command. Having heard Sugriva's command, Hanuman, son of the Windgod, sent powerful monkeys in all directions. The monkeys ordered by the king, traversed the pathway of birds and heavenly bodies, the path Lord Visnu had trod. Note: the sky is called Vishnupada since Lord Visnu set his foot on the sky in his incarnation as Vamana. The messenger monkeys drove in all those living on the sea shore, mountains, forests as well as banks of lakes in order to serve the cause of Rama. In response to the command of the king, who was like death to them, the monkeys came at once, driven by fear from Sugriva. Then three crores of swiftfooted monkeys, dark like collyrium, rushed forth to the mountain to meet Rama. Ten crores of monkeys shining like pure molten gold, staying on the best of mountains where the Sun sets moved towards Kishkinda. From the peaks of Kailasa mountain moved out one thousand crores of monkeys who were of bright colour like the lion's mane. Then monkeys residing at mount Himavan feeding on fruits and roots came in thousands of crores. (This number is called Shankha 1000,000,000,000,0, it is one digit higher than Mahapadma.) From the Vindhya mountain came down thousands of crores of swiftfooted monkeys of terrific deeds. They were fierce like fire (Angaraka). The monkeys residents of Tamala forest on the shores of the ocean of milk feeding on coconuts arrived from the groves in countless number. An army of swiftmoving monkeys came from the caves, from the banks of rivers and forests as though it was swallowing up the Sungod. The monkeys sent earlier to hasten all their counterparts saw mount Himavat from the great tree. A divine, wonderful, delightful Yagna dedicated to Lord Siva used to be performed on the beautiful (Himalayan) mountain in the past so that the minds of all deities were satisfied. There the monkeys saw the Yajna, and partook the fruits and roots produced out of the havis which tasted sweet like nectar. Any one who shares even a little of the divine, delicious fruits and roots grown out of that havis will have no hunger or thirst for a month. The monkey leaders who lived on fruits collected the divine fruits, roots as well as  medicinal herbs. The monkeys also collected finesmelling flowers from the sacrificial altar to please Sugriva with. The monkey leaders from all over the earth arrived quickly, leading the hordes of them. In a short while the swiftmoving leaders of the monkeys groups reached Kishkinda quickly. Offering all kinds of medicinal herbs, fruits and roots collected, to Sugriva the monkeys said: On hearing the report from the monkeys, Sugriva the king of vanaras, accepted all the gifts they had brought him, with great pleasure.       Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, of the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On receiving all the gifts presented by the monkeys, Sugriva permitted them to go happy. The monkey heroes sent by Sugriva performed the task assigned to them and felt powerful Rama's task has been achieved (a successful beginning has been made). Cheering Sugriva, the foremost among the monkeys, the mighty Lakshmana said in a humble way: 'O goodnatured Sugriva if you would like to come to Rama let us depart  from Kishkinda. Hearing the gentle words of Lakshmana, spoken lovingly in that manner and asking him to come along with him, Sugriva was highly pleased.He agreed to go with him and said, 'As you please. I abide by your command'. Hearing the gentle words of Lakshmana, spoken lovingly in that manner and asking him to come along with him, Sugriva was highly pleased.He agreed to go with him and said, 'As you please. I abide by your command'. Sugriva spoke to Lakshmana endowed with auspicious signs, and thereupon permitted Tara and other women to leave the place. Sugriva called in the monkeys who deserved audience of the female folk of the royal family. They came forward quickly with folded hands welcoming the heroes. Then seeing the monkeys who had come there, king Sugriva who was shining like the Sungod asked them to get a palanquin ready at once. On hearing the king, the monkeys who were quick to act placed a beautiful palanquin in front of him. Seeing the palanquin placed in front of Sugriva, the chief of the monkeys requested Lakshmana to get in quickly. With this Sugriva, shining like the Sungod, entered along with Lakshmana the golden palanquin carried by ablebodied monkeys. With a pale white umbrella over his head, white yaktail fans and sounds of conches and drums, Sugriva set out receiving greetings from monkeys, rejoicing in his royal glory. With a pale white umbrella over his head, white yaktail fans and sounds of conches and drums, Sugriva set out receiving greetings from monkeys, rejoicing in his royal glory. Surrounded by hundreds of monkeys wielding various sharp weapons, Sugriva went forth to the region where Rama resided Having reached the place where Rama lived, brilliant Sugriva along with Lakshmana descended from the palanquin. Thereafter Sugriva followed by the monkeys approached Rama, and stood with folded hands. Rama was pleased on beholding the great army of monkeys standing, resembling a pond full of lotus buds. Sugriva touched Rama's feet, bending his head down, and Rama lifted him up and embraced him with love and great regard. Embracing him, Rama offered him a seat on the ground and said: 'O best among the heroic monkeys, a king who apportions his time properly towards pursuit of dharma, artha and kama is a hero and deserves to be a king. 'One who neglects dharma and artha and pursues only kama (sensuous enjoyment) is like a man asleep on top of the tree, waking up only to realize that he has fallen down. 'O king of monkeys, slayer of enemies the time to act has arrived. Think of the strategies with your ministers and other monkeys. On hearing this, Sugriva said to Rama,'O longarmed one the fortune, fame and soverignty of vanaras which was lost has been regained only by your grace. On hearing this, Sugriva said to Rama,'O longarmed one the fortune, fame and soverignty of vanaras which was lost has been regained only by your grace. 'O victorious lord he who does not repay the help got through your grace and your brother's is despicable among men. 'O destroyer of enemies hundreds of strong vanara chiefs gathered from all over the earth have reached here. 'O Rama valiant bears of fierce appearance, also golangulas (a variety of monkeys with tails like cows') familiar with the inaccessible fortresses of forest have come. These monkeys are sons of divine beings and gandharvas who can assume any form at will. They are on their way along with their armies.

O scorcher of enemies the vanara troops in hundred thousand crores, ayutas, sanku, arbuda, hundreds of arbudas, madhyas, antyas, samudras and parardhas (100000000000000000), are expected.

'The monkeys who can kill ogre Ravana and his relatives in battle and bring back Maithili will be arriving shortly. The wise statesman, Rama observing the efforts of Sugriva and his attendants looked like a blooming blue lotus through delight.       Thus ends of thirtyeighth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana, composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing Sugriva who stood with folded hands, Rama, the foremost among the upholders of righteousness, hugged him and said: 'O scorcher of enemies, gentle Sugriva it will not be strange if Indra showers rain, if the Sun in the sky dispels darkness with his thousand rays, and if the  Moon cools down the earth with his light, and a person like you helps his friend. 'O scorcher of enemies, gentle Sugriva it will not be strange if Indra showers rain, if the Sun in the sky dispels darkness with his thousand rays, and if the  Moon cools down the earth with his light, and a person like you helps his friend. 'O gentle Sugriva this your help to me is not surprising. You always help your friends and speak in a pleasing manner. 'O friend I will win over all enemies in war supported by you.You are a goodhearted friend and you alone should help me. Just as Anuhlada (son of Hiranyakasipu and brother of Prahlada) took away, Poulomi  (Sachi, daughter of Puloma) deceiving Indra, this lowly demon took away Sita, daughter of the king of Videha. 'I will kill Ravana with my sharp arrows just as Indra, (who had done a hundred sacrifices) killed the proud father of Poulomi. In the mean while the dust raised (by army of monkeys) all over obscured the intense heat from the sky and the radiance of the thousandrayed Sun.

Likewise mighty father of Ruma, fatherinlaw of Sugriva, reached there accompanied by a thousand crore monkeys.

Dhumra, destroyer of enemies, came next followed by two thousand crore of bears of terrible speed. Similarly, the great warrior named Panasa, leader of the troop, reported with three crore dreadful vanaras of the size of huge mountains. Then appeared Nila of huge body, dark like a mountain of collyrium accompanied by ten crore vanaras. Then arrived the leader of five crore vanaras, the great warrior Gavaya who resembled a golden mountain. Then the strong Darimukha, leader of a thousand crore monkeys approached Sugriva. Two very powerful sons of Asvini, Mainda and Dvivida, appeared with a thousand crore vanaras. Strong and powerful Gaja also reached Sugriva with three crore vanaras. Glorious Jambavan, king of bears, stood before Sugriva with ten thousand crore vanaras. Sturdy and victorious vanara called Rumanvan came swiftly followed by a hundred crore vanaras. Then came Gandhamadana with a hundred thousand crore of vanaras following him. Then arrived the heir apparent, Angada, whose prowess is comparable to that of his father with him came a thousand padmas and a hundred sankus of followers. And Tara (brother of Ruma's father) of terrific valour shining like a star showed up at a distance with five crore vanaras. Then Indrajanu the troop leader and chief of vanaras appeared along with eleven crore monkeys. Thereafter Rambha of the colour of the rising Sun brought together an army of one thousand and one hundred ayuta troops. Thereafter the mighty hero, leader of the troop, by name Durmukha appeared with  two crore vanaras. And Hanuman showed up surrounded by a thousand crore vanaras of frightful valour.

All the outstanding vanaras of the earth came and covered the land. The monkeys came leaping, jumping and roaring in enthusiasm and surrounded Sugriva just as clouds surround the Sun. The leaders of monkeys possesing sturdy shoulders made many kinds of noises and reported to Sugriva, bending their heads in reverence. Thereafter the vanaras came close to Sugriva freely and on reaching him stood, offering salutations with folded hands. Sugriva, knower of dharma, at once presented all the prominent vanaras to Rama, and standing with folded hands said. Sugriva told the chiefs to station the forces by the side  of swift mountain streams, in forests, and hills and ascertain their exact number.       Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sugriva, lord of monkeys, who was supported by a massive army informed Rama, the tiger among men and a crusher of the enemy army 'The vanaras living in my kingdom have come and have settled down. They are strong and huge like elephants and they can assume any form at will. 'Dreadful monkeys, powerful monkeys of fierce valour who resemble demons in form, have arrived.

'Dreadful monkeys who resemble demons have arrived along with thousands of fierce fighters. 'O tiger among men announce the proper time for action. This army is at your command. Command them. On hearing him, Rama, Dasaratha's son, hugged Sugriva with his arms and said: 'O wise warrior I wish to know whether Vaidehi is alive or not. Let the kingdom of Ravana be found out. 'On locating Vaidehi in the kingdom of Ravana I shall take up proper course of action  in conjunction with you. 'O lord of monkeys neither I nor my brother Lakshmana should command the monkeys. You are the right person to do it. 'O king you have understood the task to be performed and, therefore, issue orders without the least hesitation. 'You are my second friend (Lakshmana being the first). You are valiant as well as wise. You are aware of timely action. You are interested in my wellbeing. You are capable. You know my purpose. You are a startegic planner'. (The present purpose is to plan the course of action. That is artha. Sugriva knows this artha very well). 'In response to Rama's desire, Sugriva beckoned a troopleader called Vinata who was wellbuilt and lofty like a mountain. And thundering like a cloud, said to him in the presence of Rama and wise Lakshmana: 'O foremost of the vanaras march forward with the sons of Moon and Sun, followed by one lakh swift monkeys towards the eastern direction full of mountains, gardens, and forests.

'The king Sugriva knows for sure that if Hanuman goes forth, success is assured. So he favours him.' The mighty Rama was happy in his heart to see Hanuman. He felt as if the task is achieved. Rama, scorcher of enemies, gladly gave Hanuman a ring inscribed with his name as a mark of identification by princess (Sita). And said: 'O distinguished monkey Janaka's daughter will greet you without any hesitation when you present this signet to her. She will know that you have come from me. 'O great hero your enterprise,  prowess coupled with courage and Sugriva's message to you seem to indicate to me about the success of your mission'. The foremost among the monkeys took the ring given to him, placed it on his forehead and saluated it with folded palms. He then prostrated at the feet of Rama and departed. Like the moon adorned by hosts of stars in the cloudless sky, the mighty heroic Hanuman, the great son of the Windgod, shone in the midst of the army of monkeys. O Hanuman son of the Windgod, O valiant among the Vanaras, I bank on your strength. Do whatever you can with your mighty valour so that the daughter of Janaka can be found.

'The chieftain Sushena, tiger among the monkeys, started quickly for the fearsome western direction ruled by Varuna. Sugriva, chief of the army of monkeys, having sent the leaders to all quarters felt relieved and rejoiced. Addressed thus  by the king, all the monkeys departed quickly from there for their respective directions with all enthusiasm. The powerful monkeys went gallopping and chattering, leaping and screaming. Thus addressed by the king, the leaders of the monkeys shouted, 'We will kill Ravana and get back Sita'. 'I shall kill Ravana singlehanded in war and quickly get back Janaka's daughter churning (the enemy army).' (said one) 'I will alone restore Sita, exhausted and trembling (in fear), even from the nether world. Wait here' (said another leader). 'I will smash trees, shatter mountains, cleave the earth and churn up the seas'. (said a another). 'I can doubtless cross a distance of a hundred yojanas' said one. Another said,' I can leap a hundred yojanas more'.",
                "When the chieftains of the monkeys left, Rama enquired Sugriva, how he had come to know  the regions of the entire earth (which is a mandala. a circular form). Then offering reverential salutation to Rama, Sugriva said, 'I shall narrate in detail. Listen, O bull among men Vali chased the demon Dundubhi in buffalo form into a cave of mount Malaya in order to kill him. Vali chased the demon Dundubhi in buffalo form into a cave of mount Malaya in order to kill him. 'Then I waited at the entrance of the cave with due loyalty. A year passed. Yet Vali did not return. 'There seeing the cave overflowing with the gushing blood, I was bewildered, thinking that my brother might have been killed. I suffered intense agony. 'Thereafter, convinced that my brother was killed, I placed a mountainsize rock at the entrance of the cave so that Dundubhi will be destroyed, unable to come out of the cave. 'I lost hope of his life and came back to Kishkinda. Having got the kingdom, and also Ruma and Tara, I was anointed king and ruled it fearlessly with all friends. 'I lost hope of his life and came back to Kishkinda. Having got the kingdom, and also Ruma and Tara, I was anointed king and ruled it fearlessly with all friends. 'The evilminded Vali, having lost his selfcontrol, ran after me in anger, to kill me and my ministers. I kept running. 'Then I ran in the eastern direction and saw many trees, lakes, rivers and beautiful mountains. 'There I saw, filled with minerals the mountain behind which the Sun rises and the milky ocean frequented by the apsaras. 'O king chased thus by Vali, I ran and turned back and ran againfast. 'Then chased by Vali, I changed my present direction from the east towards the southern quarter where Vindhya mountain stood with its, beautiful sandal trees. 'I was looking at the trees and mountains in the southern direction, I reached the western quarter pursued by Vali. 'Looking at the places around, I reached the best of mountains where the Sun sets (I found Vali still chasing me) and ran towards the north. 'I saw Himavan and mount Meru on the north and the northern sea. Still pursued by Vali, I could not know where to go when wise Hanuman spoke to me these words: 'I remembed Matanga's curse to Vali, king of monkeys. Vali would not enter the site of Matanga's hermitage as his head would break into a hundred pieces if he did'. Therefore  we thought it would be safe for us to reside in that place. 'I remembed Matanga's curse to Vali, king of monkeys. Vali would not enter the site of Matanga's hermitage as his head would break into a hundred pieces if he did'. Therefore  we thought it would be safe for us to reside in that place. 'O prince Rama then I reached mount Rishyamuka which Vali did not enter out of fear of the curse of Matanga. 'O king that way I surveyed the entire earth directly and returned to this cave and lived here.

                "The leaders of vanara troops went fast in all directions to look for Vaidehi following the instructions of  the king of vanaras. They went looking everywhere in the tanks, in the bottom of rivers, in towns, in the sky and similarly in inaccessible rivers, mountains, and forts surrounded by rivers. The troop leaders of the monkeys instructed by Sugriva searched in all places including mountains and forests. The monkeys used to search for Sita all day determinedly and at night assemble at one place. The monkeys would search all day and by night reach for rest the branches of the trees that bear fruits in all seasons. The monkey leaders thus spent a month doing what they did daily and returning disappointed, met the monkey king on mount Prasravana. Having searched for Sita as instructed by  Sugriva, powerful Vinita returned along with the ministers unable to find Sita. Then the great monkey hero Satabali came back from the northern direction along with the army after searching in vain for Sita. Sushena searched for a full month in the western quarter along with the monkeys and returned to report to Sugriva. Sushena came to Sugriva, seated with Rama at Prasravana mountain, offered salutations and spoke: 'We searched for her in the mountains, in inaccessible forests, in rivers and seas and also the countryside. 'We searched for her in the caves, in places filled with extensive vines and huge bushes and in all places mentioned by you. 'We searched again and again the interior, inaccessible and uneven locations,and killed huge animals. We searched in regions difficult to penetrate. 'O king of monkeys we hope, his exhalted highness, the mighty vanara, son of the Windgod, Hanuman has gone in the direction in which Maithili has been carried off. He alone will find Sita and come back.'       Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman, the monkey accompanied by Tara and Angada proceeded as instructed by Sugriva in the (South) direction. He went a long distance with other heroic monkeys, searching in the impenetrable caves of Vindhya mountain. They combed interior places, mountain peaks, fortresses surrounded by rivers, lakes, extensive groves of trees, bushes and thickets. He went a long distance with other heroic monkeys, searching in the impenetrable caves of Vindhya mountain. They combed interior places, mountain peaks, fortresses surrounded by rivers, lakes, extensive groves of trees, bushes and thickets. The heroic monkeys went searching all over the direction for the daughter of Janaka, but in vain. The unassailable monkeys ate roots and fruits and halted here and there at different places searching for Sita. They searched in dense forests, interior locations impassable, desolate and terrific, without water, and people. Having searched all over in the forests and very difficult areas, the fearless, invincible vanaras moved forward, leaving that place and entered another areasearching. As they marched forward, they entered a location where there were trees devoid of leaves, flowers and fruits and rivers without water and a place where it was difficult to get roots (for food). There were no buffaloes, no deer, no elephants, tigers or even  birds and  other wild animals. There were no medicinal plants, no vines or creepers spreading on the ground.The lotus creepers on the dry ground had shining leaves,beautiful and fragrant blooms devoid of bees. There were no medicinal plants, no vines or creepers spreading on the ground.The lotus creepers on the dry ground had shining leaves,beautiful and fragrant blooms devoid of bees. There was a sage called Kandu who was truthful, outrageous and shorttempered. He observed strict austerities and was rich in penance. The great sage was enraged because he had lost his sixteenyearold son in the forest. Cursed by the great righteous sage the entire forest turned barren, unfit to harbour  living beings and became devoid of even beasts and birds. The monkeys searched in the forest regions, in the mountains, rivers and sources of rivers with concentrated attention. Eager to please Sugriva, the great souls searched  in the forest region. Even there they   could not find Janaka's daughter and also Ravana who had abducted Sita. (Then) they noticed a place covered with creepers and bushes. As soon as they entered the dreadful forest, they saw a demon of wicked deeds, unafraid even of gods. The monkeys beheld the dreadful demon standing firmly like a huge, incomparable mountain in front of them. Seeing the monkeys, the infuriated demon ran towards them, raising his fist firmly, saying, 'You are all as good as dead, now that I have caught you.' Mistaking him for Ravana, Angada, Vali's son at once pounced on him and slapped him with his palm. Struck by Vali's son, the demon vomitting blood from the mouth, fell down on the ground like a mountain, uprooted. He breathed his last, and the monkeys who won went searching almost all over the mountain caves. Again they searched the forest and  entered another dreadful mountain cave.",
                "Wise Angada, exhausted after the search, collected the monkeys, and consoling them, said slowly: 'We have searched here, there, everywhere, in dense forests, hills, forts, impenetrable caverns and mountain ranges. But we could find neither Janaki who is like a goddess nor the demon who abducted her. 'We have searched here, there, everywhere, in dense forests, hills, forts, impenetrable caverns and mountain ranges. But we could find neither Janaki who is like a goddess nor the demon who abducted her. 'You should keep searching on till we see Sita, Janaka's daughter, giving up laziness and sorrow and sleep that is overpowering us. 'It is said, zeal, capability, and fortitude can overcome defeat and lead to success. Therefore I am saying this. 'Search this impenetrable forest even now, O you denizens of this forest Give up grief, let us all once again ransack this forest. 'Sugriva, the monkey king, is wrathful and awards severe punishment. We should ever bear in mind the (purpose of the) great self, Rama. 'I have said all this for your good. You may carry it out, if it pleases you. Speak freely if there is any other course left for all of us, O monkeys' Having heard Angada, Gandhamadana worn out by thirst and exhaustion, replied in a feeble tone: 'What Angada says is appropriate, beneficial and also favourable. Carry out his command. 'Once again let us explore the mountains, caverns, forests, desolate places and mountain streams. Once again the  monkeys rose up and started exploring the mountain ranges of Vindhya and the forests surrounding the southern side. Eager to find Sita, the best of monkeys climbed the silver mountain rich with peaks and caverns resembling the autumnal clouds. And looked out into the Lodhra grove and the garden of seven leaves (banara plantations). Eager to find Sita, the best of monkeys climbed the silver mountain rich with peaks and caverns resembling the autumnal clouds. And looked out into the Lodhra grove and the garden of seven leaves (banara plantations). Even after scaling up the peak, the exhausted, heroic monkeys could not find Vaidehi, the dear queen of Rama. Having looked all over the mountain and many caverns, those monkeys got down from the mountain. Descending to the foothills, the exhausted monkeys became quiet. Fatigued and disheartened, they assembled under a tree, stood for a moment and then lay down. Resting for a while, the frustrated monkeys resumed their search throughout the southern direction. The bulls among vanaras and Hanuman, the chief of the group again started exploring  everywhere in the Vindhya range starting from the beginning.

                "Hanuman, together with the monkeys, Tara and Angada, searched in the impenetrable places and caves of Vindhya. They also searched near rivers, mountain streams, hill ranges, caves of lions and tigers, in the rock shelters and difficult spots of vast mountains. They reached the end of the southwest side of the mountain(Vindhya). While they were still there, the time stipulated for them (to find Sita) had slipped. The son of the Windgod, Hanuman, searched all over the mountains and caves and woods difficult to access in that southwestern region of the mountain. Having explored the region surrounded by a network of mountains, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Mainda and also Dvivida, Sushena, Jambavan, Angada the heir apparent, Tara the forestdweller staying close to one another and Hanuman too not far from the others searched in the southern direction.

While  they were exploring, they saw the mouth of a large cave called Rikshabilam, which had its mouth open,  guarded by a demon. Overcome with hunger and thirst, the exhausted monkeys noticed a huge cave covered with creepers and bushes, while they were looking around for water. Just then, the kraunchas, swans, geese and chakravaka drenched in water with their limbs reddened with the pollen of lotuses were fluttering out (of the cave). The bulls among the monkeys were bewildered when they reached the cave which was difficult to access. The brilliant host of monkeys experienced both fear and joy to see the cave difficult to enter. The cave was crowded with creatures of different kinds. It looked like the abode of the king of demons difficult (to enter), dreadful and impenetrable. Then Hanuman, son of the Windgod who appeared like a huge mountain and knew about forests spoke to the fellowmonkeys: 'Going round the places covering all mountain ranges in the southern direction, we are spent. But we could not see Maithili. 'From this cave have emerged several birds like sarasas, swans, kraunchas and chakravakas drenched in water. Surely there must be a source of plenty of water or well or a pond. Moreover there are shining( green) trees at the entrance of the cave (suggesting subsoil water).' 'From this cave have emerged several birds like sarasas, swans, kraunchas and chakravakas drenched in water. Surely there must be a source of plenty of water or well or a pond. Moreover there are shining( green) trees at the entrance of the cave (suggesting subsoil water).' On hearing him, the monkeys entered the cave full of darkness. There was no light of the Moon or the Sun. It was a horripilating experience. The tigers among the monkeys entered the dark cave reverberating with the sounds of lions, beasts and birds. The monkeys could not fix their eyes anywhere.Their lustre or valour could not help them. They moved like wind uninterrupted and their vision was lost in darkness. As the elephantlike monkeys entered the cave quickly, they saw bright light and an excellent delightful place. Holding one another's hands, they went in for a distance of one  yojana inside the cave that was densely covered with several kinds of trees. Having nearly lost their senses (without water to drink), the thirsty and bewildered monkeys were desperate for water.They wandered in the cave without feeling lazy for some time. Exhausted and enfeebled, they saw with dejected faces a gleam of light at a time when they were desparate. Having reached inside the cave the monkeys saw a forest shining like blazing fire, dispelling the surrounding darkness. There they noticed sala, tala, tamala, punnaga, vanjjula, dhava, champaka, and naga trees. They also saw blossoming plants of Karnikara, bunches of beautiful golden flowers and tender redcoloured leaves.They saw wonderful trees with creepers on top entwining them, and ornamented with gold  (like golden fruits), radiant like the dazzling rising Sun. There were altars encrusted with precious sapphire and vaidurya. The golden trees were shining bright. There were lotus creepers looking like sapphire and vaidurya.The ponds were filled with golden lotuses and were surrounded by birds.

The monkeys marked here and there a collection of gold, glittering like blazing fire. While searching here and there in the cave, the strong and powerful monkeys discovered a woman not far from there. She was an ascetic in bark robes and deer skin blazing with lustre, restrained in her food. The monkeys got very frightened. The amazed monkeys stopped there. Hanuman enquired, 'Who are you? Whose cave is this'? Then Hanuman who was of the size of a mountain greeted the old lady with folded hands and enquired her 'Who are you? To whom does this mansion, this cave and these gems belong?'       Thus ends of fiftieth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic of the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On meeting the distinguished, righteous ascetic woman robed in deer skin, Hanuman said: 'We are exhausted with thirst and hunger. We are fatigued. (Hence) we entered this dark cave all at once(without waiting for permission). 'Thirst drove us into this cave on earth. We are amazed at the kind of many wonderful objects here and have nearly lost our senses. We are tormented with pain. 'To whom do these golden trees resembling the rising Sun belong?

The noble ascetic committed to the welfare of all beings replied to Hanuman's enquiry: 'O bull among monkeys this golden forest was created by the magical power of a deceitful demon called Maya. This best of wonderful mansions has been constructed earlier by Visvakarma, the chief (architect) of the demons. 'He (Maya) performed rigorous penance in the dense forest for thousands of years seeking the favour of Brahma, the creator and obtained a boon that he should inherit all the wealth of Usanas (Shukra). Then the mighty Maya who received the power of (executing) desires created this mansion and lived here happily for some time in this dense forest. 'Seeing this great demon in love with a heavenly apsara (nymph) called Hema, Lord Indra with all his might attacked him with his thunderbolt. 'Thus this wonderful forest and the golden house with all luxury were given away permanently to Hema by the creator Brahma. 'O best of monkeys daughter of Meru Sauvarni, I am Svayamprabha (selfilluminator), caretaker of this house of Hema. (Meru Sauvarni is the eleventh  Manu). 'Hema, wellversed in dance and music is a fast friend to me. She granted a boon (that none can resist me) and gave this house of which I am the caretaker. 'What is your mission? For what purpose have you come to this inaccessible forest? What are you looking for?How did you find this? 'Eat these wonderful roots and fruits and have these drinks and then tell me all about you.

                "After the monkey leaders had taken rest, the noble ascetic with undiverted attention said these words: 'O monkeys if you have been relieved of your fatigue after eating fruits, now tell me about yourself, if you think it can be told. I want to hear. When Hanuman, son of the Windgod, heard her, he started narrating frankly and truthfully.

'Then while we were looking around we saw this cave concealed by trees and vines, with darkness spread all over. 'Drenched in water the swans, kuraras, and sarasas were seen emerging with water dripping from thier wings. 'I suggested to the fellowmonkeys to enter this cave, inferring that there would be water and all of them came to the same conclusion. 'We said, 'let us enter', since we were in a hurry to carry out our king's orders.Then we jumped in, holding one another's hand. 'Vexed and starved, we entered this grotto shrouded in darkness.This is our task and we reached here (in the process). 'You have given us roots and fruits out of hospitality and we have been taken them driven by hunger and thirst. 'We were dying from hunger when you saved us. Tell us what the monkeys can do to repay your debt?'. To the leaders among the monkeys, knowers of dharma, who said this Svayamprabha replied: 'I am very much pleased with all of you, smart monkeys. As I am engaged in the practice of righteousness, I do not need your services.       Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "To the auspicious words of the righteous, blameless hermitess Hanuman replied: 'You are a righteous lady. You have given us refuge. Now in moving about the cave we have exceeded the time limit given by Sugriva.' 'O righteous lady we have a great task waiting. We are afraid of Sugriva as we could not accomplish our objective by staying here. Save us.' 'O righteous lady we have a great task waiting. We are afraid of Sugriva as we could not accomplish our objective by staying here. Save us.' To the words of Hanuman the ascetic replied, 'I consider it difficult for any one who enters here to go back alive.' 'I will help all monkeys out of this cave by virtue of my power of asceticism duly practised. Happy at the prospect of getting out (of the cave) they all not only closed their eyes but also covered them with their delicate fingers. Then the great monkeys, faces covered with their hands, emerged from the cave in a moment. The righteous hermitess released all the monkeys out of that difficult situation and said these words of consolation: 'This Vindhya mountain has a rich collection of trees and bushes. This is Prasravana hill and this is the great ocean.O monkeys. Good luck to you. (Now) I am going back home'. Having said so, Svayamprabha entered the splendid cave. 'This Vindhya mountain has a rich collection of trees and bushes. This is Prasravana hill and this is the great ocean.O monkeys. Good luck to you. (Now) I am going back home'. Having said so, Svayamprabha entered the splendid cave. Then the monkeys saw the boundless, dreary ocean roaring wild with its terrific waves spread all over. While they were ransacking the impassable mountain created with the magical powers of Maya, the time limit of one month set by the king was over. Then the highsoul monkeys reached the hill adjacent to Vindhya mountain on which trees were in full bloom.They sat there, lost in thought. Alarmed at the thought (of transgression of time limit), the monkeys kept looking at the tree tops entwined with a hundred oreepers heavily loaded with the flowers of spring. Having realised (looking at the flowers) that spring has set in and they have exceeded the time limit, they all fell down on the ground. Coming to a conclusion after due deliberation Angada, heir apparent, profoundly wise, endowed with sturdy and broad shoulders like those of a lion or a bull, spoke in a sweet voice to the elderly, respectable monkeys, dwellers of the forest: Coming to a conclusion after due deliberation Angada, heir apparent, profoundly wise, endowed with sturdy and broad shoulders like those of a lion or a bull, spoke in a sweet voice to the elderly, respectable monkeys, dwellers of the forest: 'O monkeys don't you realize that all of us have come here at the command of the monkey king, and while we were in the cave a whole month has gone by? 'We started our journey in the month of Ashvayuja with a certain time limit. That has exceeded. What is the future course of action? 'You are all celebrated for bravery and incomparable in your activities. You have followed me in obedience to the orders of the tawnyeyed Sugriva. 'We should be killed since we have failed to achieve the objective (of finding Sita). There is no doubt about it. Who can live in peace without executing the orders of the king? 'Now that the time limit fixed by Sugriva has expired, the right thing to do for the monkeys is to fast unto death. 'By nature Sugriva is harsh, and being a king now, he will not forgive us who are real offenders and have not done the task assigned. 'Surely the king will torture us by awarding death sentence in a singular manner when we go back. It is better for us to meet death here itself. 'I was not installed as heir apparent by Sugriva. I was made crowned prince by king Rama, the king of the people who never hurts others. 'The Monkeyking nursed bitter enmity against me even earlier. Now seeing my lapse, he will decidedly inflict severe punishment on me. 'I do not want my friends to see my calamity, my death. I shall sit here on the sacred shores of this ocean and await my death'. Hearing the young heir apparent thus speaking, the best of the monkeys kindly responded: 'By nature Sugriva is harsh. Rama is devoted to his wife. Therefore, if Sugriva sees that we have not found Vaidehi and have returned (without fulfilling the mission) he will award death sentence to us in order to please Rama.There is no doubt. 'By nature Sugriva is harsh. Rama is devoted to his wife. Therefore, if Sugriva sees that we have not found Vaidehi and have returned (without fulfilling the mission) he will award death sentence to us in order to please Rama.There is no doubt. 'Those who have failed in their mission, being offenders should not go to meet the king. Offenders are not forgiven. Here itself we will search for Sita and if we are able to know her whereabouts we will go back. Or else we will go to the abode of Yama'. 'On hearing the words of the frightened monkeys, Tara said, 'Enough of this sorrow. If it pleases you, we will all go to the cave and reside there' '' 'This cave built by magic is inaccessible. It has a number of trees, water, eatables and drinks. (If we live here) we need not be afraid of even Indra, the breaker of enemy citadels or even of Rama or also of the king of monkeys'. All the monkeys agreed to the favourable suggestion of Tara which was acceptable to Angada. 'A plan may be made in such a way by which we will not be killed by the king. Our strategy should be delinked from the conditions laid down by the king. Let us not face punishment' said the monkeys.

Hanuman proceeded to win over Angada, who was ever shining in strength and valour, who was growing in majesty constantly like the Moon in the bright fornight, whose intellectual prowess was equal to that of Brhaspati, who was equal to his father in valour and who was wellversed in all sastras. Angada was listening toTara like Indra listened to Sukra (preceptor of the demons). Resorting to the third strategy out of the four ways of achieving an objective Hanuman created differences among the monkeys with skilful arguments. (Sama, Dana, Bheda and Danda are the four means. Hanuman adopted Bheda as a means of winning over an enemy). When there were differences among the monkeys over the issue, Hanuman intimidated Angada with frightening words expressing his anger, using skilful arguments: 'O Son of Tara you are, indeed, very efficient like your father in combat. You can hold firmly the responsibilty of the vanara kingdom like your father. 'O leader among  monkeys Vanaras are always fickleminded. Being away from their sons and wives they will not always carry out your command and stay here forever. 'This  I am telling you openly and frankly. These monkeys are not going to be obedient to you. Neither Jambavan, nor Nila nor the great monkey Suhotra nor even myself would subscribe to this opinion (of staying in the cave) and follow you. It is not possible for you to keep us or these monkeys from Sugriva through the policy of appeasement like Sama, Dana, Bheda or even Danda (persuasion, giving gifts, creating differences or imposing punishment).

It is not possible for you to keep us or these monkeys from Sugriva through the policy of appeasement like Sama, Dana, Bheda or even Danda (persuasion, giving gifts, creating differences or imposing punishment). 'It is said that when a strong man fights a weak one, the weak opponent should adopt the strategy of asana (watching) for selfprotection. The weak should not enter into combat with the strong. 'You may think it safe to stay here in this opening of the earth. It is a petty task for the arrows of Lakshmana to break open this socalled cave. 'In the past Indra had done a small damage (to the cave) with his thunderbolt. But with his sharp arrows Lakshmana will shatter the cave easily as though it is a leaf cup. 'Lakshmna has many such iron arrows that are equal to the thunderbolt. They can even split the mountains. 'O scorcher of enemies the moment you decide to establish yourself here, all these monkeys will surely desert you. 'The memory of their sons and wives will haunt these hungry monkeys. The inconvenient bed will make them so depressed that they will leave you behind. 'Left out of your friends and relatives,who are your wellwishers, you will be very frightened even by the trembling of a blade of grass. In Progress 'It is not that Lakshmana's dreadful arrows flying at great speed will not torture you. It will be difficult for you to avert them as they are eager to kill an escaping enemy. 'If along with us you approach Sugriva in a humble manner he will make you his successor to the kingdom. 'Your father's brother is virtuous, wellintentioned, loving, steadfast in action, and true to his promise. He will not kill you.",
                "On hearing Hanuman's humble words (of advice) consistent with righteousness and full of devotion to his master, the king, Angada said: 'Sugriva has no steadfastness, purity of body and mind, compassion, rectitude, valour and patience. 'He usurped his elder brother's queen, while he was still alive. It is morally abominable since an elder brother's wife is like a mother. How can a person who blocks the entrance of a cave while his noble brother is engaged in fighting inside be treated as righteous? 'He usurped his elder brother's queen, while he was still alive. It is morally abominable since an elder brother's wife is like a mother. How can a person who blocks the entrance of a cave while his noble brother is engaged in fighting inside be treated as righteous? 'Illustrious Rama, who faithfully held his hand was forgotten after he received his help. Indeed whose help would he remember? 'Sugriva ordered search for Sita out of fear of Lakshmana and not out of fear of unrighteousness. How can such a man be pious? 'He is a sinner and an ungrateful person as he does not remember others' help. He is fickleminded. Which respectable person will believe him? Which member of his family will wish to live? 'If I am the king's son, virtuous or otherwise, I will be installed in the kingdom (as successor). How can Sugriva suffer me to live when I am his enemy's descendant? 'My alternate strategy has failed. I have already made a mistake (by announcing my plan). My advisors are holding different views. I am powerless. How can a weakling, an orphan like me live in Kishkinda? 'Sugriva is deceitful, cruel and treacherous. He will inflict secret punishment on me by way of imprisonment for the sake of the kingdom. 'It is better for me to fast unto death rather than suffer imprisonment. Permit me to do so. You may all go back. 'I swear I will not return to the city. I will fast unto death here only. Death for me is desirable. 'Convey my greetings with due courtesy to Rama and Lakshmana on my behalf and my respects to my father's younger brother, king of monkeys, Sugriva and wish him well. 'You should convey my mother as well as Ruma my good wishes for their health and wellbeing. You should console my mother Tara also. 'By nature my mother, is compassionate. She is fond of me. (But) she is helpless. On hearing about my death, she will certainly give up her life'. Having expresed so much of his feelings, disheartened Angada saluted the elderly monkeys and started crying. Then he spread the darbha grass and lay down on the ground. Seeing him lie down the bulls among the monkeys became sad and shed hot tears from their eyes. Blaming Sugriva and praising Vali, all the companions of Angada sat there surrounding him after having decided to fast unto death . With the opinion of Vali's son ascertained, all the great monkeys thought it proper to die. They sipped water and assembled on the northern shore of the sea facing the east with the darbha grass spread on the ground, their edges pointing southward.

While the monkeys were preparing to fast unto death on the plateau of the mountain, Sampati, the prosperous king of vultures, the longlived elder brother of Jatayu widely known for his strength, appeared there. Coming out of the cave of the great mount Vindhya, Sampati was glad to see the monkeys seated there and said to himself: 'Destiny rules the world of men in accordance with a divine arrangement. Or else, it would not have brought me food after a long time (of fasting)'. (The monkeys are food for Sampati)' Looking at them, the vulture continued, 'I will eat these monkeys one after the other as and when they die'. Hearing the words of the vulture greedily waiting for food, deeply dejected Angada spoke to Hanuman: 'See, Yama, son of Vaivasvata, has arrived here in person  to destroy the monkeys in the name of Sita. (Sita became the direct agent for causing the destruction of monkeys). 'Rama's task has not been performed. Sugriva's order has not been excuted. And (now) suddenly this calamity has overtaken the monkeys unawares. 'We have heard in detail about the task accomplished by Jatayu, the king of vultures, in order to please Sita, the princess of Videha. 'Bound by  friendship and compassion each one helps the other. In fact, Jatayu did this by giving up his life on his own, for the sake of Rama. 'Jatayu, the knower of dharma, has laid down his life for the wellbeing of Rama. We are exhausted in the process of helping Rama. We have lost hope of our lives after entering these forests. Yet we have failed to find the princess from Mithila. 'The king of vultures was slain by Ravana in a combat. He attained supreme status. He had no fear for Sugriva (as we have). 'The survival of monkeys has become doubtful due to the death of Jatayu, death of  king Dasaratha and the abduction of the princess from Videha. 'The exile of Rama and Lakshmana into the forest along with Sita, so also the death of Vali and of the demons in the hands of Rama due to his anger are all evil consequences of a boon granted to Kaikeyi.' 'The exile of Rama and Lakshmana into the forest along with Sita, so also the death of Vali and of the demons in the hands of Rama due to his anger are all evil consequences of a boon granted to Kaikeyi.' The wise king of vultures was shaken up mentally on seeing the monkeys lying on the ground and hearing the unhappy narration of Angada.       Thus ends the  fiftysixth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the words that came from Angada's mouth, the sharpbeaked, loudvoiced vulture (Sampati) said: 'Who is it that was Pronouncing loudly the death of my dearest brother Jatayu? This news has shaken my mind. 'I heard my brother's name today after a long time.I wish to know how the demon and the vulture fought at Janasthana. 'I wish to be brought down from this inaccessible mountain peak by all of you. I am glad to have heard from you the name of my younger brother after a long time. He is virtuous, valiant and praiseworthy. 'O bulls among monkeys I desire to hear about the death of my brother Jatayu, who was dwelling at Janasthana. 'How did Dasaratha develop friendship with my brother? I hear that Rama who is the favourite firstborn of Dasaratha has endeared himself to all elders. 'O tamers of foes as my wings are burnt down by the Sun's rays it is not possible for me to move forward. I wish you help me to get down from this mountain'. The leaders among monkeys did not trust his words even though his voice was choked with grief. They suspected his intentions. On seeing the vulture, the monkeys fasting unto death got a terrible thought in their minds that the vulture might eat them. 'Since we wish to die, we will be accomplishing our objective successfully if he eats us soon'. Thus thought the chief among the monkeys. Angada having helped the vulture come down the mountain peak, said: 'O powerful bird my revered grandfather Riksharaja was a glorious king of monkeys. He had two sons called Sugriva and Vali.Both were strong like floodwaters. My father Vali was wellknown in this world for his remarkable deeds.

'Jatayu destroyed Ravana's aerial chariot and put Maithili in a (safe) place. But being old and exhausted, he was killed in a combat by Ravana. 'Thus the vulture was slain by Ravana who was stronger. Cremated by Rama and his last rites performed, he reached the supreme heavenly abode. (It was the luck of Jatayu, unlike Dasaratha, to be cremated by Rama.) 'Then Rama made friendship with my father's brother, great self Sugriva and killed my father.",
                "On hearing the pathetic words from the monkeys who had given up hope of life, the loudvoiced vulture wailing replied: 'O monkeys, the one you said to have been killed by mighty Ravana in a combat was  my younger brother, Jatayu. 'Even after I have heard this, I cannot avenge my brother's death as I am old, I have no wings, and I have no energy enough (to fight). 'In olden days, when Indra killed Vrutra we (Jatayu and I) seeking to challenge him reached the Sun blazing with a garland of beams. 'Flying in the sky at a violently high speed, we reached the meridian of the Sun when, unable to bear the heat, Jatayu became weak. 'Seeing my brother tormented due to the Sun's radiance I was overwhelmed with grief. Out of love I covered him with both my wings. 'O bulls among monkeys, consequently my wings were burnt and I dropped down on Vindhya. Here I have been living, knowing not my brother's whereabouts.' To these words of Jatayu's brother, Sampati, Angada, the learned heir apparent replied: 'I have heard you. If you are the brother of Jatayu, tell us about the abode of that demon if you know. 'Tell us about Ravana, king of the demons who is unaware of the consequences. If you know his residence, tell us if it is near or far.' Then Jatayu's elder brother, the glorious Sampati, said these pleasing, befitting words: 'O monkeys I am a vulture. My wings are burnt and my strength is depleted. The only substantial help I can render Rama is through my words. 'I know Varuna's worlds(seas and oceans) and all the three worlds measured by three  strides  by Vamana. Indeed I also know about the friction between the great gods and demons and the churning of the ocean for nectar. 'Rama's work is my primary duty. (But) my strength is drained by age and I have lost my vitality. 'I saw a young lady of beautiful appearance, adorned with all kinds of ornaments  borne away by the evilminded Ravana. That dainty lady was calling out, 'O Rama,  O Lakshmana' and was crying aloud. She was throwing away her ornaments and was wriggling to get out of Ravana's grip.

'Her fine silk garment was shining like the radiance of the Sun on the mountain peak, like lightning against the dark cloud. (That was Ravana). 'Since she was uttering Rama's name I think she is Sita. (Now) I will tell you about the demon's abode. Listen 'He is Vishrava's son and halfbrother of Vaishravana. His name is Ravana and he resides in the city of Lanka. 'The beautiful city of Lanka is an island, a hundred yojanas away from here.It was built by Visvakarma. 'The city has golden gates, golden platforms, huge, goldencoloured, uniformly built mansions surrounded by a tall boundary wall of the colour of sunlight.

For those fighting on foot, the movement is restricted to the extent of foot movement. 'Look out for some means to cross the salty ocean. You will see Vaidehi, and return, your mission accomplished. 'Take me to the ocean, the abode of Varuna. I intend to offer oblation to my brother, a great soul who is in heaven.'

                "The mighty monkeys were delighted to hear the nectarlike words of the king of vultures. Jambavan the king of bears got up at once from the ground along with the monkeys and spoke to the king of vultures: 'Where is Sita now? By whom else was she seen while being carried? Pray, tell us everything. You are the ultimate saviour of monkeys. 'Who is not aware of Rama's swift arrows which are like thunderbolt? Who is not able to assess the speed and power of arrows of Lakshmana released directly?' Pleased to see the happiness and eagernes of the monkeys assembled to hear about Sita, Sampati continued in order to reassure them: 'Now hear by whom I was informed about the abduction of the largeeyed princess from Videha and where she is at present. 'With my vitality and prowess depleted, I have been staying for a long time on this mountain, extended by several yojanas and inaccessible. 'Reduced to this state, I have been maintained by food given in time by my son named Suparshva, best among birds. 'Gandharvas have intense passion. Serpents show violent anger. Deer have great fear. And we vultures have great hunger. 'Once my son came to me without meat after sunset while I was feeling hungry for food. 'I was thinking, tormented with hunger, my son who always keeps me happy told me exactly what had happened: 'O dear father I went to get food at the right time and stood blocking the entrance of mount Mahendra. 'There I stood alone  looking down, obstructing the path of thousands of creatures inhabiting the ocean. 'I saw a person who was dark and huge like a mass of collyrium carrying a lady whose radiance was like the rising Sun. 'Since I was looking for food I resolved to seize both of them. (But) he asked me in a gentle and courteous manner to make way (since I was blocking the aerial path). 'Who will strike polite people? Even the mean do not do it anywhere. And what to speak of me. 'He flew hurriedly with splendour as though he was enveloping the sky (making it small). All the flying creatures in the sky came and greeted me with respect. 'I heard the great sages saying, 'O dear you are lucky to be saved. He has somehow gone from here with that lady (without hurting you). Undoubtedly you are lucky.' 'I was greeted by the most illustrious siddhas. I came to know from them that he was Ravana, the king of demons. I was looking at him while he was abducting Janaka's daughter, who was the wife of Dasaratha's Rama. Her ornaments had dropped and silken robes had slipped since she lost hold on herself. She was crying, loudly calling out the names of Rama and Lakshmana, her hair dishevelled. 'I was greeted by the most illustrious siddhas.

                "Sampati bathed and offered libations to Jatayu. Then all the monkeys sat round him on the beautiful mountain. Angada sat near Sampati surrounded by all monkeys. Sampati who had gained confidence spoke to Angada  once again joyously. 'O monkeys I shall tell you in detail how I came to know the princess from Mithila. Listen quietly with rapt attention: Scorched by the rays of the Sun, I was burnt totally and fell on the peak of this mount Vindhya years ago. 'Then I looked at the oceans, the mountains, rivers, lakes, forests and all locations and  my memory returned gradually. 'I came to know then that this place is inhabited by flocks of happy birds and full of many caves and mountain peaks. This is mount Vindhya on the shore of the southern ocean. 'There was a hermitage nearby, where a revered sage, who was even worshpped by gods  lived. His name was Nishakara. He did rigorous penance here. 'O righteous monkeys after the death of sage Nishakara eight thousand years have passed. And I have been living here. 'I descended down slowly from the high rugged peak of the Vindhya mountain with great difficulty to the plain land bristling with sharp, harsh darbha grass. 'Eager to see the great sage I reached the place with much difficulty. I and my brother Jatayu had  approached him many a time earlier. 'In the vicinity of that hermitage there was no tree without flowers or fruits and fragrant was the breeze that blew around. 'On reaching the sacred hermitage, I stood and waited under a tree for the audience of the divine sage Nishakara. 'He was followed by bears, deer, tigers, lions, elephants and snakes just as living beings follow their creator. 'Just as the army including feudatories recede, when the king comes, all those creatures repaired to their dens when they knew the arrival of the sage at the hermitage. The sage who entered the hermitage came out again within a moment on seeing me and enquired about me affectionately: 'O gentle one seeing your body devoid of hair I can understood that your wings have been burnt and your body bruised. 'You are the king among vultures equal to wind in speed.I had seen both the brothers earlier and both of you could change your form at will. 'What disease has affected you? Why are your wings dropped down? Who punished you in this way? Tell me.'       Thus ends the sixtieth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",

'O revered sage I am exhausted and my senses are depressed. I am ashamed of myself. My body is wounded. Therefore I am not able to reply. 'Deluded by pride, I and my brother Jatayu challenging each other to test our relative strength flew  far into the sky. 'Both of us made a bet on the peak of mount Kailasa in the presence of sages to follow the Sungod until he sets on the western mountain. 'And from there both of us looked at all the cities on the land which seemed like the size of chariot wheels one after the other. 'We heard at some places sounds of musical instruments, sounds of Vedic chanting, and many lovely young women dressed in redsinging. 'We flew quickly into the sky and reached the path of the Sun and looked down at the forest which looked like a green lawn. 'The earth filled with lofty mountains appeared as if it is covered with pebbles. Surrounded by rivers meandering, it looked as though it was entwined with threads. 'The mountains of the earth, Himavan and Vindhya and the great Meru looked like huge elephants in a huge pond. 'Much sweat, pain and fear generated in us while we went on and up. This led to terrific confusion and stupor. 'I did not know which the southern direction was or the southeast or the west. It looked as if the world had been consumed by fire and dissolved, as if it was the end of the yuga. 'My mind was disturbed and I turned my attention from the object. Once again I focused my attention (on the Sun) and could see the Sungod with great effort. The Sun appeared to us equal in size to earth.

Even as he was telling this to the monkeys his wings started appearing in their presence. He experienced an unparalleled delight seeing wings with red feathers growing on his body, and said to the monkeys: 'By the grace of the most revered soul,sage Nishakara, both my wings that were burnt by the Sun's radiance have grown again.

On hearing the words of Sampati, the monkeys felt glad and, eager to see Sita, reached the ocean, the passage to the abode of Ravana. Having reached the ocean, the monkeys, endowed with frightening courage, stood looking at the vast ocean which appeared like an image of the whole world. Powerful and heroic monkeys assembled at the northern end of the southern ocean. The ocean was of terrifying form filled with various violent species of grotesque creatures of huge bodies playing in the water. Full of violent tides, it appeared asleep at one place and apparently sporting in another. In some places it was rising as high as a mountain with huge volumes of water. It was as if roaring with the demon chiefs residing in the underworld. The great monkeys were worried seeing the huge ocean which created horripilation in them. The ocean was of terrifying form filled with various violent species of grotesque creatures of huge bodies playing in the water.

It was as if roaring with the demon chiefs residing in the underworld. The great monkeys were worried seeing the huge ocean which created horripilation in them. All the monkeys were worried when they suddenly saw the ocean which looked impassable like the sky. They wondered if they can at all accomplish the task (of finding Sita) Angada, the best among the monkeys saw the worried army despondent gazing at the ocean, and comforted the frightened troops. Angada,the strong and wise  son of Vali, spoke thus to the tensed vanaras in the right time: 'Do not be despondent. It is the biggest flaw. It destroys a person like an angry serpent killing a young child. 'If one succumbs to despondency while he has to exhibit his valour, his brilliance gets diminished and he does not succeed in his manly pursuits'. With the night over, Angada joined the older monkeys again and sought their counsel. The army of monkeys encircled Angada like the army of Maruts surrounding Indra. Who else other than the son of Vali and Hanuman can resist and pacify the monkeyarmy? Then the illustrious Angada, subduer of foes took the counsel of elderly monkeys and  the army into confidence and thus addressed them all in meaningful words: 'Now which mighty monkey will cross the ocean? Who will prove Sugriva, subduer of enemies, true to his promise? 'O monkeys which one can leap a hundred yojanas and liberate the monkey leaders from the great fear of Sugriva? 'By whose effort can we be successful and return home happily from here to meet wives and sons? 'By whose grace shall we approach Rama and Lakshmana and even the monkey king Sugriva happily? 'If there is any one among you who is capable of leaping  across the ocean he will be giving all of us the sacred gift of life quickly?' After hearing Angada, no one spoke a word. The entire army of monkeys became still and motionless. Angada, the best of the monkeys again addressed them saying, 'you are all mighty, eminent and courageous, born in renowned families and have been honoured again and again(for your actions). 'None of you at any time have faced any obstruction in doing your deeds. You are efficient  in leaping. O bulls among monkeys now speak out, who among you can fly and how far?       Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, on hearing Angada, all the leaders among the monkeys, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Mainda, Dvivida, Sushena and Jambavan as well expressed one after  the other their capability for leaping. Thereafter, on hearing Angada, all the leaders among the monkeys, Gaja, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Mainda, Dvivida, Sushena and Jambavan as well expressed one after  the other their capability for leaping. Gaja said he can leap ten yojanas and Gavaksha said he can go upto twenty yojanas. Then Gavaya said to the monkeys 'I can leap thirty yojanas Sarabha said 'I can leap forty yojanas' bright Ghandhamadana said 'I can leap as far as fifty yojanas without any doubt' Mainda said 'I can leap more than sixty yojanas' highly brilliant Dvivida said in turn, 'I can no doubt leap seventy yojanas ' brilliant and best of the monkeys Sushena declared 'I can leap across eighty yojanas'. Then Gavaya said to the monkeys 'I can leap thirty yojanas Sarabha said 'I can leap forty yojanas' bright Ghandhamadana said 'I can leap as far as fifty yojanas without any doubt' Mainda said 'I can leap more than sixty yojanas' highly brilliant Dvivida said in turn, 'I can no doubt leap seventy yojanas ' brilliant and best of the monkeys Sushena declared 'I can leap across eighty yojanas'. Then Gavaya said to the monkeys 'I can leap thirty yojanas Sarabha said 'I can leap forty yojanas' bright Ghandhamadana said 'I can leap as far as fifty yojanas without any doubt' Mainda said 'I can leap more than sixty yojanas' highly brilliant Dvivida said in turn, 'I can no doubt leap seventy yojanas ' brilliant and best of the monkeys Sushena declared 'I can leap across eighty yojanas'. Then Gavaya said to the monkeys 'I can leap thirty yojanas Sarabha said 'I can leap forty yojanas' bright Ghandhamadana said 'I can leap as far as fifty yojanas without any doubt' Mainda said 'I can leap more than sixty yojanas' highly brilliant Dvivida said in turn, 'I can no doubt leap seventy yojanas ' brilliant and best of the monkeys Sushena declared 'I can leap across eighty yojanas'.

When the monkeys were talking (of their individual capacity) in that manner about their speed, Jambavan the oldest of the monkeys inferred (their capacity) and said: 'Earlier I was also very courageous, but now I have become old and reached the fag end of life. 'However  in this situation, it is not possible for us to neglect (our task) as it is the order of the monkeyking and Rama who are determined to achieve the objective. Jambavan, the distinguished among the monkeys again said, 'My strength to leap into the sky was not only that much (I was stronger in my youth and could cover longer distances)' 'In the past, at the time of the wellknown yagna (of king Bali) I was very strong. I circumambulated the eternal Vishnu while he was taking three strides (in his incarnation of Trivikrama Vamana.) 'Having grown old I do not have the same courage. In my youth my prowess was incomparable and none could excel me. 'I guess that at this time I do not have the capacity to fly to that extent. Achieving the objective is out of question with this much of energy. 'Then the wise Angada said to great Jambavan, in a gentle manner about his  own strength. 'I can  certainly go to a distance of a hundred yojanas. However, I cannot say whether I will have enough capacity to return? Jambavan who was skilful in speech spoke to that great Angada, 'O leader among monkeys and bears your energy to cover this distance is wellknown to us'. 'You can go upto even a hundred thousand yojanas and have the required energy to return also. But it is not proper to send you (because you are the heir apparent). 'O scorcher of enemies, you are established as the commander of the army and it is proper for us to protect you as we protect our wives. 'O subduer of enemies in acomplishing this task you are the root. O dear therefore you should always be taken care of by us just like the wife looked after. 'The root of any objective should be protected well. This is the basis of an accomplisher. Only when the roots are intact, the trees have the ability to yield flowers and fruits. 'O warrior of proven valour O subduer of enemies in achieving this objective you are the source, being endowed with valour and wisdom. 'O best of monkeys you are the son of my guide (Vali) and respectable. We will be capable of accomplishing the goal only under your protection and guidance. Jambavan, the wise monkey having said that, Angada, the great son of Vali, replied: 'If I do not go and no other monkey leader goes, then we have to resort to fasting unto death once again. 'If I do not fulfil the objective of the wise king of monkeys I cannot save my life even after returning there (Kishkinda). 'The monkey king has the authority to shower grace or give vent to his anger. If we go without fulfilling the task we will face destruction. 'Therefore, think over well so that we do not fail ultimately. You have a vision.You should suggest means by which this mission does not misfire.' On listening to Angada's words, Jambavan, the  bull among monkeys, replied this way: 'O hero this work will not be balked. I will now inspire one who can achieve this task.'",
                "Then Jambavan observed the worries of several hundred thousands of the monkey army and said to Hanuman: 'O Hanuman you are the choicest one among many scholars wellversed in all sastras. Why do you sit alone? Why do you not speak? 'Hanuman you are equal to the king of monkeys and also Rama and Lakshmana in brilliance and strength. 'You are the son of Arishtanemi (sage Kasyapa) and Vinata, and your gurulike (elder brother) is Garuda, the greatest among birds. He is powerful and and famous. 'Garuda is very powerful, swift, and famous. I have seen him snatching serpents from the ocean many times. 'The strength of your shoulders is equal to that of his (Garuda's) wings. Your speed and valour are no less. 'O leader of the monkeys you are superior in strength, wisdom, brilliance and valour to all beings. Why do you not realise your own strength? 'O dear she was famous in the three worlds, peerless in beauty and could change form at her free will. She was born of a monkey on this land by dint of a curse. 'She was the daughter of a great king of monkeys called Kunjara. That young and beautiful lady had assumed a lustrous human form decked with wonderful garlands, ornaments and silk clothes and was roving on top of the mountain which appeared like a proud raincloud. 'She was the daughter of a great king of monkeys called Kunjara. That young and beautiful lady had assumed a lustrous human form decked with wonderful garlands, ornaments and silk clothes and was roving on top of the mountain which appeared like a proud raincloud. 'While the largeeyed lady was stationed on the mountain top, the Windgod gently let her auspicious yellow garment with red border fly away. 'Then he (Windgod) saw her curved, wellset thighs, her beautiful plump breasts and her lovely pleasing face. 'On seeing the broad hips, slender waist and beautiful limbs of that famous lady the Windgod was infatuated. 'The Windgod lost his control over himself. His whole being was overpowered by love for her beautiful, flawless body. He embraced her with his long arms. 'She was bewildered by this and being chaste and strict observer of chastiny she said, 'Who is it that has destroyed my monoandry? 'On hearing Anjana's words, the Windgod replied, ' O auspicious lady, I do you no harm, O lady of beautiful hips. I reached (enjoyed) you in mind, not body. You need not fear.' 'O renowned lady I have embraced you and united with you mentally (enjoyed you without physical contact).You will bring forth a son endowed with great wisdom and courage. 'He will be very powerful, illustrious and will be of great valour and strength. He will be my equal in leaping and flying'. 'O great monkey O strongshouldered one having been assured that way, your mother was pleased and delivered you, a bull among monkeys, in a cave. 'On seeing the rising Sun in the deep forest, mistaking him to be a fruit, you wanted to seize it, when you were young.You suddenly flew into the sky and went flying towards the Sun. 'O great monkey you went three hundred yojanas and were pushed back by the  Sun's radiance. Yet it did not leave you depressed. 'O great monkey while falling fast in space, wise Indra hurled his thunderbolt quickly at you, in anger. 'You fell on the edge of the mountain peak and your left chin  got broken. Since then you are widely known as Hanuman (one who has a wounded chin). The Windgod who is a carrier of fragrance and breaker of trees became very angry on seeing (the injury on) you and stopped blowing in the three worlds. 'O dear when the Windgod was pleased, Brahma gave a boon to you, to appease his anger. The boon made you truly valiant so that you cannot be struck by any weapon and killed. 'O lord observing that you are not hurt even when struck by the thunderbolt, Indra offered, one of the best boons to you, to choose to die only when you wish. 'You are a son of Kesari endowed with terrific strength and a lawful son of Maruta also. You are, therefore, equal to the very Windgod in flying and in brilliance. 'You are a son of Kesari endowed with terrific strength and a lawful son of Maruta also. You are, therefore, equal to the very Windgod in flying and in brilliance. 'Now we have almost lost our life.You are our saviour like another monkeyking (like Garuda, king of birds).You are fully endowed with valour and courage. 'O dear when Visnu (Vamana incarnate) took three strides I circumambulated the whole earth including its mountains and trees twentyone times. 'Then on receiving orders from the gods, we collected medicinal herbs and nectar which gave us great strength. 'I have become old and my valour is depleted. At this time you are the sole resort for us. You have all the necessary qualities. 'Cheer up and advance.You are the best among the creatures that can leap.The entire army of monkeys want to see your valour. 'O Hanuman, tiger among monkeys, rise up and cross this great ocean.You have that supreme capacity among all beings. 'O Hanuman All the monkeys look dejected. Why do you delay? O warrior, act quick with your rapid speed like Trivikrama who took three strides that covered the entire universe'.",
                "'In order to cross a hundred yojanas, Hanuman, the best of monkeys expanded his  might and strength. Seeing him, a warrior of great strength, all the monkeys, filled with enthusiasm at once gave up grief and collected together.They rejoiced and propitiated him screaming aloud. 'In order to cross a hundred yojanas, Hanuman, the best of monkeys expanded his  might and strength. Seeing him, a warrior of great strength, all the monkeys, filled with enthusiasm at once gave up grief and collected together.They rejoiced and propitiated him screaming aloud. The monkeys collected together happily, gazing at Hanuman.They were wonderstruck to see Hanuman in that huge form, just as all beings were when they saw Lord Narayana in his incarnation of Vamana. The monkeys praised the mighty Hanuman as he grew in size whirling his tail around joyfully. As Hanuman was being praised by the monkey leaders, his body filled with lustre. It looked excellent. Just as a lion grown in a mountain cave stretches its body, the Windgod's son stretched  (his limbs) at that time. On expansion, wise Hanuman's face was bright, glowing like a burning oven and  shining like smokeless fire. Hanuman risen from the midst of the monkeys with his hair bristling on the body (due to expansion of body), saluted reverentially to the elderly monkey Jambavan and said : 'The Windgod is a friend of fire who is a powerful consumer of oblations. His strength is immeasurable. He wanders in the sky and shatters the mountain tops. 'I am the lawfulson of the swiftmoving Windgod, Maruta, comparable to him in leaping. 'I can with all enthusiasm go round the vast mount Meru a thousand times without resting on it which is as though scratching the sky. 'I can submerge this world including its mountains rivers and lakes. I can push back the sea waters quickly with my arms. 'Thrust by my thighs,the ocean will rise up, carrying with it the shanks and  mighty crocodiles stunned by the force. 'I am capable of circumambulating a thousand times the great Garuda who consumes snakes and flies in the sky, the abode of birds. 'O bull among monkeys when the Sun rises from behind the eastern mountain it is possible for me to start with him and go to the western horizon and return before the blazing Sun with its beams of light sets. It is also possible for me to descend to  the earth with the same speed and return to the Sun without touching the earth. 'O bull among monkeys when the Sun rises from behind the eastern mountain it is possible for me to start with him and go to the western horizon and return before the blazing Sun with its beams of light sets. It is also possible for me to descend to  the earth with the same speed and return to the Sun without touching the earth. 'If I rise up, I can overtake all those creatures flying in the sky and from there I can stir up the ocean and tear up the earth easily. 'O monkeys when I leap, I can crush the mountains into powder and pull the vast ocean with me with the force of my thighs. And then as I leap through the sky flowers of many kinds of creepers and trees will follow me. 'O monkey when I fly upward in the dreadful sky or descend down, all creatures will see me, for my path will be the path of the constellation of Swati (a group of stars). 'O monkeys when I fly in the sky like the great mount Meru, you will see me as if I am swallowing the sky because I will be enveloping it with my strides. 'Only Garuda and Maruta have the capacity to fly like me. No one other than the king of vultures and the Windgod have the speed to fly like me. 'Only Garuda and Maruta have the capacity to fly like me. No one other than the king of vultures and the Windgod have the speed to fly like me. 'Just as the lightning generated by the clouds lands at once flying in the sky without any support I can also land in less than a moment. 'O monkeys I have a feeling in my mind that I will see Vaidehi. Be happy. 'I am equal to Maruta and Garuda in speed. I feel I can cover ten thousand yojanas (at a stretch). 'I think I can encounter Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt and obtain nectar from his hands. I can even confront Brahma, the selfborn creator courageously. I can even uproot Lanka and carry it.' The monkeys looked at him and were amazed, happy to see him roaring and shining in brilliance. Jambavan, the finest of the monkeys, felt very glad on hearing his words which put an end to the sorrow of the kith and kin and said: 'O son of Kesari O son of Maruta O hero you have removed the great grief of your race, dear 'By the blessings of the sages and by the grace of the elderly monkeys may you cross over the vast ocean. Then the tiger among monkeys, Hanuman said to those forestdwellers (monkeys), 'The earth cannot bear the thrust of my leaping. 'The rocks on the peaks of the ranges of mount Mahendra cannot with stand it, although they are huge and firm. 'I will pick up speed on the peaks of mount Mahendra filled with different kinds of trees and minerals. 'O great monkeys these mountain peaks can withstand the crushing force of my feet as I leap over a hundred yojanas. The son of Maruta, who was as eminent as the Windgod, the crusher of enemies ascended the great mountain Mahendra, full of grassland inhabited by deer, thickly grown with various trees and creepers full of fragrant flowers and fruits, where roam lions and tigers and proud elephants, a place that echoes with sounds of intoxicated birds and waterfalls.

The mighty, preeminent monkey who was equal to Indra in valour took a leap from the high peaks of the tall mountain, Mahendra Crushed by the feet of the great self, Hanuman, the huge mountain looked like a proud elephant struck by a lion. The rocks of the mountain got scattered by the force. The deer and elephants were terrified. The trees were shaken up violently and streams of water gushed forth. Shaken by the rude shock, couples of intoxicated gandharvas left in a huff the vast slopes of the great mountain. Flocks of birds and groups of vidyadharas flew away. The serpents went into hiding. Rocks fell off the shaken mountain. Shaken by the rude shock, couples of intoxicated gandharvas left in a huff the vast slopes of the great mountain. Flocks of birds and groups of vidyadharas flew away. The serpents went into hiding. Rocks fell off the shaken mountain. The serpents with their bodies half protruded out of the rocks and hissing looked like flags planted on the mountain. The alarmed and agitated sages abandonned the mountain peaks.The mountain appeared like a lone traveller separated from the caravan in the great forest. Magnanimous, wise and heroic Hanuman, destroyer of enemy warriors, fixed his attention on speed, betook himself mentally to Lanka (ere he reached it physically).       Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga in Kishkindakanda of the first epic, the Holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki."

                "Hanuman, crusher of enemies resolved to find the whereabouts of Sita, carried away by Ravana. He followed the path of the Charanas, celestial bards. Hanuman who raised his head and neck, intending to cross the formidable ocean which none else could accomplish, looked like a leading bull. Tawnyhued Hanuman, gifted with extraordinary strength and patience happily strolled on the marshy tracts of grassy land which had the colour of vaidurya. Wise Hanuman went about like a lion scaring away birds, uprooting trees with his chest, and trampling many animals. The mountain was as though decorated with mineral rocks of varied colours like blue, red, yellow and green as well as black and whiteIt was frequently visited  by yakshas, kinneras, gandharvas and nagas surrounded by their retinue, capable of assuming any form at their free will rivalling gods and nagas in splendour. The mountain was as though decorated with mineral rocks of varied colours like blue, red, yellow and green as well as black and whiteIt was frequently visited  by yakshas, kinneras, gandharvas and nagas surrounded by their retinue, capable of assuming any form at their free will rivalling gods and nagas in splendour. As the monkey leader stood at the foot of the great mountain filled with lordly elephants he looked like an elephant standing at the centre of a pond. Offering salutations with folded palms to the Sungod, to Mahendra, lord of the gods, to the windgod, to the Creator Brahma and to all the attendants of lord Siva, made up his mind to proceed (to Lanka). Hanuman, endowed with great equanimity, facing the east and joining his palms by way of salutaion to the Windgod, his father, he enlarged his size and turned south in order to depart. Having made up his mind to leap for the cause of Rama, Hanuman began to grow in size just as the sea grows during the fullmoon and newmoon days, while the monkey troops were watching. Having swollen to an immeasurable figure, he pressed on the mountain with his feet and hands in an attempt to cross the ocean. Pressed firmly by Hanuman, the mountain was shaken for a moment which caused the flowers to drop down from the tree tops. With heaps of flowers full of fragrance fallen down from the trees all over the mountain, it looked as though it was a mountain of flowers. The mountain pressed hard under the feet of the valiant (Hanuman), discharged streams of water just as an elephant in rut would exude water of intoxication. Pressed by the powerful Hanuman, mount Mahendra let out streams of the hue of gold and silver (containing the ores of these minerals) The mountain threw down big boulders along with sulphur just like fire emits columns of smoke, surrounded by flames. Squeezed on all sides of the mountain by Hanuman, all creatures living in the caves shrieked making horrible sounds . Due to the crushing of the mountain, a loud noise of the various creatures shot up filling the earth in all directions and groves around. The snakes spread out their broad hoods manifesting swastika marks on them and bit the rocks with their fangs pouring out terrible fire. Bitten by the venomous and angry snakes, the mountain was broken into a thousand pieces by the blazing flames. Even the medicinal herbs grown on the mountain could not neutralize the effect of the poison of snakes. Even the ascetics left the place approaching that the mountain would be broken into pieces by creatures. The alarmed vidyadharas leaped into the sky along with groups of their women, leaving behind golden jugs of wine as well as precious utensils, big and small sizes, and golden goblets, cups in the drinking place, as well as many tasty eatables like licking food, chewing food and many types of meat. They also left bullhides and swords with golden sheaths. Even the ascetics left the place approaching that the mountain would be broken into pieces by creatures.

They also left bullhides and swords with golden sheaths. The intoxicated vidyadharas with eyes red like lotuses, wearing garlands around the neck and smeared with red sandalpaste flew into the sky. Adorned with necklaces, anklets and armlets, the vidyadharis stayed wonderstruck in the sky, smiling gently in the company of their lovers. The seers among the Vidyadharas, proficient in different fields of knowledge were also watching the mountain from the sky along with others. Then the vidyadharas heard the words of praise(of Hanuman) by the sages, seekers of the ultimate truth, the charanas and the siddhas who stood and watched in the clear sky: \"Hanuman the son of the Windgod, who is like a mountain, with extraordinary might  intends to cross the ocean, the abode of crocodiles\". \"For the sake of Rama and the vanaras he wants to reach the other shore of the ocean, which is difficult, and indeed impossible\". The vidyadharas heard the sages speaking in that manner on the mountain. They beheld Hanuman, the bull among vanaras, whose strength  was beyond measure. Hanuman, huge as a mountain moved his body and shook the hair on his body, thundering like a cloud. Like the king of birds Garuda would shake a serpent, he shook his tail covered with hair in order to take off. Hanuman had the tail curled at his back which appeared like a big serpent being carried off by Garuda. The monkey fixed his arms, looking like iron clubs, firmly on the mountain and crouched his waist and contracted his feet. The glorious and courageous Hanuman his head and shoulders contracted, summoned up all his energy and vigour. Having cast his eyes upward in order to view the distance and direction in which he had to leap, he restrained his breath in the chest while looking at the sky. A mighty elephant among vanaras, Hanuman holding his feet firmly and standing in that position, contracted his ears and addressed the monkeys, when he was about to leap: \"Just like an arrow released by Raghava would fly, I too will proceed with the speed of the wind to reach Lanka ruled by Ravana. \"If I am not able to find the  daughter of Janaka at Lanka I will go to heaven, abode of the gods, with the same speed. \"If I do not find Sita in heaven in spite of my efforts, I will bind that king of demons, Ravana and bring him here. \"I will, by all means return successful with Sita or else I will uproot Lanka along with Ravana and bring him here\". Having thus addressed the monkeys the foremost of vanaras,Hanuman endowed with great speed leaped without any exertion. The elephant among monkeys felt like Garuda. Having thus addressed the monkeys the foremost of vanaras,Hanuman endowed with great speed leaped without any exertion. The elephant among monkeys felt like Garuda. When he took off, numerous trees on the mountain drawing together the branches all over flew along with him. He swept away the lapwings in heat on the blossoms of the trees by the speed of his thighs while he coursed through the cloudless sky. Swept away by the force of his thighs, the trees bent forward following him for a while just as relatives accompany their kith and kin on long travel. Uprooted by the force of Hanuman's thighs,great trees like  sala followed him just like the troops follow the king. With numerous trees laden with flowers following him, Hanuman who looked like a mountain, presented a queer spectable. Then the huge trees sank into the ocean of salt water even as mountains did, afraid of Indra's (thunderbolt). Covered with tender sprouts and buds of different kinds of flowers Hanuman shone brightly like a flying mountain with fireflies. Shedding their blossoms (under his thrust) the trees dropped into the waters of the sea just like close relatives follow at the time of farewell. Driven by the wind caused by Hanuman's speed a variety of flowers fell into the ocean because of their light weight and the ocean looked colourful and bright like the starspangled sky. Covered with blossoms of different kinds and colours, Hanuman looked like a cloud brightened by lightnings in the sky. The seawater looked splendid with flowers dropped by dint of his speed. It  resembled the firmament spangled with enchanting stars just risen in the sky. That great Vanara appeared as if he was gulping the entire ocean with its rising waves. While he was looking upward it appeared as though he was keen to drink in the sea as well. While he was looking upward, that great vanara appeared as if, parched with thirst, he was gulping the entire ocean with its rising waves. As he was moving in the sky following the direction of the wind, his eyes blazed like two fires burning on the mountain, flashing like lightning. The large, round, reddishbrown eyes of Hanuman shed their bright light like the rising Moon and Sun. By the reflection of his copperyred nose, his face looked red like the Sun's orb coming close at twilight. As the son of the Windgod was flying through the sky, his coiled up tail looked splendid like the banner installed at the festival in honour of Indra (on the fifteenth day of the month of Bhadrapada). With his white teeth and curled up tail, the wise son of the Windgod looked splendid like the halo of the Sungod. The great monkey with copperred buttocks (other parts being dark) looked splendid like a cleft mountain with a huge deposit of minerals shining red. The wind passing through the arm pits of the lionlike vanara crossing the ocean sounded like a thundering cloud. The elephantlike monkey was seen darting across the ocean(going from north to south) like a meteor risen in the north  along with its tailend falling down the sky. The vanara expanded into an enormous size form appeared as though moving like the setting Sun. He looked like a huge elephant bound round the waist. When the vanara was flying in the sky, his shadow reflected in the ocean looked like a ship driven by the wind and sailing on the sea below (as if the lower part of his body was under water and upper part occupied the sky) Whichever part of the sea over which that monkey flew, it appeared as though it was riotous with eddies, whirlpools and revolving foam etc., stirred up by the speed of his thighs. As the great vanara was flying swiftly, the oceanic waves in rows dashing against his chest rose as high as the  mountain. The forceful wind generated by the monkey moving swiftly, and by the clouds agitated the ocean violently, creating dreadful sounds. As the tiger among the monkeys pushed the big network of waves of the saltwater ocean and leaped forward, it appeared as if  he was drawing the intermediary space dividing the earth and the sky. Hanuman moving along in high speed looked as if he was counting the mighty waves risen ike Meru and Mandara mountains. Then the water raised by his onrush along with the cloud widely spread in the sky shone like an outstreched autumnal cloud. On account of the seawater rising up,  the whales, crocodiles, fish and tortoises laid bare like the limbs of the body disrobed. Seeing Hanuman, the tiger among vanaras, coursing through the sky the serpents in their seaabode mistook him for Garuda. The shadow of Hanuman, the lion among monkeys, thirty yojanas long and ten yojanas in breadth appeared more pleasing The broad shadow of the son of the Windgod in the sea following him shone like a dark row of clouds sailing in the pristine sky. Hanuman the great vanara, splendid with a huge body coursing through the air seemed like a winged mountain flying the sky without any support. As the powerful monkey, an elephant among vanaras, was proceeding swiftly along, the ocean got instantly transformed into a trough on account of water swelling by the force of his flight. Hanuman was found pulling clusters of big clouds along with him like the Windgod and appeared like Garuda,the king of birds, drawing flocks of birds along with him at the time of landing. While Hanuman was drawing big clouds which were either white or red or blue or yellow, he looked charming. Entering into and emerging from the clouds, he looked like the Moon that appears and disappears (behind a bank of clouds). Then seeing Hanuman crossing quickly, the gods, gandharvas and demons rained flowers on him. The Sun spared Hanuman from the heat and even the Windgod served him, blowing cool while he was taking leaps in order to fulfil Rama's mission. The sages praised him while he was coursing through the sky, the gods and gandharvas sang in praise of him extolling his majesty and vigour. Observing the unwearied monkey the nagas, yakshas, the demons (protecting the southwest), the learned sages and birds praised him. While the monkeychief was leaping (across the sea) the Seagod wished the wellbeing of the Ikshvaku family and honoured him. (The Seagod belonged to the same race) : 'If I fail to help the monkeychief, the wise will blame me'. 'I expanded on account of a scion of the Ikshvaku race (Sagara) and I should not do anything to make him (Hanuman) suffer since he is the minister helping the Ikshvaku race'. 'I will have to make arrangements for his rest. Later he can resume his journey comfortably'. Having resolved in his mind, the Seagod addressed the noble, golden mount Mainaka, hidden in the sea: 'O foremost mountain you are kept here by Indra, lord of the gods as a barrier against the intrusion of demons residing in the netherworld. \"You are staying at the entrance preventing the violent demons of the immeasurable nether world from jumping onto the surface. \"O noble mountain you have the capacity to grow across, upward and downward by your free will. I therefore prompt you to grow. \"Valiant Hanuman, a tiger among monkeys and a performer of dreadful deeds, is  flying over you to fulfil Rama's mission \"I should help him for he is working for the welfare of the Ikshavaku family. The Ikshvaku kings are worthy of adoration to me and for you as well. \"You may act as our minister and let us not miss this chance. Pious men lose their cool if a worthy act is left unfulfilled. \"Rise up from the waters. Let him rest on you since this noble monkey is our guest and worthy of worship. \"O goldenpeaked mountainyou are the refuge of the gods and gandharvas. Let him also rest on you for a while before he negotiates the remaining part of the journey. \"You ought to rise up if you consider the nobility of the scion of the Kakusthas, the deportation of Mythili, and the exertion put forth by Hanuman, the lord of monkeys\". Hearing the command of the god of the ocean, mount Mainaka, rich in gold and covered with trees and creepers rose up at once from the water. Just as the rising Sun comes out with glowing rays tearing the veil of dark clouds, the mountain rose up from the water of the ocean. At the instance of Varuna, (the presiding deity of the ocean) the lofty mountain appeared, projecting its peaks, hitherto submerged in the water. The golden peaks inhabited by nagas and kinnaras resemmbled the rising Sun as though scraping the sky in a moment. At the instance of Varuna, (the presiding deity of the ocean) the lofty mountain appeared, projecting its peaks, hitherto submerged in the water. The golden peaks inhabited by nagas and kinnaras resemmbled the rising Sun as though scraping the sky in a moment. The sky shone like barnished weapons smeared with the golden colour of the mountain peaks that rose up above the water. The noble mountain, Mainaka was glittering  like a thousand Suns with selfeffulgent golden peaks shining. Hanuman considered the mountain rising up in the midst of the ocean and standing in front an impediment. The great vanara,who was swift in action felled down the mountain that had risen high instantly with his chest just as the wind would strike a cloud. Felled by the vanara's speed, the tall mountain overwhelmed with joy roared in high pitch. Now the mountain assumed a human form  and standing on its own summit, which stood very high, and glad at heart, addressed the heroic vanara gone to the aerial region. Now the mountain assumed a human form  and standing on its own summit, which stood very high, and glad at heart, addressed the heroic vanara gone to the aerial region. \"O best of vanaras you have achieved a formidable deed. Alighting on my peak and comfortably resting awhile, you may resume your journey. \"The son of Rama's family, Sagara, has extended the ocean in the past.It is most appropriate that he (the god of the sea) honours you in return as you have set out in the service of Rama. \"I was prompted by the ocean for your sake since he has great regard for you. O great monkey you may rest here for a while and continue your journey. The lord of the ocean feels that this tiger among monkeys can cover the distance of a hundred yojanas. He tells me, 'let him rest on your peak and then cover the rest of the distance'. \"I was prompted by the ocean for your sake since he has great regard for you. O great monkey you may rest here for a while and continue your journey. The lord of the ocean feels that this tiger among monkeys can cover the distance of a hundred yojanas. He tells me, 'let him rest on your peak and then cover the rest of the distance'. \"O foremost of the monkeys after eating plenty of sweet and tasty roots and fruits and resting a while you may go. \"O chief of monkeys, indeed we too have a relationship with you based on merit  which is wellknown to all the three worlds. \"O son of the Windgod you are an elephant among monkeys, the foremost among them who move at a high speed. \"Even a newcomer, however ordinary, deserves worship by a wise man who wishes to educate himself in the path of righteousness. Needless to say that distinguished guest like you deserves all reverence. \"O foremost among the vanaras you are the son of the highsouled Windgod's, preeminent among the gods, you are also equal to him in speed. \"O knower of righteousness to worship you is to honour the Windgod. Therefore you are worthy of worship for me. I will tell you the reason. Listen. \"Formerly in Kritayuga, O dear, mountains were endowed with wings. They used to move speedily in all directions like Garuda and the Windgod. \"When they moved about, even hosts of sages, gods and creatures panicked for fear of falling down (and destroying all worlds). \"Provoked at this, the thousandeyed Indra who had performed a hundred sacrifices cut off the wings of mountains into a thousands pieces with his thunderbolt. \"Angry Indra held the thunderbolt and came towards me chasing. At that time the great Wind-god tossed me into the air and dropped me down at once. \"O distinguished vanara your father, the Windgod threw me down into this saltwater sea. Thus my wings were protected. \"O esteemed vanara the Windgod is revered by me and so I honour you. O chief of monkeys, my bondage with you is therefore of high value to me, indeed. \"O great monkey when I hold you so high, you ought to oblige me and the (god of the) ocean wholeheartedly (and accept our hospitalty). \"O noble monkey oblige us by accepting our offering given with love and be relieved of your fatigue. Your presence itself is welcome to me\". The great Hanuman, pleased with the words of Mainaka, said \"I am pleased at your hospitality. Remove your unhappiness. \"My commitment is hastening me. The day set (for the accomplishment of the task) is also drawing to a close. A vow is made and I will not halt in the middle of my work.\" Having said this, the mighty monkey gently touched the mountain with his hands before ascending to the sky with a smile on his face. The mountain and the sea honoured and adored the son of the Windgod and gave him appropriate  blessings. And thereafter leaping a long distance into the clear sky, he (Hanuman) took the path of the Windgod, his father, leaving behind the mountain and the sea. Rising higher and further up and looking at the mountain (which was going down into the ocean), the son of the Windgod coursed through the cloudless sky unsupported. Gods, siddhas as well as the great sages praised him for the second great achievment of Hanuman, which is impossible for others to accomplish. The gods who happened to be present at that time (on the mountain) and the thousandeyed Indra were delighted by the gesture of golden Sunabha (Mainaka) mountain. Indra, the lord of Sachi, was personally satisfied and spoke to Mainaka, the best of mountains, in faltering tone, his throat choked out of joy. \"O Hiranyanabha, the foremost among the mountains I am highly pleased with you. I give you security (free from fear of losing wings). O pious one you may stay on happily as you please. \"You have rendered very valuable help to Hanuman who was attempting to leap  a distance of a hundred yojanas. He is fearless even when there is reason to fear (of falling down). \"The vanara has gone on a mission to help the son of Dasaratha. I am highly pleased with the service rendered to him. Thereafter Mainaka, the great mountain was delighted to see Indra,  lord of the gods, performer of a hundred yajnas satisfied. Then mount Mainaka, assured by Indra became secure. And Hanuman also crossed over the ocean in a short while. Then the gods, gandharvas, siddhas and great sages approached Surasa, the mother of nagas, who was glowing like the Sungod and said:. \"The glorious son of the Windgod, called Hanuman, is crossing the ocean. Obstruct him for sometime by assuming the hideous form of a demon, gigantic as a mountain, fearful with yellowishbrown eyes, with big teeth and a wide mouth like the sky. \"The glorious son of the Windgod, called Hanuman, is crossing the ocean. Obstruct him for sometime by assuming the hideous form of a demon, gigantic as a mountain, fearful with yellowishbrown eyes, with big teeth and a wide mouth like the sky. \"We want to assess his strength, valour and intelligence once again. We wish to know whether he will win or give way to despondency\". Thus honoured by the gods, Surasa assumed a terrific ugly form frightening to all and stood in the midst of the ocean. Putting up a distorted appearance and encompassing Hanuman who was crossing the ocean, she spoke to him: Thus honoured by the gods, Surasa assumed a terrific ugly form frightening to all and stood in the midst of the ocean. Putting up a distorted appearance and encompassing Hanuman who was crossing the ocean, she spoke to him: \"O bull among vanaras the lords of the universe have provided you as food for me. I will eat you. Enter my mouth\". Thus addressed by Surasa,  the glorious Hanuman said this with a blooming face and folded hands: \"Dasaratha's son called Rama accompanied by his brother Lakshmana and his wife Vaidehi entered Dandaka forest. \"While Rama was engaged otherwise, his glorious wife Sita was abducted by Ravana actuated by deeprooted enmity of demons with him. \"I am going as Rama's emissary to search for his wife. It is proper for you to render help since you are a resident of his kingdom. Having heard Hanuman, Surasa capable of taking any form at her free will told him that no one can cross (her region) as she had been given such a boon(by the Creator) Surasa, mother of serpents, observing that Hanuman was attempting to escape, said this in order to gauge his strength: \"O best vanara you must pass through my mouth today. Such is the boon granted to me by Brahma in the past\". Then she quickly opened her big mouth and stood. Thus addressed by Surasa, Hanuman the supreme vanara said, \"Open your mouth wide enough to hold me.\" Provoked by the words of Surasa, Hanuman stretched himself to ten yojanas. Seeing his body stretched to ten yojanas like a cloud, Surasa also widened her mouth to twenty yojanas. Provoked, Hanuman further stretched his body to thirty yojanas and Surasa on her own enlarged her mouth to forty yojanas. Then the great hero Hanuman stretched his body to fifty yojanas. Provoked, Hanuman further stretched his body to thirty yojanas and Surasa on her own enlarged her mouth to forty yojanas. Then the great hero Hanuman stretched his body to fifty yojanas. Surasa widened her mouth sixty yojanas and then the heroic Hanuman enlarged himself to seventy yojanas. Surasa widened her mouth to eighy yojanas and the heroic Hanuman grew up to ninety yojanas, looking like a mountain. Intelligent Hanuman observing Surasa's enlarged mouth open and dreadful like hell with a long tongue, suddenly shrunk his body to the size of a thumb. Glorious and mighty  Hanuman quickly went into her mouth and got out and stood in the sky and said:. \"O Dakshayani I have indeed entered your mouth and your boon has come true (as nobody can go against the boon of the Creator). Allow me to proceed in quest of Vaidhehi. My salutations to you.\" Seeing Hanuman released out of her mouth like the Moon released from the mouth of Rahu, Surasa assumed her true form and said: \"O noble vanara proceed happily to achieve your purpose. Go and unite Vaidehi with the noble self, Raghava. Witnessing Hanuman achieving a very difficult feat for the third time, all the living beings applauded him saying \"Well done, welldone\". Rising above the invincible ocean, the abode of lord Varuna, Hanuman coursed through the sky speedily like Garuda. Hanuman passed through the path of wind like Garuda. The region was refreshed with clouds that released torrents of rain and frequented by birds. The great masters of music (Tumburu, Narada and Gandharvas) trained in Kasika moved there driven by lions, elephants, tigers, birds and serpents and were moving in different aerial vehicles. It was splendid with god at fire who strikes fiercely like thunderbolt. It was inhabited by great sages who had acquired merit. The region was traversed by firegod who carried havis in large quantities earnestly. It was decorated with planets, constellations, Moon, Sun and clusters of stars. It was filled with groups of greal sages, gandharvas, nagas and yakshas. It was isolated part of the universe traversed by the king of gandharvas like Vishvavasu. It was an auspicious path for Moon and Sun, a sporting ground for Airavata, the vehicle of lord Indra. It was an extensive world of living beings created by Brahma.

He appeared like a longwinged king of mountains unsupported. Seeing Hanuman speeding in the sky a demoness called Simhika who can assume any form at her will had grown out of proportion and thought on her part: Thinking thus, she dragged him by his shadow before she took hold of him, Hanuman started deliberating within. \"I am caught suddenly. I am handicapped.I am like a huge ship in an ocean retarded by the wind blowing from the opposite direction. Looking around, right and left, up and down, the monkey saw a huge being rise from the salty sea. Seeing the form with a hideous countenance, Hanuman reflected about the creature of ugly appearance endowed with power which can catch a creature though his shadow, about which king Sugriva had once told him. 'It is the same creature, no doubt', said Hanuman. Recognising the true nature of Simhika the clutcher of shadows, the wise Hanuman grew to a huge size like a cloud in rainy season. Observing the body of Hanuman growing in size, Simhika started distending her mouth wide like the depth of the underworld. Roaring like a heavy mass of clouds, Simhika chased Hanuman. Intelligent Hanuman observed her enormous mouth and noticed her vital parts. Roaring like a heavy mass of clouds, Simhika chased Hanuman. Intelligent Hanuman observed her enormous mouth and noticed her vital parts. Hanuman, the vanara whose physique was as hard as thunderbolt suddenly contracted once again and entered her opened mouth. The siddhas and charanas who were watching his performance of drowning in her mouth were amazed as though the moon is seized by Rahu on a fullmoon night. The vanara who had the speed of mind tore her vital parts with his sharp nails and rushed out quickly before she closed her mouth. Selfcontrolled Hanuman, the great monkey acting with firmness of mind and ingenuity threw her down and once again rapidly grew in size. Heart torn asunder and killed by Hanuman, miserable Simhika instantly fell into the sea water. Observing it, the beings who ranged the sky said to the foremost of vanaras: \"O great jumper a great deed has been done by you today in killing that fierce creature. O great monkey fulfil your mission without any obstruction. \"O lord of vanaras he in whom these four qualities, fortitude, vision, intelligence and dexterity exist as in you will achieve his mission and not get lost\". Honoured by them the venerable monkey went ascending into the sky like Garuda to achieve the objective. On reaching the other side of the shore crossing  a hundred yojanas, he saw rows of forest trees. Hanuman, the best among jumpers, even while in air he saw an island adorned with many trees, also gardens adjacent to Malaya mountain.",
                "The mighty Hanuman crossed the inviolable sea, stood comfortably on the peak of Trikuta mountain and looked at Lanka. Covered fully with the continuous shower of flowers dropped on him from the trees, heroic Hanuman appeared as though he was a heap of flowers as he stood there. The glorious, powerful vanara (Hanuman) even after crossing a hundred yojanas, felt neither suffocated nor exasperated. (He said to himself), \"I can cross a distance of even hundreds of yojanas. What to say of a hundred yojanas which is a calculated distance.\" Courageous and exalted Hanuman, the best among vanaras, noted for his speed reached Lanka crossing over the great ocean on his own. Hanuman passed through forests laden with fragrant flowers, bluish grassy land, big rocks and mountains covered with trees. Brilliant Hanuman, a bull among monkeys, crossed the mountains covered with blossoming trees and forest ranges. That son of the Windgod stood on the mountain and saw the forests and groves round Lanka situated on the mountain peak. The mighty vanara saw around Lanka, trees like sarala, karnikara in full bloom, datepalms, priyala, muchulinda, kutaja, kethaka trees filled with fragrance priyangu, kadamba, so also flowering plants like saptachhada, asana, kovidara and karaveera fully loaded with flowers and buds. These trees were thronged by birds, with their branches shaken by the wind. Flocks of swans and waterfowls were found in ponds of different types. There were various pleasure groves with flowers in bloom and fruits of all seasons and varieties of water resorts and delightful gardens.

Fortunate Hanuman having reached Lanka ruled by Ravana found it surrounded by moats full of blue lotuses, guarded by demons with frightening bows, in view of Sita abducted and kept there. It was protected by boundary walls inlaid with gold that great and beautiful city with buildings resembling the assembly of planets and whitewashed, elevated  houses looking like autumnal clouds and well laid out streets decorated with garlands of banners and flag posts, rows of colourful creepers and festoons. The city of Lanka appeared like Amaravati, the city of gods.

The city of Lanka appeared like Amaravati, the city of gods. The foremost among the vanaras, perched on top of the mountain saw the city of Lanka on the mountain with auspicious mansions as though touching the sky. The city of Lanka, ruled by the lord of demons and built by Visvakarma looked as if it was a city floating in the sky. Having reached the northern entrance of the city he started thinking that Visvakarma must have conceived Lanka as a lady with its ramparts as her hips and loins, moats filled with water as her robes, the spiked iron tridents as her locks of hair, and the tall towers as her her ear rings Having reached the northern entrance of the city he started thinking that Visvakarma must have conceived Lanka as a lady with its ramparts as her hips and loins, moats filled with water as her robes, the spiked iron tridents as her locks of hair, and the tall towers as her her ear rings Observing Lanka that resembled mount Kailas, with sky scrapers appearing as if flying, filled with dreadful demons and nagas protecting the city of Bhogavati (the city of Patala), unimaginably wellbuilt. It was once occupied by Kubera (half brother of Ravana). It was guarded by horrible demons holding tridents and spears in their hands. The city appeared like a cavern protected by venomous serpents with protruding fangs. Hanuman examined the high security of Lanka and looked at the ocean. He thought of the form of Ravana, a formidable  enemy: Observing Lanka that resembled mount Kailas, with sky scrapers appearing as if flying, filled with dreadful demons and nagas protecting the city of Bhogavati (the city of Patala), unimaginably wellbuilt.

The city appeared like a cavern protected by venomous serpents with protruding fangs. Hanuman examined the high security of Lanka and looked at the ocean. He thought of the form of Ravana, a formidable  enemy: 'It is not possible for monkeys to come here and even if they do, it is no use. Lanka is invincible even to the gods in war. 'What will  Rama the mighty armed hero do even after reaching this formidable city of Lanka ruled by Ravana? 'There is no scope for reconciliation with the demons. It is not possible to win over them with gifts. They cannot be divided by dissension. There is no scope for war. 'Only four great monkeys can have access to this place. They are Angada the son of Vali, Nila, Sugriva, the wise king of monkeys and myself. 'Whether Janaka's daughter, Vaidehi is alive or not is not known. After seeing her I shall think over'. Standing on the mountain, the elephant among monkeys pondered for a while on the means of finding Sita, in which lay the welfare of Rama. 'I shall not be able  in my present form to enter the city guarded by fierce and powerful demons. 'To accomplish this great task I will have to assume an inconspicious form and enter the city of Lanka in the night as that is the appropriate time. 'Looking at the city, unassailable even to gods and demons, Hanuman sighed again and again thinking: 'By what means can I find Mythili, daughter of Janaka, without being noticed by the evilminded Ravana, the lord of demons? 'How can the purpose of Rama, a noble soul be not spoilt? I may have a private audience with the daughter of Janaka. 'Just as darkness disappears at Sunrise, wellplanned strategies also fail at the hands of a thoughtless messenger when they are set in opposition to proper time and place. 'Even though messengers are not intelligent, they think themselves clever and capable. They act foolishly, swerve from proper course of action and fail in their effort. 'How should the task be performed? How to avoid impetuousness? How can my purpose of crossing the ocean be not wasted? 'If I am seen by the demons, the plan of Rama, possessor of selfknowledge, to kill Ravana, will be wasted. 'It is difficult to stay with the demon anywhere here even in the disguise of a demon without being identified. It will not be possible to remain unidentified even by assuming any other form. 'I think even the wind who has no form cannot move here without being detected. Nothing escapes the notice of powerful demons. There is nothing unknown to them. 'I will surely meet with death if I hide here in my original form and my master's mission also will be spoilt. 'Therefore I shall transform myself into a tiny form and jump about the city of Lanka during night time in order to accomplish Raghava's purpose. 'Entering by night the inaccessible city of Ravana, I shall search all over the palace and find Sita'. Having planned in that manner the heroic Hanuman keen to see Sita waited for the Sunset. When Sun set, Maruti, the son of the Windgod, reduced himself at night to the small size of a cat, wonderful to behold. As soon as dusk had set in, courageous Hanuman jumped in and entered the well laidout royal path of the beautiful city. Hanuman saw the city stretched with rows of buildings all over,with seven or eight storied  mansions, which had pillars of gold and silver, windows with fretwork of gold, inlaid with crystals, floors decorated with gold, resembling the grand city of gandharvas. Hanuman saw the city stretched with rows of buildings all over,with seven or eight storied  mansions, which had pillars of gold and silver, windows with fretwork of gold, inlaid with crystals, floors decorated with gold, resembling the grand city of gandharvas. Inlaid with precious gems and fretwork, and ornamented with pearls, the mansions of demons looked splendid. The golden archways of the demon were colourful. They illuminated the well   decorated Lanka from all sides. Beholding Lanka of unimaginable, wonderful glory, the great monkey keen to see Sita became sad as well as elated at once (He did not know how to find Sita in that city and felt sad. But he was also elated that he was going to meet her at any cost.) He found that famed place with a garland of tall, white mansions, conspicuous with archways latticed with gold strings, protected by mighty Ravana and surrounded by terrific demons. Even the Moon rose with thousands of rays in the centre of multitudes of stars overspreading and illumining the world with a canopy of bright beams, as if to render ministerial help to Hanuman. The heroic vanara saw the rising Moon flitting in and out shining like a fresh white conch, in the colour of milk and lotus stalks, bright like a swan floating in the lakelike sky.       Thus ends the second sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The mighty son of the Windgod, intelligent Hanuman, an elephant among vanaras, standing on the peak of the Lamba which looked like a high rainbearing cloud and relying on his energy, entered by night the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana  rich in delightful forests, groves and water pools.

The staircases built with silver were studded with vaidurya. The beautiful quadrangles, coverd with grains of crystal were as though leaping into the air.

Gazing at the enchanting, auspicious, prosperous city of the king of demons mighty Hanuman began to reflect: 'It is not possible to attack this city by to outsiders as it is protected by the forces of Ravana with their weapons ready(to attack). 'This land can be reached by Kumuda and Angada or the great vanara Sushena and even by Mainda and Dvivida. 'Son of Vivaswan (Sugriva), the chief of vanaras, Kushaparva, Riksha (Jambavan), Ketumala and myself also will be able to reach this place. Reflecting upon the valour of longarmed Rama and valiant advances of Lakshmana Hamuman felt pleased (within himself). Hanuman looked at the city of the demon king, whose darkness was dispelled by bright gems and mighty mansions as if it were a young maiden. The prosperous city was like a well decorated woman, adorned with ornaments having walls for her dress, the stables for her earrings, the armouries for her breasts. Hanuman looked at the city of the demon king, whose darkness was dispelled by bright gems and mighty mansions as if it were a young maiden. The prosperous city was like a well decorated woman, adorned with ornaments having walls for her dress, the stables for her earrings, the armouries for her breasts. Assuming her real form the presiding deity of Lanka noticed the son of the Windgod, the tiger among vanaras of great prowess entering the city. Seeing the best of vanaras, the deity of the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana rose up before him in a distorted form. She stood in front of the son of the Windgod and spoke to him in a loud voice. \"O dweller of the forest, who are you? Why did you come here? Speak the truth about your identity, so long as you hold on to your life. \"O vanara this Lanka is a secret place protected by Ravana's army everywhere. It is surely not possible for you to enter this city\". Then Hanuman who was standing in front of her said, \"I will tell you the truth since you are asking me\". \"Who are you, terrible woman of ugly, distorted eyes? Why are you obstructing me at the gate of the city? Why do you impound upon me? The spirit of Lanka who could assume any form at her will got enraged on hearing the words of Hanuman and spake in a harsh tone. \"In obedience to the orders of the great demon king, Ravana, I am protecting this unassailable city. \"It is not possible for you to enter this city ignoring my presence. Soon you will be killed. You will give up your life and attain eternal sleep. \"O monkey I am the presiding ogress of Lanka presenting myself personally. I  am to protect this city. This is my answer to you\". On hearing the words of ogress of Lanka, the son of the Windgod stood up ready and appeared like another mountain. Seeing the monster of a woman, the powerful Hanuman, bull among vanaras endowed with wisdom spoke to her. \"I would like to see this Lanka with marketplaces, gateways and ramparts. I have come here for that purpose. My curiosity has been roused to see this place. \"I have arrived here to see Lanka's gardens, groves and forests and also all the important houses\". On hearing Hanuman, the ogress of Lanka, who could assume any form, replied in harsh words: \"O evilminded, foolish monkey It is not possible for you to enter the city ruled by Ravana, the king of demons without conquering me\". The tiger among monkeys said to the, the nightwalker \"O noble Lanka I shall see this city and go back\". Then the ogress of Lanka made a loud and frightening sound and struck the most powerful vanara  with the palm of her hand. At this strong slap, the heroic Hanuman, son of the Windgod roared loudly. Overcome by anger, Hanuman clenched the fingers of his left hand and hit her with his fist. Considering her to be, after all, a woman he did not turn outrageous. Struck by the blow of Hanuman the demoness fell down on the ground at once, her limbs shattered, her face distorted. Wise and brilliant Hanuman, seeing the deity fallen down, left her (without killing her) out of compassion, thinking that she is a woman, after all. Thereafter, the deflated demoness of Lanka with an agitated voice, said to Hanuman, the monkeyhero: \"O, strongshouldered great monkey be gracious. Save me. Heroes endowed with great strength stay back when the time comes. \"O monkey I am Lanka incarnate. You have conquered me by your strength and valour. \"O lord of vanaras in the past Creator Brahma had given me a boon which has come true. I will tell you. listen. 'When a vanara vanquishes you by his prowess, you may know that destruction of ogres will set in. \"O gentle one the time ordained by Brahma has come today with your presence  here. The truth revealed by Brahma, the selfborn, cannot be proved otherwise. \"The ruin of all demons and evilminded king Ravana will take place due to (the abduction of) Sita. \"O great vanara enter the city ruled by Ravana and accomplish your purpose. \"O lord of vanaras you may search for the chaste lady, daughter of king Janaka all over freely entering this doomed city, ruled by the chief of demons.       Thus ends the third sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman, the strongshouldered, mighty monkey chief having defeated the (presiding) deity of Lanka who could assume any form at her will, leaped over the boundary wall of the rear entrance of the excellent city by his prowess. Hanuman, a devotee of the king of monkeys entered the city of Lanka placing his left foot first on the forehead of the city and proceeded (by tradition one enters the enemy's dwelling by placing the left foot first to cause defeat of the enemy). The son of the Windgod, endowed with great strength, entered the enchanting Lanka and walked along the highway set with flowers of pearls. The son of the Windgod, endowed with great strength, entered the enchanting Lanka and walked along the highway set with flowers of pearls. The houses reverberating with sounds of laughter and of musical instruments, decorated with lattice windows of diamonds resembled the sky shining with clouds with a goad made of diamond (thunderbolt of Indra). The city of Lanka appeared radiant with its tall mansions resembling white clouds. The  mansions had auspicious marks of lotus and swastika engraved on them and were opening in the direction of the south. The city of Lanka appeared radiant with its tall mansions resembling white clouds. The  mansions had auspicious marks of lotus and swastika engraved on them and were opening in the direction of the south. Glorious Hanuman, wellwisher of Sugriva, king of vanaras, looked around the city, decorated with colourful garlands. Surveying it for the cause of Raghava, he was greatly delighted. Going from one building to another, Hanuman saw mansions of different kinds  structures. He heard melodious songs of intoxicated women set to tune in three places namely chest, throat and head and three pitches known as mandra (slow) madhya (medium) and tara (high). The songs resembled those of the apsarasas well set in musical notes set to music. Great Hanuman heard the jingling sounds of waist bells and anklets of women and sounds of great men climbing up and down flights of steps, sounds of clapping and joking everywhere in the mansions. He heard chantings of sacred verses in the houses of demons engaged in the study of the vedas. And heard demons singing loudly the eulogy of Ravana.

He observed large contingents of demons lining the highway and spies of Ravana stationed in the middle of the city. Going around Lanka, Hanuman witnessed all kinds of demons priests who were performing rituals, ascetics with matted hair, some with shaven heads, and some robed in cowhides. Some were  holding fistfuls of darbha grass (as weapons), others held sacrificial tools (as weapons), some had mallets, some hammers and others had staff and spikes. Some looked frightful with a single eye, some with a single ear, some with drooping stomachs and sagging breasts and in distorted forms. Similarly some dwarfs and some wielding iron weapons, their bodies covered with wonderful shields some not very tall or short, not stout or thin, not very dark and not with hideous forms or mutilated bodies. Some had goodlooking countenances, some were seen holding posts and flags and weapons of several kinds.

It was resonating with pleasing sounds of jingling ornaments made more noisy by the neighing of the horses. There were carriages, chariots, flying chariots, horses and elephants.

                "Then intelligent Hanuman observed the Moon in the central part of the sky spreading a canopy of his luminescence like the Sun, and looking like an intoxicated mighty (white) bull moving in a stable. While moving forward, Hanuman saw the Moon spreading his light, thereby warding off the agony of all creatures, causing the swelling of the ocean and illuminating the earth as well as the sky. 'The  same splendour on the Mandara mountain on earth, which glows at dusk lay on the ocean is there, on lotuses in the lakes and on the beautiful Moon also. 'Like a swan in a cage of silver, like a lion in a cave of Mandara mountain, like a hero on a proud, intoxicated elephant, the Moon shone in the sky. The fullmoon with its hornlike spot  shone like a bull with sharp horns, like the  white Himalayan mountain with its lofty peaks, and like an elephant with gold plated tusks With the Sun, the great planet (star), destroying the frost that forms the dew, the Moon with its stain shone with graceful radiance. The Moon shone bright like a lion mounted on a rock, like a lordly elephant in a deep forest, like a king on attaining the kingdom. At  the time of moonrise, the darkness of dusk is dispelled, the dark deeds of cannibals disappear, the natural instinct for love returns to women as the radiance of the Moon spreads everywhere like in heaven. Pleasing sounds of string instruments had begun to be heard. Chaste women were found asleep with their husbands.The nightrangers had begun their strange (evil and cruel) deeds exhibiting their anger. Intelligent Hanuman, the great warrior, observed there in the prosperous mansions, demons proud of their wealth, highly intoxicated and dull, their houses full of horsedrawn chariots with comfortable seats. The intoxicated demons were quarrelling, ridiculing one another bitterly and wildly throwing their stout arms on one another, indulging in incoherent talk, uttering vulgar words. The demons were seen expanding their chests sportively and caressing their wives by placing their limbs on them. They were assuming wonderful forms, and drawing their bows up to their ears. He even saw women collected there, their limbs smeared with unguents on their bodies, like wise women with beautiful countenances laughing at others, some sleeping, and others hissing (sighing) like angry serpents. There were huge elephants trumpeting, respected people, warriors sighing for the lack of enemies (to vanquish). It had a lake infested with hissing snakes. He saw there in the city of Lanka, demons, who were intellectuals, pleasing in words, with faith in religion, preeminent heroes of the world  of different kinds, followers of good practices and with lovely names. He rejoiced to see the handsome demons radiant with forms commensurate with their virtues. He also saw some ugly figures, their traits in conformity to their forms. There he saw demonesses adorned with choicest ornaments, their minds attached faithfully to their husbands and bottles of wine. Some of the wives of the demons, however, looked gentle and bright like stars. There he saw cheerful demonesses shining brightly, abashed by the embrace of their beloveds during the night. He also saw those sporting with their beloveds freely and looking like birds embracing flowers. Intelligent Hanuman saw demonesses seated happily on the laps of their beloved ones on the terraces of the mansions, exhibiting their attachment to one another,  overwhelmed with sexual pleasure. Ogresses without veil, some altruistic, some separated from their husbands looked pale like the Moon, though possessed of  polished gold complexion. That heroic monkey saw ogresses delighted in the happy company of their loved ones who have joined them, ecstatic wives in the houses. He saw rows of faces of shedemons shining like moonlight with sidelong glances and graceful eyelashes wearing ornaments resembling charmimg flashes of lightning. Hanuman could not find Sita  anywhere, an excellent lady  born in a noble royal family, adopting the right path, a lady  delicate like a blossoming creeper of good breed, or so he imagined. 'Sita must have had a pair of beautiful eyes. She must have been a passionate lady with mind fixed on her glorious husband. Ever established in dharma, she is perhaps a distinguished lady compared to her counterparts (in Lanka). She whose neck  was adorned with costly ornaments earlier must be shedding hot tears now, her throat choked with grief. With her beautiful eyelashes and a sweet loving voice, she would be now like a  peahen wandering in the woods. She would be like a barely visible ray of the Moon, like a streak of gold covered with dust, like an unhealed scar of a wound caused by an arrow only superficially covered and like a flake of cloud swept off by the wind. Hanuman stood griefstricken, having (unsuccessfully) searched for a long time for the wife of Rama, the lord of men. The highly eloquent was now despondent. For a while he looked dull and dejected.       Thus ends the fifth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The mighty Hanuman, who could assume any form at will, not finding Sita in the tall mansions, again started rapidly ranging in Lanka. Then he reached the residence of the lord of demons enclosed by a red colour compound wall dazzling like the midday Sun. The elephant among vanaras (Hanuman), scanned the mansion defended by dreadful demons like a forest protected by lions. He saw beautiful silver archways decorated with gold, colourful inner apartments with beauteous entrances. (He saw) archways guarded by riders mounted on majestic elephants and unwearied riders of chariots drawn by horses of irresistible speed kept ready. There were wonderful chariots covered with skins of lions and tigers, encrusted with ivory, gold and silver with ringing bells moving about. The palace was embellished with excellent seats and vessels with many precious gems. There were spacious places to accommodate big chariorts filled with shouts of great charioteers. It was pleasing with several kinds of beautiful beasts in their thousands all over. The place was full of beautful women, carefully protected by disciplined guards as well as demons. Full of the jewels of joyous women, the residence of the lord of demons reverberated with the jingling of their ornaments and accessories like the sound of the sea. The place was full of eminent demons with royal traits like a dense forest infested with lions. It carried the fragrance of agaru and sandal of good quality. Reverberating with the sounds of trumpets, mridangam and conches, there the demons daily performed worships and sacrifices on new and fullmoon days. The place produced deep sounds like the sea. Those mighty ogres wore gemstudded ornaments. The great vanara saw the residence of the great self, Ravana rich with precious gems. Hanuman, the great monkey, saw the royal mansion looking brilliant with elephants, horses and chariots. He thought that the palace was the very ornament of Lanka. He moved unnoticed into the close quarters of Ravana. Hanuman, the great monkey, saw the royal mansion looking brilliant with elephants, horses and chariots.

Courageous and swift, Hanuman sprang from Prahasta's house to Mahaparshva's, and so on. Then the great vanara leaped from the residence of Kumbhakarna which looked like a cloud to Vibhishana's. The great vanara leaped from Mahodara's to Virupaksha's, from Vidyujjihva's to Vidyunmali and then to Vajradanstra's. The brilliant leader of monkeys bounded to the house of Suka, to the clever Sarana's and to Indrajit's.

The heroic and powerful vanara saw at Ravana's residence demonesses with hideous eyes guarding the bed and an army of demons holding tridents, hammers, powerful javelins and iron cudgels. At his (Ravana's) residence, Hanuman also noticed troops of huge demons ready with different kinds of weapons. He saw horses of high speed in red, white and cream colours. He saw beautiful, wellbred elephants, which were not inferior to the enemy's. They were welltrained and had proved equal to Airavata (Indra's elephant) in battles. Resembling the thundering clouds, they were unassailable to the enemy in war and were trumpeting like a cluster of clouds. He saw horses of high speed in red, white and cream colours.

The palace of Ravana looked splendid with gems of different hues and with Ravana's presence, it was shining like the radiant Sungod. The leader of the vanaras saw there beds, seats and main vessels made of gold. Hanuman entered the delightful, lofty palace comparable to Kubera's mansion. It was filled with vessels encrusted with gems scattered all over. The floor was drenched with liquor. It was resonating with sounds of golden anklets of women and of drums. The rows of mansions, lofty palaces with welllaid apartments were full of hundreds of exquisite women.       Thus ends the sixth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Powerful Hanuman beheld the conglomeration of buildings with golden lattices encrusted with vaidurya, with flocks of birds comparable to a complex of clouds pierced by lightning during rainy season. Attached to the spacious halls of the houses, were storehouses for valuable  conches, weapons, bows and arrows. On the top of the attics on these mansions, were large and delightful terraces open to the Moon. The monkey saw numerous kinds of treasures, cherished by gods and demons, which were won by Ravana's might. The mansions of the lord of Lanka built with great care and  effort on earth were  by all means excellent  and appeared as though built personally by Maya (the divine architect wellknown for magical skills). Hanuman beheld the magnificent and soulcaptivating palace possessing the splendour of molten gold. Of matchless beauty, it looked like a towering cloud worthy of the might of Ravana, the lord of ogresses. It appeared splendid like a scattered piece of heaven on earth, glittering with countless gems. It looked like a mountain peak covered with pollen of flowers dropped from all kinds of trees. The aerial chariot was lit up by resplendent women just as a raincloud dazzles with flashes of lightning. It was auspicious, worthy of worship. It looked as if it was drawn by royal swans in the sky. A jewel among aerial chariots, it looked colourful with many gems beset. It appeared like the summit of a mountain decorated with the colours of minerals, like the sky bespangled with planets and the Moon and like a mass of multicoloured clouds adorned by a rainbow. The whole  earth had been picturised on it. It was filled with rows of mountains  and a canopy of trees all over. The trees were filled with lovely flowers with petals and filaments drawn on them. There were pictures of mansions white in colour and pools of crystalclear water filled with lovely flowers. There were pictures of beautiful lotuses drawn on it. There, the great Hanuman indeed saw a splendid chariot called Pushpaka. It was glowing with glittering gems. Taller than the biggest mansion, it was a great chariot. Inside were birds made of vaidurya, silver and corals. There were colourful serpents made of various gems, and highclass horses of exquisite limbs drawn. It had curved figures of birds with beautiful wings carved out of corals and gold The wings were shining as if they were really the wings of allies of Cupid, the god of love. He saw on it lotus ponds, artificial elephants with shapely trunks, offering to Laxmi who herself was a lotus, holding in her beautiful hands blue lotuses shining with filaments. Thus he reached the auspicious palace appearing like a beautiful mountain and stood wonderstruck. Once again he looked at that beautiful palace which appeared like a mountain with lovely caverns in spring time filled with wonderful fragrance Then Hanuman moved about that cherished city ruled by the strength of arms of the tenheaded king. Unable to find venerable Sita, who was deprived of the benefit of her husband's virtuous proximity, he became deeply sad. Unable to find Sita, the disciplined and foresighted Hanuman, who always kept the righteous path, felt distressed while moving about, his mind oppressed by all kinds of thought.       Thus ends the seventh sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The courageous son of the Windgod, Hanuman, the vanara saw the aerial chariot kept in the middle of the mansion inlaid with gems and diamonds latticed with artificial windows of barnished gold. The immeasurable Pushpaka fashioned by Visvakarma with images of incomparable beauty was not possible to describe. An excellent  product of his achievement, it was placed in the aerial path appearing as a beaconlight (signpost) in the orbit of the Sun. There was nothing in Pushpaka which was not executed carefully with special effort, nothing which was not made of precious stones. Such privileges were not available to even gods. Indeed there was nothing which was not unique. (The Pushpaka) was designed by dint of divine efforts and prowess (of Kubera). It could touch any place its master commanded with a cool mind. It had many beautiful places of rest. The Pushpaka was specially designed in a unique manner. It was decorated with many colourful peaks. It was delghtful and pleasing to the mind and bright like the autumnal fullmoon. It looked like a mountain with many wonderful towers around. The Pushpaka was borne by multitudes of Bhutas whose faces were shining with earrings, who were demons ranging in the night sky. They were gluttons endowed with great speed, and they had big, rolling and frightening eyes. That hero among monkeys, beheld the aerial chariot looking beautiful like a colourful collection of spring blossoms. Its appearance was more pleasant than spring itself.       Thus ends the eighth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The son of the Windgod, Hanuman, saw a huge, spacious and excellent of all mansions in the centre of the palace. The mansion of the lord of demons was a conglomeration of palaces half a yojana long and half a yojana wide. Hanuman, the subduer of enemies, went  around in search of  the largeeyed Vaidehi. Searching the excellent residences of important demons, Hanuman finally reached  the palace of the lord of ogres guarded by armed demons with elephants with two or three or four tusks. Searching the excellent residences of important demons, Hanuman finally reached  the palace of the lord of ogres guarded by armed demons with elephants with two or three or four tusks. Hanuman entered the palace of Ravana crowded with shedemons who were the wives of Ravana and the princesses brought by him after winning them in wars. To Hanuman, it looked like an ocean filled with crocodiles, sharks, whales, and a variety of fishes and snakes tossed by the force of the wind. Hanuman entered the palace of Ravana crowded with shedemons who were the wives of Ravana and the princesses brought by him after winning them in wars. To Hanuman, it looked like an ocean filled with crocodiles, sharks, whales, and a variety of fishes and snakes tossed by the force of the wind. Whatever wealth was possessed by Vaisravana (Kubera, the son of sage Vishrava) and also Indra who rides the Ucchaisrava green horse, was there in the palace of Ravana. The wealth stored in Ravana's palace was akin to what lay in the palaces of Kubera, Yama or Varuna, and ever more exquisite. Hanuman saw in the centre of that palace a complex of many wellbuilt houses. There was a wonderful aerial chariot called Pushpaka embellished with all kinds of gems built by Visvakarma for Brahma. It was the same one that Kubera had won from his grandfather, the creator Brahma, through his supreme penance. The lord of ogres acquired it (as a memento for his victory) by defeating Kubera with his might.

It was the same one that Kubera had won from his grandfather, the creator Brahma, through his supreme penance. The lord of ogres acquired it (as a memento for his victory) by defeating Kubera with his might. It was supported by finely built pillars of two types of gold (Kartaswara and Hiranmaya) with images of wolves carved on them and blazing. It was tall as if scraping the sky and resembled mountains like Meru and Mandara. It was graced with multitudes of  auspicious and decorated pleasurehouses everywhere. It was supported by finely built pillars of two types of gold (Kartaswara and Hiranmaya) with images of wolves carved on them and blazing. It was tall as if scraping the sky and resembled mountains like Meru and Mandara. It was graced with multitudes of  auspicious and decorated pleasurehouses everywhere. It was well built by Visvakarma and and had golden stairways, with radiant platforms glowing like fire and Sun. It had latticed windows made of gold inlaid with crystals. The platforms were encrusted with saphires called Indraneela and Mahaneela appropriately. It was shining bright with colourful corals, precious gems and peerless pearls fixed on its floor. It was bright like molten gold, fragrant with red sandal comparable to the rising Sun. Hanuman ascended the wonderful Pushpaka, welldecked with many corridors. There he smelt the stupefying, unearthly odour of food and drink. He felt as though the fragrance had taken a potentially solid form. (Note: The wind has no form. But when he carried the aroma of food and drink it appeared like the personification of wind which could be smelt.   fragrance comes from earth  the poet transmits the same to the wind who has got only  sense of touch). The fragrance was as if inviting the mighty hero like a relative inviting his kith and kin, saying 'come here' and leading him to a place where Ravana rested. Then he proceeded to an auspicious hall, which was Ravana's favourite like his chief queen dear to his heart. The stairways of the mansion were inlaid with special gems, windows were latticed with gold, floors were covered with crystals, figures of ivory with silver. It was decorated with pillars of silver and gold inlaid with pearls and corals and gems. It had highly ornamented pillars all over, some slightly bent and others straight. With lofty columns looking like wings it appeared as if the mansion had started on its journey to heaven. The floor was covered with a wide carpet spread from wall to wall with designs of different murals of many places and houses drawn in a row (garland like). The big carpet appeared like the expanse of earth itself. The mansion was resounding with the noise of birds singing in heat. It had wonderful fragrance. It was laid with exquisite tapestries and served as a dwelling place for the king of demons. It was smoky with fumes of agaru incence though spotless like a swan. It was colourful and radiant like Kamadhenu, the wishfulfilling cow, because of the offering of flowers. (The mansion) was so full of effulgence and soul ravishing that it served as an adornment even to splendour. It looked as though it banished all sorrow and was a source of prosperity. The chamber of Ravana, like a mother, gratified all the five senses of Hanuman with proper objects of the senses. 'This may be heaven or world of gods. It may be Amaravati, the abode of Indra or else it may be the supreme achievment (of the Creator), thought Maruti Seeing the golden lamps that stood burning steadily, Hanuman thought they looked like  gamblers in deep thought defeated by expert  gamblers in a game of dice. Hanuman fancied that the entire place was set ablaze with the glow of lamps, the lustre of Ravana and the brilliant glow of Ravana's ornaments (everything was shining). He found thousands of beautiful women seated on carpets wearing different clothes and garlands and dressed in various attires. Drinking and sporting until midnight, they had dropped off to sleeptired. Fast asleep, sounds of their ornaments silenced, the young women looked like a large bed of lotuses with swans and bees sitting calm without their usual noise. Hanuman looked at the faces of the wellbred young women with closed eyes and concealed teeth, fragrant like lotuses. The faces of the women looked like blooming lotuses at daybreak, their petals closed up again at night. The intoxicated bees would again and again long to enjoy these beautiful faces which were like blooming lotuses. The illustrious Hanuman felt it to be correct to compare those faces with lotuses for their fragrance. Brightened by (the beauty of) the maidens, the mansion shone like the autumnal sky endearing  and pleasing with stars. The lord of demons surrounded by women shone like the beautiful Moon encircled by stars. Seeing those women lying together Hanuman imagined them to be numerous meteors dropped from heaven after enjoying their merits, enjoyed and exhausted. It was clear that the grace and lustre of those women looked brilliant like the lustre and grace of brilliant stars releasing an auspicious glow. Garlands displaced and jewels scattered, they were drowsy due to drink and sexual exercise. A few young women had their circular vermilion mark (on the forehead) smudged, some had their anklets loosened and a few had their necklaces. Some had their strings of pearl broken, others had their clothes slipped off, and some had their waist belts snapped. They were like young mares fallen to rest after carrying heavy loads. With their good eartops broken and flower garlands crushed some looked like blooming creepers in a dense forest crushed by mighty elephants. The pearl chains, large and shining like rays of the Moon in the space between the breasts looked like sleeping swans. The vaidurya worn by women (on the breasts) looked like Kadamba birds while the golden chains put on by some others appeared like ruddy geese. Their hips were like river banks crowded with swans, karandava and Chakravaka birds shining like rivers. With their tiny bells round their girdle looking like buds, the bold golden ornaments like lotuses, their gestures of love like crocodiles and their radiant beauty like silver banks, the women looked like smoky rivers. The beautiful imprints made by the (heavy) ornaments on the tender limbs, breasts and nipples of some women appeared like many ornaments. Shaken by the breath released from their mouths the fringes of the garments of some women were drawn towards their faces again and againfluttering. The fringes of their garments glowing beautifully close to the faces of the wives (of Ravana) with different beautiful hues, shone splendid like flags. The eartops of some women endowed with auspicious charm were swinging softly generating a gentle sound by the touch of their breath. The sweet smell of wine emitted from their mouth and the natural fragrance of their breath was refreshing to Ravana  as if it was serving him at that time. Some women of Ravana (overcome by blind passion) smelt again and again the mouths of their cowives next to them  assuming it to be Ravana's. Even though the beautiful wives (should have been angry with their cowives for smelling their mouths) they behaved pleasingly, having no freedom to act with Ravana Some women slept pillowed on their arms, laying aside their adornments and others had their garment under the head as pillows and lay in sleep. Some women lay placing their arms on the breasts of the other while their own arms were used as pillow by another. One woman placed her head  on the lap of the other and slept. Given to intoxication and sex, the women slept touching one another's thighs, sides, hips, back and lap of the other, with their limbs intertwined. Knit with the shoulders of one another like a garland of flowers intertwined with the tipsy bees resting the women shone. The women of Ravana appeared like a garden in spring. They were as if a cluster of creepers blossomed in spring due to the caresses of the breeze. They were knit together as one string forming a garland, flowers of one creeper striking the other. The joints of these creepers had grown strong when tangled together. Shaken by the breeze, the bees resting on one creeper would go to the other. The women of Ravana appeared like a garden in spring.

The joints of these creepers had grown strong when tangled together. Shaken by the breeze, the bees resting on one creeper would go to the other. It was not possible to distinguish clearly between their jewels, limbs, garments and garlands and to place them in the right spots. When Ravana was happily asleep, the gods of light burning on the gold lampposts gazed without winking as it were, at the women, whom they dare  not gaze for fear of waking Ravana. The women halled from the families of royal sages, ancestral deities, daityas and demons who were infatuated with him. Many were brought by Ravana as captives of war and some came on their own deluded by lust. Except Sita no other woman among them had been taken there by force. They were won only on account of his valour and virtues. None loved any one earlier and none was married to others. None among them was born of a lowly family, nor lacked beauty, kindness, skill, strength or brightness. No one was not lovable to Ravana. 'If the lawful wife of Rama born of a good family can be allowed to remain with Rama in the same way as the consorts of the lord of demons, how fortunate it would be, thought the wise lord of monkeys'. Hanuman once again assuming his true form said to himself, 'Sita is surely a virtuous lady superior to and more distinguished than them all. Alas, this lord of Lanka committed an ignoble, act (by abducting her).       Thus ends the ninth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

He saw an exquisite couch made of gold shining wonderfully like the Sun. It was decorated with ashoka flowers. Women were holding fans of chamari deer.

The great vanara ascended the stairway and reached another altar and once again looked at the sleeping Ravana, the tiger among demons. While the lord of demons lay asleep on the magnificent couch, he  looked like the Prasravana hill with its elephant in rut. Hanuman saw the great Ravana's arms, which were like a pair of Indra's flag staff adorned with golden straps. The arms bore the marks of wounds caused by Airavata, (Indra's elephant), torn by the thunderbolt of Indra in war, and wounded by the discus of Lord Visnu. His strong, fleshy, wellbuilt arms, having auspicious thumbnails, shapely fingers and palms, pressed together, resembled the iron crowbars or beam used for main doors. The arms resembled elephant's trunks, tossed on a clean bed, resembling two fivehooded snakes (fingers like hoods), besmeared with cool, fragrant, red sandalpaste of excellent quality which looked red like the hare's blood. They were well massaged  by the best of women with fine, fragrant sandal paste. They were the arms which could make yakshas, pannagas, gods and demons roar in fear at their sight.

The vanara, gazed at the arms of Ravana placed on the couch that appeared like two angry snakes asleep in a cave on (the lap) of mount Mandara. The lord of demons looked splendid like a mountain with his long, fully developed arms. He appeared like Mandara mountain with two lofty peaks. The breath released from the huge mouth of that lion of demons carried the fragrance of mango and punnaga as well as excellent Bakula flowers. It exuded the aroma of rich and delicious food and different drink. It was as though pervading the whole chamber.

His shining headgear studded with gold and pearls was set aside. His fleshy, broad chest on which the pearl necklace had slightly receded from its position(as he was asleep)  was shining along with the red sandal paste. He had put on a splendid white silken cloth which had also slipped a little and was covered with exquisitely  rich yellow upper garment. His eyes were bloodred. His body was comparable to a heap of blackbeans. He was sighing heavily like a hissing snake. He appeared like an elephant sleeping on the banks of the great river Ganges. With four golden lamps glowing on four sides of the bed,the four directions were illuminated. All his limbs lit up bright (with the glow of lamps), he looked like a cloud with streaks of lightning.

Hanuman, the leader of vanaras found the wives of Ravana,  whose  faces were bright as the Moon, adorned with beautiful earrings and fresh floral garlands. Hanuman saw  the women there wearing fine jewellery, performing dances, playing musical instruments, and resting on the lap or leaning on the arms of the demon king. He noticed on the earlobes of the the women gold earrings decked with diamonds and vaidurya. They were wearing shining armlets of gold. There the beautiful moonlike faces of women Illumined by the lovely earrings lay on the cot which looked resplendent like the sky lit up with hosts of stars. Exhausted by drinking and indulging in amorous sport, the consorts of Ravana slept here and there with their visible slender waists. Another woman exceedingly beautiful and a delicate danseuse of beautiful complexion and rhythmic movements held her limbs in a dancing posture (though asleep) due to her habit . Another woman slept hugging her veena. She shone like a lotus plant flung in a large river, clinging on to a boat. (Veena is compared to a boat and the woman to a lotusplant in the ambience of flowing waters of the river. The entire hall had put up such a dynamic view showing hectic life of the inmates). A woman with dark eyes asleep with a drum placed in her armpit looked like a beautiful mother holding her loving baby (the drum was hung to her arm with a rope). Another charming beauty endowed with beautiful breasts lay hugging a tambourine as though a passionate woman lay embracing her lover whom she secured after a long time. Yet another lotuseyed lady slept embracing a lute as if a lovelorn woman lay clasping her lover. Another selfpossessed lady, graceful in dance, holding a sevenstringed lute  was as though lying asleep with her beloved. Another lady with drunken eyes lay fast asleep holding a drum close to her beautiful bosom with her soft limbs. (These images show that these women were singing and dancing till late night and slept exhausted). Another lady of slender belly, who had been exhausted by drunkeness was lying with a tabor pressed to her bosom and inserted in her armpit. One lovely woman and another held a drum and slept as if they were hugging their young child. Yet another with her eyes like lotus petals deluded with passion tightly held in her arms a musical instrument known as Adambaram and slept. Another lovely lady was fast asleep, having turned a goblet of water  aside, yet another lay like a garland of variegated flowers in spring season. Overcome with sleep another woman lay pressing with her own hands her golden gobletlike breasts. One woman with eyes like lotus petals and face like the fullmoon embraced another young woman of beautiful hips  and slept tipsy with drink. Some charming maidens held wonderful musical instruments pressing against their bosom and slept like passionate women embracing their loved ones. Hanuman saw some maidens lying on separate excellent beds, women richly  endowed with beautysleeping. Then the vanara saw  a very beautiful woman of golden complexion decked with pearls and gems and with ornaments as if illuminating the excellent mansion with her splendour She was the king's favourite and the chief queen, Mandodari. Then the vanara saw  a very beautiful woman of golden complexion decked with pearls and gems and with ornaments as if illuminating the excellent mansion with her splendour She was the king's favourite and the chief queen, Mandodari. On seeing her embellished with ornaments, beauty and charm, the long armed son of the Windgod, the chief of the vanaras thought her to be Sita and rejoiced. He rejoiced clapping his palms, kissing his tail and jumping up, climbing up the pillars and jumping down on the ground in joy. Thus he exhibited his monkey nature.       Thus ends the tenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The great vanara, having rejected his judgement, started thinking again. 'Lovely Sita, being away from Rama, will not sleep, will not eat or drink or adorn herself. How can she approach any other man even if he is the king of gods for there is none equal to Rama even among gods'. Having thus decided, Hanuman strolled about the banquet hall. 'Lovely Sita, being away from Rama, will not sleep, will not eat or drink or adorn herself. How can she approach any other man even if he is the king of gods for there is none equal to Rama even among gods'. Having thus decided, Hanuman strolled about the banquet hall. Some women were fatigued after sporting, similarly some were exhausted after singing. Others were tired through dancing and some were worn out by continuous drinking. Some women reclined on tabors, some on murajas, and some on drums and hassocks while some slept on excellent couches. The monkey leader saw thousands of  beautiful women asleep after long dalliance. Some of them were adorned with ornaments, some were good at arguments and versed in the appreciation of songs, some were aware of the appropriate time and place and some were adept in right expressions.

Some of them were adorned with ornaments, some were good at arguments and versed in the appreciation of songs, some were aware of the appropriate time and place and some were adept in right expressions. In the midst of these women the longarmed lord of demons shone like a (majestic) bull in a big cowshed. Surrounded by the women, the demon king shone like a proud elephant attended by many female elephants scattered in a dense forest. The tiger among vanaras saw at the great Ravana's palace a drinking place where everything one desires was provided. There at the drinking hall the meat of deer, buffaloes and boars portioned and placed. The tiger among vanaras also saw there meat of peacocks and chicken placed in large golden vessels, some half eaten. Hanuman saw the meat of pigs and jungle fowls, deer, peacocks and bones marinated with yoghurt and special kinds of salt. He saw several kinds of (nonvegetarian) food like cooked meat of fowls, ruddy geese, buffaloes, goats, fishes as well as food for licking. (Food is of four kinds  1)  which can be chewed 2)  ordinary solid, semisolid food which can be consumed  3)  food for licking  4)  liquid food (which can be sipped)).

The banquet hall looked splendid with food seasoned with salt and sour ingredients. There was ragashadavas (syrup made with grapes, pomegranates, different juices like half ripe mangoes and seasoned with ginger cardomom, butter etc). Heavy chains, anklets and shouldersstraps were thrown aside. (The people relaxed while eating and drinking and discarded heavy ornaments). Many glasses were found scattered or drinks spilt on the floor after use.Many fruits and flowers were kept. The banquet hall looked splendid with food seasoned with salt and sour ingredients.

The place appeared as if it was glowing witout fire. In the banquet hall there were many types of meat arranged in a number of ways. They were cooked by experts by seasoning them with choicest ingredients. There were many types of wonderful and pleasing wine extracted from sugarcane, honey , fruits and flowers. They were good even though fermented and made delicious by seasoning with aromatic spices. (The banquet hall) appeared beautiful with many kinds of garlands arranged in different locations. Also there were vessels made of pure gold, crystalware and jars spread all over. (The banquet hall) appeared beautiful with many kinds of garlands arranged in different locations. Also there were vessels made of pure gold, crystalware and jars spread all over. Hanuman saw the best of wines in large quantities kept in silver and pure gold pots.  The great monkey saw the wine jars made of gold and silver studded with crystals and gems. He saw wine jars at one place, some fully drained, and at another place not touched at all. He moved about looking at different types of eatables and drinks arranged separately along with the left over food. At some places he saw broken pots, at other places rolling pots and elsewhere flower garlands strewn and mixed up with water and fruits. Hanuman saw many beds some unused and some occupied by lovely women sleeping, embracing one another. Overcome with sleep some women pulled clothes of other women and covered their bodies with them. The lovely clothes and garlands on the bodies of women were moving mildly by their exhalations as if shaken by the gentle breeze. With the many scents of cool sandal, of sweetsmelling wines of diverse kinds, as well as flower garlands of several types and of incense burning in that hall, the cool wind blew spreading several fragrances all over. The wind wafting through the Pushpaka chariot carried the fragrance of the cool sandalpaste used in bath and the sweet smell of wines and thick smoke of fragrance spread further. There in the demons abode were women who were fair, some lovely with dark and others with golden complexion. Withered due to indulgence in sex they were overcome with sleep. The charm of the women was like the lotus creepers with closed lotuses . Brilliant Hanuman ransacked the harem of Ravana but found no Janaki. The great monkey was very much worried as he thought he had transgressed the moral code by watching the women. 'Observing the wives of others in this manner in their inner chambers very much amounts to transgression of moral code  by me'. ( thought he) 'I did see these wives of another, but not with a sensual mind. I have only seen them but not with foul intention'. Another  bright idea struck the highly sensible Hanuman, who had a clear vision of the task ahead-- 'I was firm and singleminded in my direction regarding the task ahead' (thought he). 'It is true I saw all the loyal wives of Ravana but without any foul desire. Indeed in my mind no passionate feeling was ever aroused'. 'Mind propels the sense organs to do good or bad deeds. (But) my mind is firmly esatablished in righteousness'. 'It is not possible for me to look for Vaidehi elsewhere. During such search operations one always looks for women among women.' 'One has to search a creature among its own species. It is not possible to find a lost woman in the herd of female deer'. 'I searched all over Ravana's harem with a pure mind but I have not seen Janaki'. Even while valiant Hanuman was looking among the daughters of gods, gandharvas and nagas he could not find Janaki. Heroic Hanuman, unable to find Sita among the women, moved aside and started thinking. Illustrious Hanuman left the banquet hall to renew his effort in search of Sita.       Thus ends the eleventh sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Anxious to find Sita, Hanuman revisited the bowers of creepers, picture galleries and domitories located in the midst of the mansion, but  did not find that beautiful Sita. The great monkey, unable to find the beloved of Rama thought Sita might not be surviving. So he started thinking, ' I could not see her even though I have searched all over'. 'Janaki, follower of noble path, anxious to protect her chastity must have been killed by the wicked demon king. 'The daughter of Janaka might have collapsed out of fear, looking at the distorted faces of ugly, tall and monstrous demon maids of Ravana. 'I have spent a long time with vanaras. I have not  succeded in my efforts to find Sita. I dare not see Sugriva now without finding Sita and without fulfilling my task. Sugriva will punish me severely. There is no way out.' 'I have searched all over the harem. Ravana's women have been seen. (Yet) I have not been able to see noble Sita. My efforts have been wasted'. 'What will the vanaras say when I return? What should I speak when they ask me: O hero, what did you accomplish there?' 'Since the time limit has exceeded and Janaki is not spotted, surely the vanaras would sit and wait unto death. What am I going to say'? 'What will the elderly Jambavan say? What will young prince Angada and other vanaras collected there say when I reach the seashore to meet them'. Wise Hanuman once again declared, 'being free from despair is the root cause of prosperity. Freedom from despondency gives supreme happiness and leads to success'. 'The action of a living being certainly bears fruit. Therefore, I shall put forth my best effort without feeling despondent. I will once again search everywhere in Lanka ruled  by Ravana'. 'I have searched the banquet halls, bowers of creepers, picture galleries and gymnasiums. I have searched everywhere through the paths of gardens and mansions, harems and the Pushpaka chariot also. 'I have searched the banquet halls, bowers of creepers, picture galleries and gymnasiums. I have searched everywhere through the paths of gardens and mansions, harems and the Pushpaka chariot also. Thinking thus, he started searching once again the basement cells, temples, homes within homes. The great vanara searched all over again and again jumping up and down, stopping for a while and moving, opening and closing doors, by crossing, entering and exiting, jumping up and down. Thus he moved about and searched whereever there was scope to search The great vanara searched all over again and again jumping up and down, stopping for a while and moving, opening and closing doors, by crossing, entering and exiting, jumping up and down. Thus he moved about and searched whereever there was scope to search Even a space of four fingers in the inner chambers of Ravana was not left out in his search for Sita. He moved in the lanes inside the boundary walls, around the shrines, altars, wells and tanks whereever it was possible to look for. Hanuman could see only ogresses of different typesugly, deformed but could not find the daughter of Janaka. Hanuman could see even the women of vidyadharas who were matchless in beauty among women in the world but not Janaki the beloved of Raghava. Hanuman could see there moonfaced daughters of nagas with charming limbs but not the slimwaisted Sita. Hanuman saw the daghters of nagas kidnapped by Ravana forcibly after victory in war but not Sita, the delight of Janaka. The longarmed Hanuman, son of the Windgod was able to see other great women but not Sita. So he became despondent. The son of the Wind god, the great monkey realised the futility of his efforts in crossing the sea. He brooded again. Hanuman, son of the Windgod, came out of the aerial chariot, mind stricken with grief and started thinking again.        Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman, the vanara leader, jumped from the aerial chariot to the boundary wall like a flash of lightning in the clouds. Going round the palace of Ravana, unable to see Janaka's daughter Sita, Hanuman spoke thus to himself: \"I have thoroughly surveyed the entire city of Lanka to please Rama, but I am unable to find Sita of flawless beauty. \"I have searched for Sita thoroughly in waterlogs, lakes, tanks, streams and rivers and all over the woods and among mountains that are difficult to reach. I have searched all over the land but have not been able to find Janaki. \"Sampati, king of vultures had said that Sita is at Ravana's palace. But I have not been able to see her. \"Can it be that Mythili, daughter of Janaka, dejected and helpless succumbed to the evil intentions of Ravana. \"Or, perhaps she might have been dropped midway from the hold of Ravana while he was flying at great speed, afraid of the deadly arrows of Rama? \"Or, perhaps while being borne away on the path frequented by siddhas, the beloved of Rama might have fallen down (dead), heart broken, on seeing the (vast) sea. \"He thinks, on account of the high speed during the flight of Ravana under the pressure of his arms, the noble, largeeyed lady might have given up her life. \"Surely, she might have fallen into the sea while wriggling in her effort to extricate herself from the hold of Ravana as he was flying over the sea. \"Oh poor Sita, distanced from relations, while protecting her chastity helplessly she might have been devoured by cruel Ravana. \"Or else, the pious, blackeyed Sita might have been eaten by the the cruelnatured wives of the lord of demons. \"Or, she might have attained death, meditating on Rama, whose face resembles the fullmoon and eyes the lotus petals. \"Or, Vaidehi, the princess of Mithila might have cast off her life grieving intensely and crying, 'Alas, Rama, alas, Lakshmana, alas, Ayodhya'. (Mithila is the name of the  capital city and Videha is the country which was ruled by Janaka. Sita, the princess is known as Vaidehi, Mythili and Janaki). \"Or, I think Sita might have been imprisoned in a cage like a myna in Ravana's palace. She will be surely crying. \"How could Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, Rama's wife, the lady with a beautiful waist and eyes like lotus petals, come under the fold of Ravana? \"Whether Janaki is lost or irretrievable or dead is not known The news should not be  reported to Rama, who is very fond of his wife. \"To carry or not to carry this news to Rama would be a mistake. What shall I do? I am facing a tough situation. \"I wonder what the right course of action is when things have taken such a turn? What is proper for me to do? Hanuman once again deliberated. \"If I return to Kishkinda without seeing Sita of what use is my effort? What have I accomplished? What will happen? (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha are the four Purusharthas or accomplishments in life) \"My crossing the ocean, my entry into Lanka and my survey of the demons are all futile. \"What will Sugriva or even the vanaras and the two sons of Dasaratha say when I reach Kishkinda? \"If I report the most unpleasant news that Sita was not found, Rama will give up his life. \"Seeing Rama in such a painful state, wise Lakshmana who has given his life to Rama, to whom he is deeply devoted will also not survive. \"On hearing the death of both the brothers Bharata will also die. On seeing this Satrughna will also not live. \"On seeing that Rama has ended his life, the grateful and truthful monkey leader, Sugriva will give up his life. \"Distressed, disheartened, pained and grieved on account of her husband's death, the virtuous lady Ruma (wife of Sugriva) will be unhappy and die. \"Tara who is troubled by Vali's death and tortured with grief will not live when king Sugriva dies. \"On account of his parents death and also because of Sugriva's calamity, Angada will give up his life. \"The grief due to the death of their king will make the vanaras hit their heads with their palms and fists. \"The vanaras who were reared by the king's kind words, gifts and care will give up their life. \"The chiefs among vanaras together will not enjoy their life in the forest or mountains or caves. \"Tormented by their king's death the vanaras with their wives, sons and ministers will drop down from the mountain peaks on the rough ground and die. \"The vanaras will put an end to their lives by poisoning or by hanging or by selfimmolation or by killing themselves with weapons or by fasting unto death. \"If I go there (without finding Sita), it will cause destruction of the Ikshvakus and vanaras would weep. It would be dreadful. \"I will not go to the city of Kishkinda from here or to Sugriva without finding Mythili. It will not be possible for me to face him. Both the highsouled warrior princes treading a righteous path as well as the vanaras will survive with a hope of my return if I stay back. \"If Janaki is not found I will stay here and live like a hermit subsisting on whatever is available on this sea shore, which has abundance of roots, fruits and water. \"If Janaki is not found I will stay here and live like a hermit subsisting on whatever is available on this sea shore, which has abundance of roots, fruits and water. \"I will prepare a pyre  and enter the fire  so that sea waves wash off the ashes or crows and beasts will eat up my body while i sit fasting unto death. \"I shall enter water and drown myself to death if I am not able to find Janaki. I think this way of ending life has been suggested by great ascetics. My glory which had a good start (in the form of bringing Rama to Sugriva) and brought fortune to Sugriva and fame to me has been snapped as I could not find Sita. \"I will remain an ascetic and do penance under the tree practising selfcontrol and not go back without seeing the blackeyed Sita. \"Besides, if I go back without finding Sita all the vanaras including Angada will die. \"If I commit suicide, I will earn numerous sins. By being alive, I can witness auspicious events. Therefore, I will live, for, happiness can come only to the living. The elephant among monkeys (Hanuman) worrying over and over again, holding his head for long could not reach the end of his grief. \"I will kill Ravana, this mighty, tenheaded demon. Sita was indeed carried away by him. This (killing him) can be a fitting reply to his evil action. My desire would be fulfilled. \"Or else, I shall carry him across the sea and put him before Rama like a bull as if he is a sacrificial prey to lord Siva.\" Distressed over his inability to find Sita, Hanuman's mind was overcome with anxiety and he started thinking further. \"Till I find the virtuous Sita, wife of Rama in this Lanka, I shall keep searching everywhere again and again. \"Had I brought Raghava following  the words of Sampati, Rama would have burnt all vanaras unable to find his wife. \"I will stay here itself, restricting my food and controlling my senses. Let not men and monkeys perish for my fault. \"Here is the Ashoka grove with huge trees. I will go there. I have not looked for her in this place. \"I shall offer salutations to Vasus, Rudras Adityas and Aswinis and proceed to  increase (cause) the sorrow of the demons. (There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, two Ashwins and fortynine Windgods). \"I will conquer all the ogres and pass them to Sita, the delight of the Ikshvaku family  as an offering and give Rama to her as the fruit of her austerities.\" The brilliant son of the Windgod, Hanuman, whose senses were overwhelmed with worries, regained his senses in a short while and got up. \"My salutations to Lakshmana, Rama and divine daughter of Janaka. Salutations to Rudra, Indra, Yama and Vayu. Salutations to Sun, Moon and Maruts\" Having offered salutations to all gods as well as to Sugriva, he looked at all quarters and left for the Ashoka grove. Hanuman started thinking again about his task after reaching the auspicious Ashoka grove. 'This Ashoka grove filled with many trees, guarded by many demons is carefully tended. It must be sacred. \"The guards posted there are surely protecting the grove. The divinity  pervading all over me (the wind) must also have been controlled as it is also not blowing violently. I have turned my body small for Rama's cause and also to save myself from Ravana. May all sages, gods, the selfborn Brahma, Windgod, Indra, the wielder of thunderbolt whose name is invoked in sacrifices, Yama, who carries a rope, Varuna give success and Lord Siva help me. May the Sun, Moon, Aswinis  Marutas assist me. May the gods of the quarters and the lord of all beings help me to succeed. May those whom I could not see also bring success to me.

'Oh when and how would I behold that beautiful noble lady of stainless character, with a Moonlike face, prominent nose, white teeth, pleasant smile and with eyes like lotus petals? \"How will I set my eyes on that gentle, frail and suffering thing now, who has been abducted by that mean, cruel sinner of dreadful look?\"       Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Mighty Hanuman lost in thought for a moment, jumped down (the harem) to the boundary wall of the palace. Standing on the boundary wall, the great vanara contracted his body and observed the blossoms on several tree tops---- Salas, lovely Ashoka trees and blossoms of champak, uddalaka, naga, mangoes with their fruits crimson as the snout of a monkey, it being the beginning of Spring. Standing on the boundary wall, the great vanara contracted his body and observed the blossoms on several tree tops---- Salas, lovely Ashoka trees and blossoms of champak, uddalaka, naga, mangoes with their fruits crimson as the snout of a monkey, it being the beginning of Spring. He penetrated like an arrow released from a bow the cluster of trees covering mango grove and overgrown with hundreds of creepers. Entering deep into the grove, Hanuman saw clusters of trees pleasing to look at, herds of animals and flocks of colourful birds singing melodious notes.The grove was surrounded on all sides by silvery and golden trees which looked colourful with flocks of birds and herds of deer. It was full of lovely thickets looking like the rising sun. It was fringed with various trees bearing abundance of fruits and flowers. It was inhabited by intoxicated cuckoos, bees,  proud peacocks and numerous lovely birds.

It was inhabited by intoxicated cuckoos, bees,  proud peacocks and numerous lovely birds. The vanara who went searching for the paragon of virtue born of a noble family, awakened the birds who were happily asleep in their nests. As the birds flew away, the trees hit by the wings of birds showered flowers of different colours. Covered with flowers, Hanuman shone like a mountain of flowers in the midst of Ashoka grove.  Beholding that sprightly monkey running in all directions, its body covered with variegated blossoms fallen from the trees, all living beings there thought that it was Spring personified  Strewn with flowers of various colours fallen from the trees of various kinds, the goddess of earth looked charming like a young woman profusely bedecked.  Shaken vigorously by Hanuman of great speed, the trees shed their blooms of variegated colours. The tree tops, shorn of their leaves and flowers and fruits fallen, appeared like gamblers who had lost their stakes and had to lay down their clothes and ornaments. Shaken by the swift Hanuman, even the big trees dropped flowers, fruits and leaves. Deserted by the flocks of birds resting on them (flowers and leaves also dropped from branches), the trees were left bare with trunks unable to move. The garden of Ashoka with trees shattered and crushed by Hanuman's tail,  hands and feet, appeared like a woman with dishevelled hair, with her vermilion mark effaced, her bright teeth and lips faded for being kissed and wounded with nails and bitten with teeth (by her lover).

Hanuman shook with tremendous speed the huge clusters of creepers hanging there just like stormy wind in rainy season scatters masses of clouds on the Vindhya mountain. Roaming there the monkey noticed the beautiful floors paved with gems, gold and silver  He observed ponds of different shapes filled with clear water with steps paved with rich gems, with sands of pearls and corals and bottoms of crystal, which contained beds of lotuses in bloom, adorned with chakravaka birds and resonant with cacklings of swans and sarasas and vatyuhas rubbing their beaks. There were golden platforms built on banks and platforms built of crystals. There were trees on the bank of streams, and nectarlike sacred waters flowing in them surrounded by hundreds of creepers, and Ashoka blossoms scattered everywhere, with thickly grown bushes of different kinds, with lilies in bloom in tanks.

Not far from there, Hanuman, son of the Windgod sighted lotus ponds filled with different kinds of water birds. Hanuman saw an oblong pond, full of cool water provided with steps, embellished with gems and beautified with pearl dust as sand on its bank.  Thronged with many kinds of animals, it looked colourful with large mansions constructed by Visvakarma in the artificial woodlands decorated all over.

There the trees had abundance of flowers and fruits. A few trees were full of leaves and branches spread like parasols. There were raised golden platforms.

The monkey leader saw one simsupa tree covered all over with canopies of many climbers and leaves. The tree was surrounded by golden platforms. He beheld several pieces of land and streams flowing out of the springs. He also noticed golden trees asresplendent as fire. He saw trees resplendent with golden radiance and thought that he was in the midst of gold like the Sungod getting golden hue by the radiance of Meru, the golden mountain. Hanuman was wonderstruck to hear the sound produced by rows of golden trees which stood round the simsupa tree. This sound resembled the tinkling of a hundred anklets when the wind passed through (their leaves). Strongarmed Hanuman climbed up the simsupa tree shining with flowers on its top and surrounded by tender sprouts and leaves. (He said to himself): \"I may see by chance( from this point) Vaidehi tormented with grief anxiously waiting to see Rama while moving about here and there casually. \"Surely this beautiful Ashoka grove with delightful champak, chandan and bakula trees belongs to the wicked Ravana.\" \"This lovely lotuspond is frequented by flocks of aquatic birds. Surely Rama's queen Janaki will come to this place. \"Beautiful Janaki, beloved queen of Rama loves to wander in forests. She will surely visit this grove. \"Or may be that doeeyed noble lady brooding over Rama will come to this garden she   is familiar with. \"That lovelyeyed queen tormented with grief over separation from Rama will be coming here to stay as she always loves strolling in the forest. \"The daughter of Janaka, the  chaste wife of Rama,  used to for the company of those creatures wandering in the forest. Surely that lady of lovely complexion, the beautiful Janaki will come to this river flowing with sacred waters for performing the evening rituals. To the auspicious Sita,the beloved of Rama, the lord of the world, this Ashoka grove is a befitting place. \"The moonfaced queen will certainly come to this stream of  auspicious water if she is surviving.\" Pondering thus, the highsouled Hanuman remained concealed on the tree loaded with flowers and leaves and waited, looking eagerly for the wife of the lord of the people.       Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman looked out from the simsupa tree all around for Mythili scanning the ground below. Hanuman surveyed from the Simsupa tree the Ashoka grove of trees full of fine fragrance. It looked welldecorated  like the Nandana garden of Indra. It teemed with animals and birds. It was filled with the voices of the cuckoos. It had tall mansions and underground chamber. There were golden lilies and lotuses in the lakes, enchanting couches with rich coverings and trees full of blossoms of all seasons and fruits in abundance With the  Ashoka tree shedding showers of flowers from time to time the place shone with the splendour of Sunrise. It glittered like inflamed fire. The Ashoka tree had  hundreds of colourful birds on the branches. It appeared as if it had branches without leaves which made them look like earornaments (of the grove). Ashoka flowers in bloom hung down to the base of the tree as if to take away the grief of the onlookers. The blossoms of the Karnikara and kimsuka brightened the whole grove.

The grove shone bright as if it were inflamed fire with beautiful trees like purnaga, saptaparna, champak and uddalaka in full bloom. There were thousands of ashoka trees some of which shone like gold, others like the flames of fire and some dark as collyrium. The grove with different types of gardens spread over looked like the Nandana garden of Indra and Chaitraratha garden of Kubera. It surpassed every other garden. It was unimaginable in splendour. It was divine and delightful filled with the radiance of countless varieties of blossoms shining like stars, like a second firmament. It was like another ocean filled with precious gems of flowers.

It gleamed white like mount Kailasa. Its stairs were paved with corals. The altars were made of brightly polished gold. This structure glowing with brilliance was as if stealing the eyes.

Then he beheld a lady surrounded by female demons. Clad in soiled clothes she looked dejected, emaciated through fasting and was sighing repeatedly. She appeared thin and pale like the crescent Moon at the beginning of the bright fortnight. Her form was faintly recognisable. She had a lovely radiance on account of her beautiful form. She looked like the tip of burning fire engulfed in a cloud of smoke. She was wearing an excellent single yellow cloth which was soiled. Unadorned, she looked like a muddy lotuspond bereft of lotuses. She was bashful, tormented with agony, dejected with a withered look. She appeared like the star Rohini oppressed by planet Mars. Her face was filled with tears. She looked dejected and emaciated due to fasting. Always plunged in grief, she looked like one meditating in tears. Unable to see her dear kith and kin, she sat guarded by ogresses. She appeared like a doe separated from the herd and encircled by a pack of hounds. She (from behind) appeared like the earth covered with a range of trees at the end of rainy season with her single long black braid touching her hips looking like a black serpent. She who deserved to be happy and had not experienced worries was burning in grief. ( is a trait of a  Sita who was forced to stay in Lanka was a  .) After seeing the largeeyed lady worn out and dressed in soiled clothes, Hanuman started deliberating in himself and guessed it was Sita for strong reasons. Beholding the form of the largeeyed lady, Hanuman guessed, 'This is similar to the form seen while the demon was kidnapping her'. Her face resembled the fullmoon which dispelled the encircling gloom by its radiance. She had a slender waist, beautiful round breasts, shapely eyebrows, red lips, dark hair, and eyes like lotus petals with attractive limbs. She was comparable to Rati, consort of Cupid. Her face resembled the fullmoon which dispelled the encircling gloom by its radiance. She had a slender waist, beautiful round breasts, shapely eyebrows, red lips, dark hair, and eyes like lotus petals with attractive limbs. She was comparable to Rati, consort of Cupid. Just as the radiance of the full moon is cherished by all, this lady was liked by every one in this world. With her lovely figure she was seated on the ground like an austere ascetic. The timid lady was hissing (sighing) like the consort of the serpent king, who being caught in a widespread cobweb of grief was looking gloomy. She was like the flames of fire obscured by smoke. She appeared like the text of Smriti of doubtful meaning, a treasure that has been thrown away She was like faith shattered, hope frustrated, desires blocked by obstacles, success vitiated, fame marred and intellect blurred. She appeared like fame besmirched by false allegation. She was pained by the obstruction to meet Rama and emaciated by  abduction. The fawneyed lady was looking here and there with her dark, curved eyelashes. Her unhappy face was streaming with tears. The fawneyed lady was looking here and there with her dark, curved eyelashes. Her unhappy face was streaming with tears. Covered with dirt and mud and shorn of adornments even though she deserved them, she looked wretched like the radiance of the Moon muffled by dark clouds. Hanuman did recognise Sita after looking at her carefully again and again even as one is able to make out knowledge of shastriclore forgotten with lapse of time and lack of practice. Just as an unclear expression which has undergone certain changes in meaning due to lack of usage over a long period is understood by virtue of previous practice so also Hanuman had difficulty in recognising Sita who was devoid of any decoration. After close observation of different signs and deliberation with reasons he came to the conclusion that the largeeyed lady is the same blameless princess Sita. Hanuman observed the ornaments worn by Vaidehi adding grace to her limbs which Rama had described.They were wellcrafted earrings and wellfit Savdamshtras. He noticed wonderful, variegated ornaments of corals and gems as well as those worn on hands. They were blackened for long wear and Sita had marks of wearing them on her body. (Note: This is a pair ornaments shaped like dog's teeth. It is not known on which part of the body they were worn).

(Note: This is a pair ornaments shaped like dog's teeth. It is not known on which part of the body they were worn). \"I think these ornaments are the same that were described by Rama.

Those dropped (by Sita) are not found on her body. These were not dropped.There is no doubt.\" \"The shining yellow upper garment like a golden cloth was torn. Flung down, it stuck to a tree which the monkeys noticed. \"The jingling, choice ornaments were thrown down on the ground. \"This cloth worn long is crumpled. Even then it has retained its shine and looks fresh. \"This lady of golden complexion is Rama's beloved queen who does not disappear from his mind, although away. \"She is that same lady for whom Rama has been passing through compassion, benevolence, grief and passion. He is compassionate considering her a woman, kind and benevolent since she is his dependent, stricken with grief for losing a wife and passionate since she is his beloved. \"She is that same lady for whom Rama has been passing through compassion, benevolence, grief and passion.

For this reason she and the righteous self (Rama) are able to survive till this moment. \"Lord Rama had accomplished a difficult task in sustaining the body this way without allowing it to sink and perish during separation from her. \"Rama, the strongarmed hero has accomplished a difficult task by surviving even for a moment without this Sita who has intoxicating lustre\".",
                "Hanuman, the bull among monkeys, admired the laudable Sita and the virtuous Rama and once again began to lament. Sagacious Hanuman, eyes dimmed with tears, thought for a short while on the plight of Sita and lamented \"If Sita, who is worshipped by righteous Lakshmana and loved by Rama is tortured like this, it shows it is difficult to trangress the force of time. \"Just as river Ganga is not agitated by the rainbearing clouds, this Sita is not perturbed as she is aware of the prowess of Rama and might of Lakshmana. \"Sri Rama matches Vaidehi perfectly in character, age, behaviour, birth and auspicious signs. She is aware that he is the right person for her. Rama deserves Vaidehi and this blackeyed lady deserves him.\" On seeing her glowing like fresh gold resembling goddess Lakshmi who is dear to the entire world, and thinking of Rama, Hanuman said: \"It was for the sake of this largeeyed Sita that the powerful Vali and the heroic Kabandha who was equal to Ravana in heroism were killed. \"Rama  killed Viradha of fearsome valour in the forest like Sambara by Indra. \"Ogres like Khara and Trisira and the powerful Dooshana were kileed in battle by Rama endowed with selfknowledge. On her account Sugriva obtained the coveted kingdom ruled by Vali which was a difficult proposition, and retained supremacy in the world. \"On account of the largeeyed Sita I ventured to cross  the lord of rivers, the sea, and came to this city. \"Even if Rama turns this land stretching to the ocean upside down or even the entire world on account of her, it is justifiable, according to me. \"The sovereignty over the three worlds will weigh less than one sixteenth part of Janaka's daughter, Sita. She had risen from the land when tilled by the plough and was covered with auspicious paddy dust resembling the pollen grains of lotuses, this daughter of Janaka, the great righteous ruler of Mithila, This lady with unswerving devotion to her husband. She had risen from the land when tilled by the plough and was covered with auspicious paddy dust resembling the pollen grains of lotuses, this daughter of Janaka, the great righteous ruler of Mithila, This lady with unswerving devotion to her husband. \"This celebrated lady is the eldest daughterinlaw of the noble, valiant king Dasaratha who never returned from the battleground without being victorious. \"She is the loving wife of the righteous, grateful, wise and selfrealised Rama. She has fallen into the hands of these shedemons. \"On account of her immense love towards her husband she has given up all kinds of luxuries, not caring for suffering. She was satisfied with fruits and roots in the desolate forest. Engaged in serving her husband, she experienced utmost joy as in her own palace. A lady of golden complexion who had not experienced suffering earlier is subjected to sorrow and is tolerating calamities in this way \"On account of her immense love towards her husband she has given up all kinds of luxuries, not caring for suffering.

Deprived of all sensual pleasures, and separated from her relatives, she is surviving with the hope of meeting them. She is looking at neither the shedemons nor these trees full of flowers and fruits. She is surely thinking of Rama with a singleminded  attention. \"Indeed, the husband is the greatest ornament for a married woman. Hence though deserving adornment she does not like it, bereft of her husband who is her only ornament. \"Lord Rama indeed performs a difficult task in surviving without her. That he is not feeling despondent is a wonder. Sita who is endowed with beautiful dark hair and eyes like a hundredpetalled lotus, who deserves to be happy is in sorrow. I grieve to see her in this state. She who has beautiful eyes like lotus petals, was protected by the arms of both Rama and Lakshmna, who is tolerant like the earth and is guarded by the female demons of hideous appearance under a tree. \"Deprived of her charm, she resembles a lotuscreeper blasted by frost. This daughter of Janaka has reached a pitiable condition afflicted by series of calamities. She resembles a famale Chakravaka separated from her mate. \"The top branches of Ashoka trees bent down with blossoms and the Moon rising with thousands of cool rays at the end of winter (when spring sets in) beholding which she should be delighted intensfy her sorrow.\" Hanuman, the swiftfooted bull among monkeys, on his part waiting on the Simsupa  tree thus reflecting concluded in his mind that she was Sita.

The Moon shed clear lightas if with his brightness and his cool rays he wished to refresh the son of the Windgod. Then he saw Sita whose face shone like the fullmoon. But she was as though sinking under the burden of sorrow, like a boat with heavy load sinking in water. While Hanuman was eager to observe Sita he saw many shedemons in ugly appearance close by her. One of them was oneeyed, another with a single ear, a third had ears covering the body, yet another had pointed (spikelike) ears, one was breathing through the nose on the head, one had long thin neck, one was hairless another had hair covering like a blanket.

Some were wrathful, some with uneven gaping mouth, and some with smoky hair and distorted faces. They were always found drinking, smeared with flesh and blood and feeding on flesh and blood. Their appearance was horripilating. All of them were seated around the trunk of massive tree. Hanuman, the leader of the monkeys saw there shedemons of several distorted forms. Some were brown in colour and some black and some quarrelsome some holding spears, mallets and hammers of black iron, some with faces like boars, deer, tigers, goats and jackals feet like those of elephants, camels and horses, some had their head sunk into the trunk, others having one hand or one leg likewise some having ears like that of a donkey or a horse or a cow some with elephant ears and some with monkey ears some with big nose, without nose,with crooked nose and some without nostrils breathing through their forehead and some with the trunk of an elephant.

Shorn of lustre, unkempt hair filled with dust, she appeared like a meteor slipped and fallen on land, merits exhausted. She was rich by  her reputation for chastity but poor as she yearned to see her husband. Though devoid of all excellent ornaments, she looked adorned with love for her husband. Besieged by the demon king, deprived of her near and dear ones, Sita was looking like a fettered female elephant separated from its herd and besieged by lions. She appeared like a streak (crescent) of Moon covered by autumnal clouds at the close of the rainy season. She looked haggard since she was out of contact with her husband an unused lute with its strings let loose. She deserves to be with Rama, but had fallen under the sway of shedemons. Sitting in the midst of Ashoka grove she was like a creeper without blossoms. Immersed in the ocean of sorrow the noble lady was like the star Rohini surrounded by unpropitious planets. She deserves to be with Rama, but had fallen under the sway of shedemons. Sitting in the midst of Ashoka grove she was like a creeper without blossoms. Immersed in the ocean of sorrow the noble lady was like the star Rohini surrounded by unpropitious planets. Even though she was daubed with dirt, and had no ornaments on her, she looked bright like a lotus fibre smeared with mud. Hanuman saw the fawneyed lady clad in crushed and soiled clothes with a pathetic face. She felt no dejection when she thought of her husband's prowess. The blackeyed beauty was protected by her own chastity. Hanuman saw the fawneyed lady clad in crushed and soiled clothes with a pathetic face.

She looked like a collective mass of all sorrows, a high tide of suffering. She was a tolerant lady. She had beautiful limbs which looked splendid even though she was not wearing ornaments. Hanuman experienced immeasurable joy on seeing Mythili. Seeing that lady with eyes intoxicating, Hanuman shed tears of joy. At once he paid obeisance to Rama. (thinking he could trace Sita at last). Heroic Hanuman felt happy when he saw Sita. He offered salutations to Rama and Lakshmana at heart and covered himself (with the leaves of the Simsupa tree) and waited.       Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The night came to a close while Hanuman went searching and looking for Sita at Ashoka grove full of flowering trees. At dawn sounds of recitation of Vedas and the six auxillary sciences, (i.e .grammar, prosody, etymology, phonetics, astronomy and the science of rituals) by the brahmins among demons wellversed in performing exalted sacrificial ceremonies were heard. By that time the strongarmed, powerful, tennecked Ravana was awakened by the delightful sounds of auspicious musical instruments. The chivalrous lord of demons woke up as usual.His raiment and garland were still in disarray and he thought of Vaidehi. The demon king who was unable to hide his great passion and control his senses was drawn towards Sita, in his state of intoxication. Adorned with all ornaments and glowing with excellent splendour he went through the path filled with trees flourishing with all kinds of flowers and fruits. Ponds covered with a variety of beautiful flowers and colourful birds always cheerful looked very wonderful. Watching the garden filled with trees, gateways ornamented with gold and gems, he entered through the pleasant pathways in the Ashoka garden. There were wonderful wolves and several herds of animals in the garden. Fruits dropped from trees were strewn all over. Watching the garden filled with trees, gateways ornamented with gold and gems, he entered through the pleasant pathways in the Ashoka garden. There were wonderful wolves and several herds of animals in the garden. Fruits dropped from trees were strewn all over. Ravana, son of sage Paulasti, was followed by a hundred women, just as Indra is trailed by the females of gods and gandharvas. Some women carried golden lamps, some held yalk tail fans in their hands while others bore palmleaf fans. Some moved ahead of him carrying water in golden pitchers. Others followed him carrying circular couches (to be used as seats). One glorious and compassionate lady carried in her right hand a gemstudded jar filled with wine. Another shedemon moved behind him holding an umbrella with a golden handle which was white like a royal swan and bright like the fullmoon. The chief wives of Ravana with eyes dizzy with sleep and drinking followed their heroic husband like streaks of lightning follow a thunder cloud. (Ravana who was dark looked like a cloud and the women with dazzling golden complexion appeared like lightning.) The necklaces and armlets (of the wives) disarrayed, the sandal paste and other unguents on the body smudged, hair hanging down their faces, the sweating damsels followed Ravana. They were dizzy with leftover intoxication and sleep and were swaying from side to side. Their dishevelled hair was loose and faces filled with sweat, their flower garlands on the body had wilted due to sweat on their limbs. The drunken wives of Ravana, actuated by their high regard and passion for him followed as he advanced with drunken eyes.

The drunken wives of Ravana, actuated by their high regard and passion for him followed as he advanced with drunken eyes. Their husband, powerful Ravana under the control of passion looking dull, absorbed in the  thoughts of Sita walked slowly as though counting his steps. Then Hanuman, son of the Windgod, heard their jingling golden girdles and anklets. Then Hanuman, the Vanara saw Ravana of extraordinary deeds, and of unimaginable strength and valour at the entrance (of Ashoka garden) Hanuman saw him in the glow of lamps wet with fragrant oil carried by many shedemons all over. Hanuman saw him, who was possessed of lust, arrogance and intoxication. He appeared like Cupid setting aside his quiver and arrows with his curved, big, red eyes. He was playfully pulling up his upper garment that slipped and stuck to his armlet. This excellent unsoiled robe was looking like the foam of churned nectar. Hanuman seated on a leafy branch (of the simsupa tree) thickly covered with leaves and flowers started scanning the identity of Ravana who was drawing nearer. The leader of the monkeys started gazing at the chief wives of Ravana endowed with youth and beauty Surrounded by beauties, the glorious king entered the grove meant for women, reverberating with the sounds of beasts and birds. The brilliant vanara looked at the son of Visravas (Ravana), the demon king  adorned with wonderful ornaments. He had long tapering ears. He was intoxicated with drink. Encircled by damsels, he was looking like the Moon surrounded by stars. The brilliant vanara looked at the son of Visravas (Ravana), the demon king  adorned with wonderful ornaments. He had long tapering ears. He was intoxicated with drink. Encircled by damsels, he was looking like the Moon surrounded by stars. The brilliant vanara (Hanuman), son of the Windgod recognising the strongarmed Ravana got down a little, saying 'This is truly the strongarmed Ravana.' Hanuman, possessed of extraordinary energy, was taken aback at the might of Ravana. He remained hiding covered over with leaves. With the desire to see Sita endowed with black hair, beautiful hips, plump breasts and dark sideglances, Ravana returned (to Ashokavana).       Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On just seeing Ravana, the lord of demons from a distance, adorned with the best of ornaments the charming, young, blameles princess Vaidehi of beautiful waist trembled like a banana plant shaken by a strong wind. On just seeing Ravana, the lord of demons from a distance, adorned with the best of ornaments the charming, young, blameles princess Vaidehi of beautiful waist trembled like a banana plant shaken by a strong wind. Largeeyed, faircomplexioned Sita seated there with her belly, thighs and breasts covered with arms cried. The tennecked Ravana, too, on his part saw Sita, tormented with grief, guarded by the shedemons like a boat sunk in the sea. She looked woeful seated on the bare earth like the broken branch of a tree cut and fallen down on the ground. Her body looked colourful with dust. Although she deserved adornment, she had none. She was like a lotus stem in mud looking bright yet dull (with mud). She was as though moving towards the knower of the self, the supreme king, Rama with the horses of her resolution yoked to the chariot of her mind. She was emaciated, absorbed in thought of Rama alone and crying and unable to find the end to her grief. Sitting in that manner she resembled a coiled serpent queen, the star Rohini overshadowed by a smoking comet (that is Ravana). Though born in a traditional righteous and virtuous family, she was as though passing through a purificatory process like a lowbred woman. She resembled reputation besmirched by scandals, like Vedic studies  slackened by lack of aplication. (Knowledge is verified with a suitable statment of the Veda which is the ultimate test of ones finding. This method is adopted in all Astika sastras which accept the authority of the Veda). She was like great fame grown dim, faith slighted, worship meddled and hope frustrated. (Note: Sita's condition is being compared with abstract concepts such as fame, faith, reverence and hope which are hit by reverses in fate. She was the personification of all such suffering.) She was like a prospect blasted, command flouted, entire direction set on flames at the time of catastrophe and articles of worship abducted by evil forces at the sacrificial ceremony. She was like a lotuscreeper blighted, an army with its gallant warriors killed, radiance of light blocked by darkness and a stream run dry. (She was) like the altar of worship defiled, blazing fire extinguished, and the Moon eclipsed by Rahu in the full moon night. (She appeared) like a lotuspond the excellent leaves of whose lotuses surrounded by frightened birds are destroyed by the trunks of elephants. Stricken with grief caused by separation from her husband, she appeared like a river gone thin and dry, not fit for ablution, like a night during dark fortnight of the month deprived of all its glow. A delicate lady with beautiful limbs who deserved to be in a gemcrusted house was (now) like a lotus stem just plucked out and  scorched by the Sun's heat. She was sighing heavily in intense grief like a royal female elephant tied to a pillar and separated from her lord, the leader of the herd. She was lovely even with a single braid of unkempt hair like the earth with a single row of dark trees covering its surface at the end of the rainy season. She was wasted and emaciated through fasting and grief, depressed due to brooding and threatenings. She ate very little but was rich with  austerities. Tormented with grief, Sita looked like a goddess begging Rama, the foremost of the Raghu family with folded hands in her mind to destroy Ravana, the tennecked demon. Blameless Mythili with clear, large eyes and beautiful eyelashes with a reddish tint at the corners was looking around, crying. Ravana tried to allure Sita who was deeply faithful to Rama and threatened to kill her (when he found her unflinching).       Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Ravana expressed his intention in sweet words to the depressed and griefstricken ascetic Sita surrounded by demon guards: \"On seeing me, Sita, you want to conceal your thighs, belly and breasts through fear of me. I think you do not want me to see you. \"O largeeyed one  you are endowed with beauty in all limbs. You are the delight of all worlds. I desire you, dear  Oblige me. \"O Sita no human or demon. who can take any form at their will can relieve your fear born of me. \"O timid lady having an unrighteous approach to wives of others or their abduction by force is natural to demons, There is no doubt. \"Mythili  let passion hold its sway over my body as it will. But I shall not force you or touch you since you do not love me. \"O reverend lady, fear not me on that account. Have confidence in me. Show your love. Do not be swayed by grief . \"O Lady, to wear a single braid, sleep on the ground, brooding, wearing soiled clothes and fasting without proper occasion does not suit you. \"O Mythili having secured me, you get all these comforts wonderful garlands, sandal, incense, garments and beautiful ornaments, rich drinks, beds and seats.You can enjoy songs, dances accompanied by musical instruments. \"O Mythili having secured me, you get all these comforts wonderful garlands, sandal, incense, garments and beautiful ornaments, rich drinks, beds and seats.You can enjoy songs, dances accompanied by musical instruments. \"You are a, a jewel among women. You should not  remain like this. You  should adorn yourself properly. How can you remain deprived after having me? \"Your charming youth should not pass away (uselessly). A past event does not come back like a current of stream. \"O lady  with auspicious looks Me thinks, the creator must have retired after creating your beautiful form. For there is no one comparable to you in beauty. \"O Vaidehi you have (extraordinary) beauty  and (exuberant) youth. Who would not lose his balance of mind even if he were Brahma the grandsire himself after getting you? \"O one with a face like the cool fullmoon, with heavy hips. I am unable to extricate my eyes from any limb (of your body) I see. \"O Mythili  be my wife. Give up this (folly due to) delusion. Be my chief consort among the several excellent women I have picked up here and there. Be blessed. \"O timid lady, gems brought forcibly from all the worlds, this kingdom as well as myself are yours. \"O lovely lady I will win all the cities and lands and give them to Janaka for your sake. \"I'm unrivalled in this entire world. Behold my matchless virility which permits no rival in war. \"The gods and demons were unable to withstand my power in wars fought against me. They were often shattered and defeated with their flags crushed in war. \"Offer your love to me. Get yourself decorated in an excellent way. Wear glowing ornaments on your limbs. Let me see you in pleasingly decorated form. \"Offer your love to me. Get yourself decorated in an excellent way. Wear glowing ornaments on your limbs.

Enjoy with me freely and command me boldly. I will obey you by all means. \"O blessed lady, see my affluence and my fame. Seeing you enjoy (life) by my grace all your kinsmen will follow. \"O beautiful lady Rama has renounced victory, he has lost his fortune. Clad in bark, he is wandering in the forest following asceticism and sleeping on the ground. What can he do  for you? I am in doubt if he is alive or not. \"O Vaidehi I wonder if Rama can see you at all. You are like moonlight veiled by dark clouds and  cannot  be seen even by the flying cranes. \"Surely Raghava will not be able to win you back from my hands any more than the demon Hiranyakasipu was able to usurp the fame of Indra. \"O lovely, timid lady your smile, your teeth and your eyes are bewitching. Just as Garuda snatches away a serpent, you ravish my mind by your beauty. \"Even when you are attired in soiled silk and are bereft of ornaments, I find no interest in my own wives. \"O Janaki There are a number of virtuous consorts residing in the harem of my royal palace. You may exercise your authority on all of them. \"O Sita of heavy hips and beautiful brows Be happy. Enjoy all the worlds of mine, the gems and wealth of Ravana. \"O queen Rama is not equal to me  either in penance or prowess or valour or wealth or brilliance or even in fame. \"O delightful one I will bestow you with heaps of riches and land. Therefore, enjoy with me drinking, sporting, and revelling. Accept me and be happy to sport with me.Let your elatives join you and enjoy all my wealth. \"O timid lady embellish yourself with necklaces of pure gold and enjoy with me in the enchanting seaside forest groves full of trees with blossoms and swarming bees.       Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the demon's haughty words, oppressed, pitiable Sita replied slowly in a sorrowful tone. Sita, austere, beautiful and chaste afflicted by grief kept sobbing. Brooding over her husband and trembling in fear, she placed a blade of grass in between her and Ravana and replied with a gentle smile on her face. \"Turn your mind away from me and fix it on your wives. You should not expect to seek me just as a sinner cannot hope to seek blessedness. \"I was born of high lineage and joined a meritorious family by virtue of my marriage. I am devoted only to my husband. I should not commit this contemptible, forbidden act.\" Glorious Vaidehi having thus spoken to the demon turned her back and continued: \"I cannot be your lawful wife obtainable by your personal efforts. I am a chaste woman married to another man. (Being a king) examine the dharma honestly and adopt a pious way of life. \"O nightranger Enjoy your wives. Take care of them. Taking your example, others' wives also deserve to be protected. \"The wives of others will insult an evilminded man who is not satisfied with his own wives, is fickleminded and has no control over his senses. \"Are there no pious men around or are you not heeding their words? Your mind is perverted and inclined to commit a forbidden act. \"You are indulging in unrighteous act and not listening to the advice of wise men who have a sense of discrimination. You are the cause of the destruction of demons. \"Even prosperous countries and cities are destroyed on account of indiscreet rulers engaged in unfair means. \"Having got you as its ruler, this Lanka filled with gems (riches) will perish without delay for the crime of one individual. \"O Ravana living beings will welcome and enjoy the destruction of a shortsighted sinner killed by his own vile act. \"Seeing you, getting ruined this way for your sin, those who were angry with you for their humiliation in your hands will feel glad and say 'Luckily this terrible fellow has met with his doom' . \"I cannot be lured by your power or wealth. I am inseparable from Raghava like light from the Sun. \"How can I pillow on somebody's arm after resting on the honourable arm of the great lord of the worlds ? \"I am alone the lawful wife of the lord of the earth like the knowledge of the Vedas which rightfully belongs to a wise brahmin who has realised the self after having had his ceremonial bath (as a token of celibacy) and having observed strict vows during the period of his study. \"O Ravana it is proper for you to unite me in distress with Rama as one would unite a female elephant with the lordly elephant from which it is separated in the wilderness. \"I wish you to build friendship with Rama, the bull among men. Surely it is the right thing for you to do, if you are desirous of avoiding a dreadful death. \"He is famous as a knower of dharma and is compassionate to those who seek his protection. If you desire to preserve your life build friendship with him. \"Propitiate him. He is compassionate to those who seek refuge. Exercise control over your senses for your sake and it is proper for you to return me to him. \"It is good for you to give me back to Rama, the foremost in the Raghu dynasty. Otherwise you will face death. \"A thunderbolt may spare its target, Yama, lord of death may spare for a long time the life of a person doomed. But Rama, the lord of the world, will not spare any one when enraged. \"You will hear the terrible twang of Rama's bow resembling the rumble of the thunderbolt released by Indra who performed a hundred yajnas. \"Arrows marked with Rama and Lakshmana will soon rain on Lanka like the poisonous snakes with flaming fangs. \"The shafts bound with feathers of Kanka birds (released by Rama and Lakshmana) will be killing the demons all over this Lanka. They will not give a chance for any other weapon to fall. \"Just as Garuda swiftly extirpates the serpents, Rama will exterminate the demon leaders. \"My husband, the subduer of enemies, will soon take me away just as Lord Visnu in the form of Vamana took away the glowing prosperity from the demons with three strides. \"When the army of demons as killed you had no capacity to protect and was destroyed at Janasthana, the place of death. You acted in this dishonest way. \"You are a mean creature. Finding me in the vacant hut, when the two brothers, lions among men, were away, you  abducted me. \"Had you smelt the presence of Rama and Lakshmna, it would not have been possible for you to stand there, like a dog under the gaze of a pair of tigers. \"You will not be able to withstand them in a battle. You will meet the same fate as the onearmed Vritra in a battle with the twoarmed Indra. \"My lord Rama accompanied by Saumitri will draw out your life by his arrows swiftly as Aditya sucks up shallow water at once by his radiance. \"Even if you fly to Kubera's mountain (Kailasa) or the residence of king Varuna (ocean) you will not escape Rama's arrows like a mighty tree cannot evade lightning.       Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the sharp words of pleasing Sita, the lord of demons replied in unpleasant terms: \"The more the lover is courteous and loving and pleasing to women the more he is humiliated by them. \"My love for you has restrained my anger, just as a good charioteer controls the horses galloping on a wrong path. \"Love is partial. It gets bound to those in whomsoever compassion and friendship is generated, even though they are punishable. \"O beautiful one it is on this account that I do not kill you even though you deserve to be killed and insulted (for the words used),  even as you are engaged in a pseudoascetic life. \"O Mythili for each of the piercing statements made you deserve dreadful death.\" Ravana, the lord of demons, said these words in reply to Vaidehi who was overcome with  anger and exitement. \"I shall wait for two months, the deadline fixed. O lady of beautiful hue thereafter you have to share my bed. \"If you are still reluctant to accept me as your husband after two months you will be sent to kitchen to be cooked as morning breakfast for me\". Observing Janaki, threatened by the demon king the daughters of gods and gandharvas shed tears with distressful eyes. When Sita was threatened by the demon king, the daughters of gods and gandharvas there consoled her through gestures of their lips and eyes. Having thus been consoled, Sita, proud of the power of her virtues, said this to Ravana in selfdefence: \"Obviously there is no one among your people keen on your welfare since nobody is preventing you from this reproachable act. \"Who in all the three worlds other than you would, even in mind, seek this consort of the righteous self (Sri Rama) like  Sachi to Indra? . \"O stupid demon where can you go to escape the consequences of your sinful words spoken against Rama's consort of undimmed brilliance? \"It is like a proud elephant fighting in war with a rabbit. Rama is like an elephant and you are like an ordinary rabbit people speak of. \"You are not ashamed of belittling Rama in his absence. You have not yet walked into his sight. \"O ignoble wretch I wonder why your dark brown, distorted eyes do not fall off (the socket) when you look at me (lustfully). \"Why does not your tongue drop down while you speak such words against this consort of the righteous king (Rama) and daughterin law of Dasaratha? \"O Ravana I can reduce you to ashes through the fire of my chastity. But I do not have Rama's permission and I want to preserve my power of ascetism even though you are fit to be consigned to the flames. \"When I was with wise Rama, it was not possible for you to abduct me. No doubt Providence has ordained this to bring about your death. \"You are a (great) warrior and a brother of Kubera. You possess an army. Then why did you abduct Rama's wife bypassing him?\" On hearing Janaki, the lord of demons, Ravana looked at her with his cruel eyes opened wide and rolling. Prosperous Ravana looked like a mass of dark cloud, with strong arms, stout neck, gait of a lion, a blazing tongue and burning eyes He appeared taller with an unsteady crown. He was wearing wonderful red flower garlands and clothes and was smeared with unguents, shining in ornamental armlets. Wrapped well with a big black thread around his hips, he appeared like mount Mandara encompassed by a black serpent at the time of churning the milkocean for nectar. The lord of demons shone like mount Mandara, both his long two arms like two mountain peaks. He stood like a mountain with two Ashoka trees clothed with red leaves and flowers in the form of earrings of the colour of the rising Sun. He was comparable to the wishfulfilling tree grown in heaven, a personified spring season and a memorial structure raised on the cremation ground. He looked frightening even though  welladorned. Looking at Vaidehi, eyes red with anger, and breathing heavily like a histing snake, Ravana replied: \"O Sita you are following a vow of chastity and treading a meaningless, wrong path. I will destroy you as the Sun dispels the morning twilight with his lustre\". King Ravana, a tormentor of enemies, having thus threatened Mythili commanded the shedemons women of fiecrceful appearance as follows: Of them one had one eye, the other one ear, another with ears covered, one had the ear of a cow, another had ears of an elephant and yet another, long, hanging ears. One had the feet of an elephant, another, hoofs of a horse and still another of a cow. While one had a single foot, another had broad feet and yet another no feet at all. One had a long neck and a large head. One had large breasts and belly. One had a big face and eyes, another had a long tongue and yet another no tongue at all. One had no nose and still another had a lion face and yet another the face of a cow.

See that she submits to me at once. \"By adopting means favourable or contrary to her will or through persuasion or coercion or through reward or punishment, draw Vaidehi's mind towards me.\" (said Ravana). The demon king repeatedly commanded the ogresses burning in anger and passion and threatened Sita again and again, pointing his finger at her. An ogress called Dhanyamalini at once approached the tenheaded Ravana and embracing him, said:. \"O king of demons, sport with me, my lord. What purpose will be served with this pale wretched Sita, a human being after all? \"O king surely she is not ordained by Brahma, the foremost among the immortals to enjoy the luxuries earned by the strength of your arms. Having heard her words, the demon king who resembled a fierce dark cloud turned away, laughing heartily. Thereupon the tennecked demon departed, as if he was shaking the earth and entered his residence which was shining like the blazing midday Sun. Then the daughters of gods, gandharvas and nagas gathered round and followed him into his excellent palace. Having derided Mythili trembling in fear yet steadfast in treading the righteous path, Ravana, overpowered with passion left her and entered his glittering mansion.       Thus ends twentysecond sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "King Ravana, tormentor of enemies, having thus spoken to Mythili commanded the demonesses and departed. As the demon king left for his abode all the demonesses of hideous looks rushed towards Sita and crowded around her. The demonesses, overcome with anger, approached Sita and harshly said: 'O Sita don't you think it is a privilege to be the  wife of the highsouled, tennecked Ravana, who is the distinguished king of a high family of sage Paulastya? Then Ekajata, a shedemon of hideous looks, eyes red with anger and a belly of the size of the palm said to Sita: 'The mindborn son of Brahma is well known as Paulastya. He was the fourth  among the six Prajapatis (Maricha, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Plaha, Kratu). 'This glorious mindborn sage Pulastya's son is the famous Vishrava who, in glory and splendour was equal to Prajapatis. 'O largeeyes lady to become the wife of the lord of demons is a stroke of good luck. You deserve to be one. O lady of beautiful limbs why don't you accept his proposal?' Then an ogress called Harijata said this in anger, her cateyes rolling: 'You ought to be the wife of the lord of ogres who has vanquished thirty three crores of gods including Indra, their king.' Then an ogress named Praghasa, overwhelmed with anger, deriding Sita said these terrible words: 'Why don't you wish to be the wife of such a mighty and powerful king, a valiant hero who has never beaten a retreat in war? 'Even renouncing his highly respectable,  favourite wife among all, mighty Ravana is prepared to accept you. 'Ravana is prepared to abandon a thousand wives in his prosperous harem  decorated with all kinds of gems in order to accept you.' Another ogress called Vikata said, ' Know that he who has often defeated gods in war and has vanquished nagas, gandharvas and demons has come to you (seeking your favour)'. Another ogress called Vikata said, ' Know that he who has often defeated gods in war and has vanquished nagas, gandharvas and demons has come to you (seeking your favour)'. 'O foolish woman why don't you seek the wifehood of a glorious king of demons who has abundance of wealth?' Then an ogress called Durmukhi said, 'O lady of long sideglances why don't you yield to him, afraid of whom the Sun scorches not and strong winds blow not? 'O lady of beautiful brows why don't you make up your mind to accept the king of kings, afraid of whom the trees rain flowers, the mountains and clouds release water at his will? Ravana is the king of the southwest, direction Why don't you wish to be his wife?",
                "Then the hideous ogresses approached Sita and spoke these harsh words in an unbecoming manner: 'O Sita why don't you agree to dwell in Ravana's inner apartment furnished with fine bedsteads, and which is delightful? 'You are  a woman, wife of Rama, an ordinary mortal you are holding in high esteem. Withdraw your mind from Rama or else you will not survive. \"Accept Ravana as your husband and after uniting with him enjoy all the pleasures of the three worlds. 'O charming lady you have an irreproachable beauty and grace. Why do you think of human Rama only who has been dethroned from the kingdom. He is only a human being who is unsuccessful and distressful.' Hearing the words of the ogresses, Sita with eyes like lotus petals full of tears replied this way: \"All of you joined together and spoke such words that are not acceptable to the world. Your sinful words of advice do not appeal to me. ' A human being ought not to become wife of a demon. Devour me if you want. I refuse to accept your advice.' 'Dejected or dethroned from the kingdom, Rama is my lawful husband. I will ever remain devoted to Rama as Suvarchala, wife of the Sungod is to him. 'I am steadfast (in love) to my husband Rama, the foremost of the Ikshvaku family in the same manner as noble Sachi to Indra, Arundhati to Vasistha, Rohini to the Moon, Lopamudra to Agastya, Sukanya to sage Chyavana, Savitri to Satyavan, Srimati to Kapilamuni Madayanti to Soudasu, Kesini to king Sagara and Bhima's daughter Damayanti to her lord Nala, (the king of Nishadas)'. 'I am steadfast (in love) to my husband Rama, the foremost of the Ikshvaku family in the same manner as noble Sachi to Indra, Arundhati to Vasistha, Rohini to the Moon, Lopamudra to Agastya, Sukanya to sage Chyavana, Savitri to Satyavan, Srimati to Kapilamuni Madayanti to Soudasu, Kesini to king Sagara and Bhima's daughter Damayanti to her lord Nala, (the king of Nishadas)'. 'I am steadfast (in love) to my husband Rama, the foremost of the Ikshvaku family in the same manner as noble Sachi to Indra, Arundhati to Vasistha, Rohini to the Moon, Lopamudra to Agastya, Sukanya to sage Chyavana, Savitri to Satyavan, Srimati to Kapilamuni Madayanti to Soudasu, Kesini to king Sagara and Bhima's daughter Damayanti to her lord Nala, (the king of Nishadas)'. Hearing the reply of Sita, the ogresses ordered by Ravana and overtaken by anger again began to threaten Sita using harsh words. Hanuman who kept himself concealed on the simsupa tree speechlessly listened to the ogresses threatening Sita. Sita was trembling in fear. The  enraged ogresses went on licking their lips hanging, again and again. The enraged ogresses immediately picked up the axes and rose up saying, 'she is unfit to have the demon king, Ravana as her husband'. As the charming Sita was threatened by the fierce ogresses, she moved towards the simsupa tree with eyes full of tears. Then the largeeyed Sita, drowned in sorrow surrounded by the ogresses went near the simsupa tree and stood there. The ogresses started intimidating Sita who was dressed in soiled clothes and emaciated with a dejected look on her face. Then a dark ogress called Vinata with a terryfying look, loathsome appearance and a large sunken belly said to Sita: 'O Sita you have shown your love for your husband to this extent. It is enough. O auspicious lady anything carried to excess leads to adversity. \"O Mythili I beseech you (to oblige Ravana). You have discharged your duty as a human being. Be happy. But you should also heed my advice which is, after all, salutary. 'Accept as your husband the demon king Ravana, courageous and handsome like Indra, king of the gods generous, sacrificing and pleasing. 'Accept as your husband the demon king Ravana, courageous and handsome like Indra, king of the gods generous, sacrificing and pleasing. 'Leave the helpless human Rama and seek Ravana's refuge. O Vaidehi, using the heavenly unguents and adorned with imposing ornaments from now on, be the queen of all people. O beautiful Sita Just like Swaha, queen to the Firegod and Sachi to Indra, accept Ravana. Why are you still thinking of Rama who is helpless and whose life span is coming to an end soon. 'If you do not heed our words of advice, all of us will eat you at this very moment.' Now Vikata another ogress with hanging breasts raised her fist up in anger and roared at Sita. O wicked Mythili! we have tolerated many unpleasant words uttered by you due to our kindness and mildness.. 'O Mythili you have heeded not our good and timely advice tendered in your interest. You have been brought to the other shore of the ocean and to the inner chambers of Ravana which is very difficult for others to access. 'O Mythili you have heeded not our good and timely advice tendered in your interest. You have been brought to the other shore of the ocean and to the inner chambers of Ravana which is very difficult for others to access. 'You are in Ravana's house, wellguarded by us. It is not possible even for Indra, destroyer of citadels, to come to your rescue (let alone Rama). 'Mythili, act according to our advice. I am your wellwisher. Give up sorrow and stop shedding useless tears. 'O Sita offer your love to Ravana, adore him and be happy. Give up this continuous dejection. Enjoy all pleasures along with the king of demons. 'O timid Sita know that youth of women is fleeting and transient. Before it is over, enjoy all kinds of pleasures. 'O lady of intoxicating eyes range in the company of the demon king, the delightful gardens and mountain ranges filled with gardens. 'O beautiful Sita seven thousand ogresses will be at your beck and call. (Therefore) accept Ravana, the lord of all ogres as your husband. 'O Mythili if you heed not my words of advice, I will pluck out your heart and eat it up'. Next spoke a fiercelooking ogress called Chandodari, overcome with anger taking up a huge trident and rotating. 'I have developed a morbid desire to feast upon this woman with eyes flashing like doe's, whose breasts heave with stress and fear after she was abducted by Ravana. 'I thought of feasting on your spleen, liver, heart, all the joints, head and intestines.' Next spoke an ogress called Praghasa, saying 'Why not we twist and squeeze the neck of this heartless lady. Why are you sitting idle still? Come on.' 'Thereafter we will announce that such a human being is dead. Then Ravana will simply say 'eat her up'. There is no doubt .' Then an ogress called Ajamukhi said, 'Let her body be cut into lumps of equal pieces. 'We shall share them. I do not like disputes in this regard. Go swiftly and get drinks and food to lick. Let the accompanying  dishes of all variety and quality be brought.' Then an ogress called Surpanakha said, 'I too like the proposal of Ajamukhi.' 'Get the wine quickly, destroyer of all sorrows. After relishing the human flesh we will start Nikumbhila dance.' Threatened by the ogresses in that manner, Sita who was like the daughter of a god, cried aloud.       Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the many harsh words of dire threat by the ugly ogresses, the daughter of Janaka wept. In reply to the ogresses who thus spoke, noble Vaidehi, terribly frightened, said in a voice choked with tears. 'A human ought not to become the wife of a demon. You can eat me up. I will not follow your advice.' Surrounded by the ogresses, distressed Sita, who was like the daughter of a divine, did not get any solace. 'Like a doe that strayed from the herd in the forest and tormented by  wolves around, Sita had withdrawn into herself all her limbs through fear, she was trembling excessively. Laying hold on a large blossoming branch of the Ashoka tree, Sita thought of her husband with a broken heart. Her large breasts bathed with the flow of tears, she continued to brood over her plight  and found no end to it. Trembling like a banana tree uprooted by the stormy wind, Sita who was seized with fear of the ogresses looked pale and desperate. The long, luxuriant braid of hair of the trembling Sita waving (in the wind), appeared like a crawling female serpent. The distressed Mythili, her consciousness drowned in grief, sighing, shed streams of tears. 'The bright, beautiful Sita began to wail, alas, \"Rama alas, Lakshmana alas, my motherinlaw, Kausalya alas, Sumitra 'There is a famous popular saying among the learned that untimely death is not possible  either for a woman or a man.It is true that I am living in this miserable condition, deprived of Rama's company and tormented by these cruel ogresses here. Living in such conditions even for a moment is impossible. But nobody dies an untimely death.

Living in such conditions even for a moment is impossible. But nobody dies an untimely death. 'I am a woman of low merit, a wretched woman, an orphan. I will be ruined like the loaded boat that gets hit in the midst of the ocean by the stormy wind. 'Unable to find my husband and seized by these ogresses, I am collapsing on account of grief like a riverbank under the current of water. 'Blessed are those who are in touch with my husband with eyes like lotus petals, whose walk is majestic like a lion's, who has a sense of gratitude and is pleasing in words. 'Separated from Rama endowed with selfknowledge, it is impossible for me to live like one who has drunk venom. 'I do not know what great sin I have committed in my past life for which I experience this terrific, cruel affliction? 'I long to give up my life, afflicted with great grief, as I, wellguarded by these ogresses, have no hope  to reach Rama. 'Fie upon this human life. Fie upon this dependence.

                "The young daughter of king Janaka thus speaking, began to cry, her face bent down. Bewildered or distracted or intoxicated, this young lady wailed, wallowing round on the ground like a young female horse: When Rama was engaged (in deer hunt) and I was screaming, I was brought forcibly by Ravana who can assume any form at his will. \"Having fallen under the clutches of the dreadful demonesses and threatened by them, I am so full of woes and worries that I don't want to live. \"In the absence of the great charioteer Rama, of what use is my living in the midst of ogresses?

He is aware of neither his own self nor his family. \"Even if I am cut, broken to pieces or burnt in glowing fire, I will not accept Ravana. Why do you shout for so long? \"Rama is renowned, wise, grateful and kindly. It is due to my misfortune that he has turned pitiless to me. There is no doubt. \"He who destroyed fourteen thousand demons singlehanded has not come to protect me. I do not know why. \"Rama, my husband, for sure, is capable of killing in battle this Ravana who has held me captive and who is a demon of inferior valour. \"Why is Rama who killed Viradha, a bull among demons, in Dandaka forest in the fight not coming to rescue me? \"This Lanka in the middle of the ocean is unassailable. But there is nothing which can resist the arrows of Rama. \"What may be the reason that my loving husband, Rama who is highly powerful has not reached this place to which I was abducted by the demon. \"The elder brother of Lakshamana does not know that I am here.

                "Hearing Sita's words, some terrifying demonesses, overwhelmed with anger, went to inform Ravana, who was quick to act. The dreadfullooking demonesses once again approached Sita and conveyed her categorically in harsh words the terrible consequences (ahead) \"O vile one you are determined in your evil ways. Today these shedemons will eat away your flesh to their heart's content \". Then seeing the ignoble shedemons threatening Sita, an old demoness called Trijata, who was lying down there, said: \"Devour yourselves now, O ignoble ones, if you will. Do not eat Janaka's favourite daughter, the daughterinlaw of Dasaratha. \"Tonight I had a terrific, horriplating nightmare in which I saw the annihilation of all demons and the triumph of Sita's husband\". Seized with fear, the shedemons, overcome with wrath on hearing Trijata's words said to her. \"O Trijata, tell us the kind of dream you dreamt last night\", they insisted. Hearing the words from the mouth of the shedemons, Trijata told them all about her dream. \"Rama, in white attire, wearing a garland of white flowers, ascending a palanquin made of ivory drawn by a thousand swans and coursing through the sky with Lakshmana arrived. \"Rama, in white attire, wearing a garland of white flowers, ascending a palanquin made of ivory drawn by a thousand swans and coursing through the sky with Lakshmana arrived. \"I also saw Sita in my dream wearing white robes and perched on a white mountain surrounded by the ocean. \"Just as light is united with the Sun, I saw Sita united with Rama.

Sita of delicate limbs approached the Simsupa tree and held on to a branch and stood.

She was in agony, distressed in mind, bereft of all joy (now) standing under that Simsupa tree. Her left eye with a row of curved eyelashes, the black pupils of the eye in white throbbed in an auspicious manner. The lady  with her long tresses, and throbbing eye appeared like a red lotus gently struck by a fish. Her stout left arm curved beautifully, fit for excellent agaru and sandal paste once the pillow by her beloved lord for long, throbbed suddenly. Again her roundshaped left thigh resembling an elephant's trunk started throbbing, presaging union with Rama. Her eyes were pristine, teeth wellshaped. The goldhued auspicious sari on her charming limbs was now a little soiled on account of dust. It slipped slightly as she stood up. This augured well for her. Reassured by such omens which augured well as tested by time, Sita, with beautiful eyebrows, and deep foresight experienced great joy, like a seed blighted by the wind and the Sun comes back to joyful life through a pleasing shower. (A foreteller is addressed as siddha in sanskrit dramas) Her face shining with beautiful red lips like bimba fruit, sparkling teeth, and curved eyelashes with lovely brows extending up to her hair, she appeared like a Moon released from the mouth of Rahu.

I will console her. \"If I should return to Kishkindha without reassuring Sita, whose understanding has been clouded in grief I would be blamed. \"If I so back, this illustrious princess, Janaki will give up her life, finding no means of deliverance (from this tragic situation). \"I should provide some comfort to the strongarmed Rama with a face like the fullmoon yearning to see Sita. \"I cannot talk to her in the presence of these nightroamers. How can I  discharge my duty in this predicament? \"If I do not comfort her before the remaining part of the night ends, she will give up her life. There is no doubt about it. \"If Rama enquires about the message of Sita, this lady of beautiful waist, what can I speak without meeting and talking to her? \"If I leave this place without any message from Sita, Rama will burn me with his eyes full of great anger. \"If I get the lord of vanaras and his army for the cause of Rama (without talking to Sita), their arrival will be useless (if Sita would have given up her life by then). \"I shall wait and speak to her slowly and console this deeply distressed lady when I get a chance to speak to her (when  these ogresses are asleep). I am indeed of small size and that too a monkey. Nevertheless I shall speak in Sanskrit, a language of the common people. (as the she-demons cannot understand that language). \"If I speak like a brahmin in sanskrit language she would be frightened thinking that I am Ravana and how would a vanara speak? \"I will certainly speak to her meaningfully in the language of the people. Otherwise it is not possible to pacify the sinless Sita. \"Since Janaki has already been frightened by the demons, she will be even more terrified seeing me in this form and hearing me speaking this way. By seeing me in this form, sensitive largeeyed Sita will scream loudly thinking that I am Ravana who can assume any form at his free will. \"If Sita screams, the  horde of terrific ogresses will at once gather, armed with dreadful weapons like Yama, the god of death. \"Then all these hideous ogresses will swarm round me and make efforts to capture me with all their strength and kill me. \"Seeing me holding big and small branches of large trees and leaping from one place to the other, the ogresses will get scared. \"These ogresses with their hideous faces will be frightened on looking at my huge form moving in this grove. \"Thereafter the ogresses will draw the attention of demon guards engaged by the king of demons at his residence towards me. \"Those ogresses due to fear will come speedily, armed with spears, tridents, swords and different kinds of weapons for a combat. \"With them around me, I may not be able to  reach the other end of the ocean (my strength spent in the combat.) \"The ogres who are in large numbers, here are very prompt to act. They will jump into the sky and bind me. Sita will not receive the message and I will be taken into custody by the demons. \"These demons who are keen on indulging in violence will harm Janaka's daughter. Then the mission of Rama and Sugriva will also fail. \"Janaki is staying in this untraceable location surrounded by demons. And this location is a secret place surrounded by the ocean . \"If I am killed in the combat or captured by the demons, I do not see another person who can help in accomplishing this task. \"When I am killed here, I cannot see any other vanara who can leap over a hundred yojanas of the ocean (to reach this place). \"I may be capable of killing even thousands of demons but thereafter (thoroughly exhausted) reach the other side of the ocean. \"Battles, no doubt, are unpredictable. Which wise man with a sound intellect will take up a doubtful work unhesitatingly? \"If I talk to Vaidehi it will be a great mistake on my part.If I do not speak to Vaidehi she may give up her life. \"Even well planned diplomatic missions fail like darkness dispelled at Sunrise if the messenger is confused and if the place and time are not propitious for them. \"Swinging from a course of action or an action leading to calamity is not proper. Messengers who assume that they are scholars (blinded by ego) destroy their mission. \"How can the mission succeed? How can failure of mission be avoided? How can the crossing of the great ocean be not wasted?\" Wise Hanuman came to a decision after reflecting in his mind about how not to create fear in Sita (while communicating with her.) \"By praising Rama who is very dear, who is judicious in action and in whom her mind is absorbed, I will not create fear. \"I shall present in auspicious words the esteemed Rama of Ikshvaku family who is a knower of self and make her listen to everything in such a sweet manner that she will trust me. \"I shall present in auspicious words the esteemed Rama of Ikshvaku family who is a knower of self and make her listen to everything in such a sweet manner that she will trust me.

Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After deliberating in several ways the great Hanuman spoke these sweet words to Vaidehi: \"There was an illustrious king called Dasaratha in Ikshvaku race, a master of chariots, elephants and horses. He was highly meritorious and renowned. \"He was the most virtuous among royal sages, equal to sages in austerity, born in the race of emperors and equal to Indra in might. \"He was committed to nonviolence, magnanimous, compassionate and one whose strength was truth. He was not only a prosperous king of Ikshvaku family but also a promoter of prosperity of others too. \"Endowed with signs of kingship and vast wealth, he was a bull among rulers of the vast earth, surrounded by the sea. A happy king himself, he was wellknown as a provider of happiness. \"His beloved eldest son Rama, whose countenance is like the full moon, is a scholar of all branches of knowledge and is foremost among the bowmen on earth. \"The scourage of enemies, he is a protector of righteousness and of his kins and all living creatures. He is an embodiment of righteousness. \"Honouring the word of his aged father who was ever steadfast in truth, Rama left for the forest along with his wife and brother. \"In the deep forest he went round hunting animals and killing the demon warriors who assumed any form at their free will. \"Ravana having heard about the killing of all demons at Janasthana including Khara and Dooshana in the forest, deceived Rama in the guise of a deer and abducted Janaki in anger. \"While looking for the goddesslike lady, the sinless Sita in the forest, Rama met a monkey called Sugriva and made friendship with him \"Rama, a powerful king, who can win enemy forts killed Vali and offered the monkey kingdom to Sugriva. \"Having received Sugriva's orders thousands of monkeys who can assume any form went searching for that divine queen in all directions. \"On hearing the words of Sampati I leaped the wide ocean swiftly crossing a hundred yojanas in quest of the largeeyed Sita. \"Surely I have seen here a lady of similar body, of similar complexion, of similar glow and beauty as described by Rama\". Having spoken thus, the great vanara stopped speaking after that. Janaki was wonderstruck by the words of the vanara. Then Sita looked up at the Simsupa tree timidly, her face covered with beautiful curly hair. On hearing Hanuman's words Sita looked at all directions and quarters while quietly contemplating on Rama, the self of all and experienced supreme joy. She looked obliquely, up, and down and saw Hanuman of unimaginable intelligence, the minister of the monkey lord, son of the Windgod, who looked like the rising Sun.       Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita got perplexed on seeing him (Hanuman), who was tawny in complexion and looked like a cluster of lightnings, clad in white  and hidden in between the branches. There (on the tree) she noticed a monkey like a cluster of fully blossomed Ashoka flower, shining bright, whose eyes were glowing like pure molten gold, speaking softly and pleasingly. Astonisted Mythili began thinking. 'Oh this vanara's appearance is frightening. He is terrible to look at. He is inaccessible'. Thinking over this again and again, she fainted. Overcome with sorrow and fear, noble Sita sobbed pitiably muttering repeatedly. 'O Rama, O Rama, O Lakshmana'. Overcome with sorrow and fear, noble Sita sobbed pitiably muttering repeatedly. 'O Rama, O Rama, O Lakshmana'. Noble Sita, seeing the best of vanaras who stood near humbly, began reflecting 'Is this a dream'? Looking here and there, she saw a monkey with a large, curved face, an obedient servant and a minister of the monkeylord, the foremost among the intelligentia and the son of the Windgod. The largeeyed Sita lost her senses looking at him. She got back her senses after a long time and started thinking again: 'Today I saw an ugly monkey in my dream. Its sight in a dream is inauspicious according to sastras. Let it be auspicious for Lakshmana and Rama for the sake of my father Janaka. \"But no, it was not a dream for tormented by grief and sorrow I cannot have a dream. When separated from the moonfaced Rama I have no sleep or pleasure, how can I have dream? \"I am always meditating upon Rama and thinking of him alone. I am talking about things related to him. Because of that I see him and hear him. \"I am tormented by intense love for Rama, with all my thoughts immersed in him. Since I am constantly thinking of him I see him and hear words about him. (She thinks it is all hallucination.) \"I feel it is only the desire in my mind. Desire has no form. But the one who is addressing me has a form. I cannot understand this. \"My salutations to Indra, Brihaspati, Brahma the creator and also to the firegod. Let all those words spoken by the vanara here in front of me be true and not other than that.\"       Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman, son of the Windgod whose face shone like coral, dressed in a sober manner climbed down the tree, went close to Sita, offered salutations with his palms on his head and spoke in sweet words: Hanuman, son of the Windgod whose face shone like coral, dressed in a sober manner climbed down the tree, went close to Sita, offered salutations with his palms on his head and spoke in sweet words: \"O blameless lady with eyes like lotus petals, in crumpled silk, holding a branch, and standing, who are you? \"Why are tears of grief flowing from your eyes like water trickling down a pair of petals of white lotuses? \"O noble lady, are you a goddess or a demoness, a naga, a gandharva, a rakshasa, a yaksha or a kinnera? \"O beautiful lady Do you belong to the race of Rudras, or Marutas, or Vasus?. O noble lady, you appear a goddess to me. \"are you Rohini, embellished with best virtues among the constellations? Have you come down from the abode of the luminaries separated from the Moon, her lord? \"O lady of lovely black eyes who are you? Have you by any chance offended your husband out of anger or out of delusion? Are you the auspicious Arundhati dislodged for making your lord Vasistha angry? \"O woman of beautiful waist from which world have you come here? For whom are you worrying? Who is your son, father, brother or husband? Are you worrying about some one dead?. \"From your weeping, your sighing and your touching the earth (gods do not touch the earth) and your signs of sovereignty, I do not think you are a goddess (meaning otherwise she posessed divine grace). \"On the basis of your royal signs and other qualities I infer that you are the daughter of a king or his consort. \"If you are Sita, who was forcefully borne away by Ravana from Janasthana you may kindly reveal to me freely. May god bless you. \"Indeed your plight, the superhuman beauty and your robes marked with asceticism, surely tell me that you are Rama's queen.\" Happy to have heard words of praise of Rama, Vaidehi spoke this to Hanuman, who got up the tree: \"I am daughterinlaw of king Dasaratha, knower of the self, the foremost among kings on earth and a slayer of enemy army. \"I am daughter of the great soul, Janaka, king of Videha, known as Sita. I am the wife of that sagacious Rama. \"I enjoyed worldly pleasures in abundance for twelve years at Rama's abode. \"Then in the thirteenth year king Dasaratha along with the royal preceptor arranged to  coronate Rama, delight of the Ikshvaku family, in the kingdom. \"While preparations for the coronation were on, queen Kaikeyi said to her husband: 'I shall not drink or eat food, if Rama is coronated. I shall end my life this moment. 'O Dasaratha, the foremost among kings if the promise lovingly made by you earlier is not going to be false, Rama should go to the forest'. \"Remembering the boons the ever truthful king had granted to Kaikeyi, he fainted after hearing her cruel and harsh words. \"The aged king who held on to truthfulness and righteousness begged his famed eldest son Rama to return the kingdom. \"The illustrious Rama who valued his father's word more than sovereignty, bowed to the command of the father. \"Rama, whose strength was his truthfulness, gave whatever others sought but would not accept anything in return. He would not speak a harsh word. \"Having given up the kingdom  voluntarily, Rama, a highly renowned king cast off his luxurious upper garments and asked me to take care of his mother. \"I, however resolved to live in the forest, marched ahead of him quickly as I did not prefer even heaven without him. \"Respecting the king's order and determined firmly, we entered the impenetrable forest. \"While the most valiant Rama was living in the Dandaka forest, I, his wife was borne away by the evilminded Ravana. \"He has allowed me two months time to live. After two months I will have to give up my life.\"       Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the words of Sita who was overwhelmed with grief, the monkey leader Hanuman felt sad and thus spoke comforting her: \"By the command of Rama I am here as a messenger. He is keeping well. He is well and wishes you well. \"O godlike lady Rama, son of Dasaratha, master of the Vedas, wielder of Brahmastra wishes you well. \"The mighty Lakshmana too, a dear brother and follower of your husband is immersed in grief, and sends salutations to you.\" On hearing the wellbeing of Rama and Lakshman, lions among men, Sita experienced thrill all over her body. She then  spoke to Hanuman: \"The adage that 'joy comes to a living being even though it be at the end of  a hundred years' is popular. It appears true in my case\". Hanuman thus created a sense of wonderful joy in her as they came together. Both of them started to converse restoring confidence in each other. Hearing the reply of Sita, who was crying piteously, stricken with grief, the monkey leader, Hanuman moved close to her. As Hanuman started slowly drawing close, Sita suspected he might be Ravana. \"Ohshame on me. I have told him my story which should not have been said. This is verily Ravana come in a disguise\". So saying Sita of flawless limbs, emaciated with grief, left the branch of Ashoka tree held by her and squatted on the ground. The longarmed Hanuman saw Sita, who was stricken with grief and deluded with fear. He prostrated to her. But out of fear she did not look at him. On seeing the vanara prostrated, the moonfaced lady, sighed deeply and spoke to him in a sweet voice: \"If you are that trickster Ravana who appears incognito before me, it is not good for you. You are causing grief again. \"You are the same Ravana who took the guise of a mendicant, giving up your real form and came to Janasthana. \"Oh you are one who can assume any form at will. You are a nightstalker. It is not good for you to cause pain to me who is already emaciated through fasting, who is pitiable and who is already afflicted. \"May be my suspicion is not correct Because I am experiencing pleasure in my mind in your presence. \"O great vanara, If on the other hand you have come here as Rama's messenger I wish you well. I love Rama's story. Tell me. \"O vanara Rama's virtues are dear to me to hear. O gentle one just as the current of the river wears away its banks, my mind is lured by your presence. \"Oh I have been seeing the person sent by Rama in my dream for a long time. This is a pleasant dream to me. \"Even if I can see the heroic Rama together with Lakshmana in my dream my pain will be gone. Even the dream is inimical to me (I cannot sleep and thus cannot dream.) \"I do not think it is a dream. Pleasure cannot be experienced by seeing a vanara in a dream. I experience pleasure now (seeing a monkey in a dream is a bad omen). \"Can this be a delusion of my mind or a mental imbalance (resulting in movement of the mind in the body). Is it a malady born of  my madness? Or is it a mirage? \"No, this cannot be insanity. nor even delusion. But I recognise this vanara well\" Considering the strength and weakness of demons in that manner Sita thought that Hanuman was none other than the king of demons who can asume any form at will. Having entertained such thoughts, Sita, the lady with a fairwaist, daughter of Janaka,  did not respond to the vanara. Hanuman, son of the Windgod understood what was going on in Sita's mind and spoke pleasing words that brought joy in her. \"Rama is glorious as the Sun, brings delight to the whole world like the Moon, is the king of kings like Vaisravana,  and renowned like Visnu endowed with valour. \"Rama is glorious as the Sun, brings delight to the whole world like the Moon, is the king of kings like Vaisravana,  and renowned like Visnu endowed with valour. \"He is truthful in speech like Brihaspati, prosperous (like Kubera), sweettongued, handsome, graceful like Kamadeva. \"He shows anger to one who deserves it, he is the foremost charioteer of the world and he is a great self under the shadow of whose shoulders the whole world takes refuge. \"You will see the consequences of the action of Ravana who abducted you deceitfully in the form of deer when Rama was away from the hermitage. \"Heroic Rama will soon release many scorching, fiery arrows in anger and kill Ravana. I seek your permission as an envoy of Rama. Filled with grief by your separation, he has made inquiries about your welfare. \"Heroic Rama will soon release many scorching, fiery arrows in anger and kill Ravana. I seek your permission as an envoy of Rama. Filled with grief by your separation, he has made inquiries about your welfare. \"The brilliant, longarmed Lakshmana, delight of Sumitra enquires about your welfare and offers salutations to you. \"O goddess like lady Rama's friend Sugriva, king of vanara chieftans inquires about your wellbeing. \"O Vaidehi Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva always remember you. Luckily you are alive even though you are under the clutches of shedemons. \"Very soon you will see mighty Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva of unlimited prowess surrounded by crores of vanaras. \"I am Sugriva's minister known as Hanuman, a vanara who entered the city of Lanka after leaping over the great ocean. \"Setting my foot with my valour on the head of the cruelminded Ravana, using my valour,  I came here to see you. \"O goddesslike lady I am not  a deceitful person as you suppose me to be. Shake off your suspicion as I speak to you and trust me.\"       Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing about Rama from the bull among vanaras, thus spoke Vaidehi politely in a sweet voice: \"Where did you come in contact with Rama? How did you assess Lakshmana? How did an alliance of vanaras and humans take place? \"O vanara tell me all about the identification marks of Rama and Lakshmana again so that grief does not enter my mind. \"What does Rama look like? And Laksmana? How are his thighs, arms? Tell me\". Questioned thus by Vaidehi, Hanuman, son of the Windgod started describing Rama's physique as it is. \"O Vaidehi with eyes like lotus petals although you know your husband's and Lakshmana's form and distinguishing marks, it is my good fortune that you asked me (to describe them). \"O largeeyed lady I will describe those distinguishing marks of Rama and Lakshmana Listen. \"O daughter of Janaka Rama with eyes like lotus petals is a person born with a delightful form, richly endowed with indescribable charm and politeness. \"He vies with the Sun in effulgence, with earth in forbearance, with Brihaspati in intelligence, and in fame with Indra. \"Rama is a protector of the entire world of living beings not to speak of his own people.

Her beautiful countenance with large white eyes with a reddish tinge in the corners shone like the Moon released from Rahu. Young Sita felt delighted about her husband's news and blushed. By praising him for his action, she pleased the great monkey. \"O foremost among the vanaras you have trespassed the abodes of demons all alone. You are mighty and capable and wise. \"You with your admirable prowess have reduced this ocean which is an abode of crocodiles stretching over a hundred yojanas to a cow's hoof mark. \"I do not think you are an ordinary monkey.

Hopefully, Rama is well honoured  by his allies. \"Does the prince ever seek the blessings of gods or fall back upon personal effort as well as providence? \"I hope Rama is not devoid of love towards me by  my separation. O Vanara, hope he will liberate me from this misery. \"I hope Rama who deserves happiness and not suffering has not become depressed now , having experienced a spate of sorrows. \"I hope he regularly receives news about the welfare of Kausalya, Sumitra and Bharata. \"I hope respectable Rama is not too absentminded for being immersed in sorrow on my account. Hope he will save me. \"Will Bharata, the devoted brother, send his formidable army of one akshavhini protected by ministers for my cause? I trust he will. (Akshauhini  109350 foot soldiers  65610 horse soldiers  21860 elephants soldiers on chariot) \"I trust that the illustrious Sugriva surrounded  by valiant vanaras who use their teeth and nails as weapons will reach this place. \"Hope heroic Lakshmana, enhancer of the joy of Sumitra, who has mastered the use of weapons will blow away the demons through a network of arrows. \"Can I hope to see Ravana and his relatives slain in the battle by fiery weapons in a short time? \"Hope, Rama's moonlike face without me with its golden complexion and lotus fragrance must not have been pale and withered with tears like the lotus in a pond scorched by the heat. \"Rama has given up sovereignty for the sake of establishing righteousness and led me into the forest on foot.He had not then felt any fear, anxiety or grief at heart.Rama showed patience, instead. Hope he retains them. \"His love for me is superior to his love for his father, mother or any one else. O messenger, I wish to survive till I hear any  news from my dear lord.\" The godlike lady, having spoken to the vanara leader in a very meaningful and sweet manner about her beloved Rama, she remained silent, waiting to hear Hanuman's attractive words of description of Rama once again. Having heard Sita, Hanuman endowed with fearsome power placed his folded hands on his head and said this: \"O lotuseyed one Rama knows not that you are here. Therefore he has not taken you away immediately as did Indra to rescue his wife Sachi. \"As soon as he hears your words from me, Rama will reach (here), leading a huge army of powerful troops of vanaras and bears. \"Kakutstha Rama will still the imperturbable abode of Varuna (ocean) by the torrent of his arrows and rid the city of Lanka of all the demons. \"Thereafter, whoever comes Rama's way,  be it  gods or demons or even death or any one else he will destroy them. \"O noble lady not being able to see you, Rama is immersed in an ocean of sorrow, he has no solace like an elephant tormented by a lion. \"O Sita I swear in the name of mountains like Malaya, Vindhya, Meru, and Dardura (the abodes of monkeys and bears) and  by the roots and fruits as well (which are the food of vanaras). you will soon behold Rama with beautiful eyes, red lips like bimba fruit, lovely earrings and a countenance resembling the full moon. \"O Sita I swear in the name of mountains like Malaya, Vindhya, Meru, and Dardura (the abodes of monkeys and bears) and  by the roots and fruits as well (which are the food of vanaras). you will soon behold Rama with beautiful eyes, red lips like bimba fruit, lovely earrings and a countenance resembling the full moon. \"O Vaidehi, you will soon see Rama seated on the Prasravana mountain just as Indra (who performed a hundred sacrifices) seated on the back of the king of elephants. \"Rama is not eating meat, nor drinking wine. He takes only the one fifth of a meal (sanctioned for an ascetic) available in the forest. \"Since you left, Rama has been always thinking sincerely of you, no longer drives away flies or mosquitoes nor insects or serpents from his body (his mind entirely fixed on you). \"Rama is always lost in thought. He is totally given to grief. Absorbed in love for you, he thinks of none else \"Rama, the best of men never goes to sleep and even if he drops off to sleep he mutters 'Sita, Sita' in a sweet voice in his sleep. \"Sighing deeply whenever Rama sees a fruit or a flower or any such delightful thing, he remembers you and calls you out again and again, saying, 'alas, my darling ' \"O divine lady prince Rama is ceaselessly suffering. He keeps talking to you in air. The determined Rama is only thinking of your recovery \". Her sorrow was mitigated by references made by Hanuman about Rama.She felt equally sad when she heard about Rama's agony. The princess from Videha appeared like a night at the advent of autumn, with the Moon looking partly muffled by clouds and partly bright.       Thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "To the righteous words (about Rama's grief) of Hanuman, Sita with a face like the full moon replied. \"O vanara you have told me that Rama has his mind always fixed on me, not on others and you have also said that he is sad. It is like offering me poison mixed with nectar. \"Death snatches a man tied with a cord, whether he is rolling in luxury or sinking in adversity. \"O best of vanaras surely it is not possible for living beings to overcome destiny. You see how Sri Rama, Saumitri, and my own self are all   afflicted with grief. \"When will Raghava reach the shore of this ocean of grief? He is like a man who has suffered a ship wreck, trying to swim? \"When will my husband see me after killing the demons including Ravana and uprooting Lanka? \"One year's time has been given (by Ravana) to me.  Rama should be informed to be quick in reaching before the completion of the time limit and that I will survive till then only. \"O vanara this is the end of the tenth month. Only two more months are left. This is the condition laid by the wicked Ravana in my case. \"Vibhisana made efforts to advise Ravana for my restoration. But Ravana has not agreed to that. \"Ravana did not like to return me having fallen into the death trap. Death lies in wait for him in battle. \"O vanara Nala the eldest daughter of Vibhisana sent by her mother came here personally and reported this to me. \"O eminent vanara no doubt my lord will soon reach this place. My pure conscience tells me that Rama has many virtues. \"O vanara Rama is endowed with perseverance, manliness, prowess, kindness, gratitude, competence and power. \"At Janasthana without the help of his brother also he slew fourteen thousand demons. Which enemy will not tremble before him? \"O bull among men he will not be shaken by calamities. Just as Sachi, the daughter of Puloma knows Indra's might I know Rama's. \"O monkey the valiant Rama is like the Sungod shoofing a dazzling volley of arrows which will dry up the sea of enemy forces.\" While Sita, tormented with grief on account of Rama was thus speaking, her eyes filled with tears, the monkey said: \"On hearing me Rama will reach soon with a huge army of vanaras and bears. \"O beautiful lady, if you please, I shall redeem you today itself from grief. You may ride on my back, O blameless lady. \"Placing you on my back I shall cross the ocean. Indeed, I have the capacity to carry the entire city of Lanka along with Ravana. \"O Mythili Just as oblations offered to the sacred fire goes to Indra, I shall offer you today to Rama waiting on the Prasravana mountain. \"O Vaidehi you will see Rama and Lakshmana making all out efforts like Lord Visnu to kill the demons. Mighty Rama staying in asram ill be enthused to see you seated on my back like Lord Purandara (Indra) seated on the back of the lord of elephants (Airavata) \"O god like lady climb up my back. Do not be reluctant. Join Rama just as Rohini unites with the Moon, O beautiful one \"Climb on my back and cross the ocean through space in the flaming light, conversing with Moon and Sun. \"O beautiful lady it is not possible for all the inhabitants of Lanka together to follow me while I carry you from this place. \"O Vaidehi just as I reached here I shall beyond doubt take you on my back in the same way across the sky without any difficulty. See. When Mythili heard the wonderful proposal from Hanuman, the best of vanaras, she experienced immense joy in every limb of her body and said: \"Hanuman how do you intend to carry me to such a distant place? Indeed, it is your monkey nature, I suppose. \"O bull among monkeys you have  such a small body. How can you intend to carry me from here to my husband, the lord of men\"? On hearing Sita's new belittling statement about him, Hanuman, the illustrious son of the Windgod reflected: 'Blackeyed Sita is not aware of my strength or my power. Therefore let her see the real (huge) form that I can assume at my free will'. Thinking thus, Hanuman, the noble monkey, crusher of enemies, started revealing his real form to Vaidehi. The wise bull among monkeys, jumped down from the tree and started growing in size in order to instil confidence in Sita. Hanuman, the foremost of the vanaras resembling mount Meru or Mandara stood there glowing like blazing fire in front of Sita. Resembling a mountain in size, with a red face, with teeth and nails strong like  diamond, the vanara in dreadful form said to Vaidehi: \"I have the capacity to carry away this entire Lanka uprooted with its mountains, gardens, forts, ramparts and gateways along with the king. \"O queen it is enough. Give up this unworthy attitude. Be stable. O Vaidehi, rid Lakshmana and Rama of grief\". Seeing the son of Maruta in dreadful form, the broad lotus petaleyed daughter of Janaka with eyes as large as lotus petals replied : \"O great monkey I have understood your strength and power. Your speed is like the Windgod's and your power is astonishing and splendid. \"O chief of vanaras how could an ordinary person be capable of reaching this land on far off shore of the immeasurable ocean? \"I know you are capable of carrying me on your journey. I am sure about the quick success of your mission which has been carried out after careful planning. \"O sinless and foremost monkey going with you is not proper for me. Your windlike speed will render me unconscious. \"When you fly over the ocean in the sky  speedily I may tumble down from your back by your speed out of fear. \"O destroyer of foes, it is not possible for me to go with you. Further, when you are burdened with a woman you will also fall into danger (because of me), no doubt. \"When I am seen (while being carried away) by the demons of fearsome valour they will pursue you, ordered by the wicked Ravana. \"O heroic monkey as the warriors armed with spears and maces surround you and attack, your life will be in danger, because of me. \"The demons are in large number and they will be armed with weapons. You are unarmed. How can you fight and protect me? \"O noble monkey while you are engaged in fighting with those demons of wicked deeds, I may drop down out of fear. \"O noble monkey the massive, fearsome and powerful demons may defeat you in the fight in any way. \"Or else, while you are engaged in fighting and turn your attention the other way I might fall down and the sinful ogres may bear me away. \"They may snatch me away from your hands or cut me to pieces. Success or defeat is uncertain in a war. \"In such a case, caught and intimidated by the demons I may die. Then your efforts will be wasted. \"It may be that you can kill  all the demons but by such an act the fame of Rama will be diminished. (He cannot give his strength a trial) \"Or else, the ogres will carry me  and conceal me in a secret place which the vanaras or Rama and Lakshmana may not know. \"All your effort for my sake would be futile. Hence Rama's arrival along with you will be of great benefit. \"O strongarmed Hanuman your life and the life of the great self Rama, of his brother, and relatives of your king is dependent upon my survival. \"Both Rama and Lakshmana who are emaciated with sorrow and suffering on account of me will give up their lives along with vanaras and bears. \"O chief of vanaras I cherish my devotion towards Rama alone and not touch the body of any other man. \"I had no control over myself. I was helpless and my husband was not present when I had to bear the touch of Ravana's limbs. What can I do? \"It will be proper if Rama comes here, kills Ravana along with all his relations and takes me away. \"I have seen and heard about Rama's conquest of enemies and his valiant deeds in war. Indeed, gods gandharvas, nagas or even demons cannot match him in war. \"After seeing Rama who is equal to lord Indra in valour. He is like blazing fire whipped by wind, wielding a wonderful bow, who can withstand the power of strong Rama accompanied by Lakshmana in war? \"O chief of vanaras who can withstand Rama accompanied by Lakshmana, the conqueror of enemies? His arrows resemble the rays of the Sun at the time of the deluge, steady like the elephants who support the quarters of the earth.",
                "Satisfied with the words of Sita, the tiger among monkeys, who was eloquent in speech said: \"O queen O lady of auspicious appearance your words are most appropriate to and characteristic of a modest virtuous woman. \"It may not be possible for a woman to cross on my back the vast ocean stretching over a hundred yojanas. It is not possible for a woman. \"O humble lady the second reason given by you, 'I ought not to touch a person other than Rama' is well said and worthy of you, being the wife of the great soul. Who else can speak such words? \"O humble lady the second reason given by you, 'I ought not to touch a person other than Rama' is well said and worthy of you, being the wife of the great soul. Who else can speak such words? \"O queen Kakutstha Rama will hear from me fully all that has been said and done by you in my presence without any omission. \"O queen my heart is drenched with love for Rama and desires to please him for many reasons. Therefore these words have been spoken by me. \"Crossing the ocean and entering Lanka are  difficult. But I accomplished it. Hence my proposal. \"I offered to take you today itself out of my love and devotion to Rama with a desire to unite you with him and not with any other intention. \"O blameless lady If you wish not to accompany me you may give me a token of identification to let Rama know about my coming here and seeing you\". Having heard Hanuman, Sita, a child of god, said these words in a low tone. Choked with tears, 'Carry this token of identity to my dear husband': 'Long ago we were staying at Siddhasrama. This hermitage was situated to the northeast at the foot of Chitrakuta mountain which was not far from the river Mandakini. It had abundant roots, fruits and water. You sported with me in the gardens which were fragrant with many types of flowers and ponds. You sat down on my lap with wet clothes in the hermitage'. 'Long ago we were staying at Siddhasrama.

'Then a crow greedy of flesh began to peck my bossom with its beak. I took a clod of earth and warded him off. 'The crow was an eater of offerings, hungry for food began to peck me again and again for flesh.He did not stop. 'My upper cloth was slipping. I was trying to pull up my waist string angrily when you saw me. 'Then you made fun of me, and I became angry. I was abashed. Torn by the voracious bird I sought your shelter. 'Exhausted, I sat on your lap again. Seeing my angry face you pacified me. You were happy (to see me draw close). 'O lord when I was angered by the crow and my face was filled with tears, you marked me wiping my eyes. 'Totally exhausted I slept on your lap for a long time, and in turn you slept on my lap later. 'The crow came back again and clawed me in the space between my breasts even after I woke up after slumber from Rama's lap. Flying, it tore my bosom again and again. 'The crow came back again and clawed me in the space between my breasts even after I woke up after slumber from Rama's lap. Flying, it tore my bosom again and again. 'At the touch of the drops of blood dripping from my body, tormented by seeing me distressed with the dripping blood, you were awakened, you who were an illustrious scorcher of foes. 'O strongarmed Rama, seeing my torn breasts, you became angry like a hissing serpent  and hissing said : 'O Sita with a beautiful lap like an elephant trunk by whom is your bosom wounded? Who is sporting with an angry fivehooded snake? 'Then looking around, you saw the crow facing me with sharp, bloodstained claws. 'This crow was the best of birds. He was surely Indra's son who had covered a long distance with great speed and his speed was like the Windgod's. 'Then you, the strongarmed and best among the wise, your eyeballs rolling in fury, made up your mind about the cruel crow. 'Taking out a blade of darbha grass from your mat, you invoked the weapon of Brahma by reciting the mantra. Then you discharged it which blazed like the fire of death and went spearheading towards the crow. 'Then you threw the burning darbha grass at the crow and it chased him in the sky. 'Then that crow flew to many places seeking asylum all over the universe chased by the blade of grass. 'Then the crow went round all the three worlds, having been rejected by his father Indra, including all the sages and gods. Refused by all he came back to Rama seeking shelter. 'Seeing the crow fallen on the ground, O Kakutstha, you who are a saviour of those who seek refuge saved him out of compassion, even though he deserved to be killed. 'Rama, you saw the crow in pain and despondency who returned to you and said that it is not possible to make Brahma's weapon ineffectual.You may tell now. (what should be done.) 'Then that crow said, 'let my right eye be blinded'. you then hit the right eye of the crow'. Thus the crow offered his right eye and saved himself. 'Then that crow said, 'let my right eye be blinded'. you then hit the right eye of the crow'. Thus the crow offered his right eye and saved himself. 'That crow offered salutations to you Rama and king Dasaratha, thereafter took permission and went to his own dwelling. '(Addressing Rama as though he was present before her, Sita said) 'O lord of the earth for my sake you released the weapon of Brahma on a crow. What makes you excuse him who has abducted me? 'O bull among men you are so loving to me. I am like an orphan. Be kind to me. She who has found her lord in you stays without a protector. 'O my supreme lord I know you are kind, righteous, valiant, vigroous, mighty. You are boundless, calm and deep like the ocean. You are lord of earth and the seas and compeer of Vasava. I have heard from you that motiveless compassion is the best way to make one righteous. 'O my supreme lord I know you are kind, righteous, valiant, vigroous, mighty. You are boundless, calm and deep like the ocean. You are lord of earth and the seas and compeer of Vasava. I have heard from you that motiveless compassion is the best way to make one righteous. 'Even though you are an expert in the use of weapons, truthful and strong. (Yet) why are you not using weapons aganst the demons?' (Now Sita turns to Hanuman and says) \"In war serpents, gandharvas, demons or Marutas cannot withstand the speed of Rama's arrows and hit back. \"Does Rama have a little anxiety about me? If he has, why does he, a disciplined hero, not  put an end to the demons with his sharp arrows? \"Or, why does the mighty hero, Lakshmana, who is a scorcher of enemies, not come to my rescue taking the orders from his brother? \"Both Rama and Lakshmana are tigers among men who resemble wind and fire in power and have the unassailability of the gods. Wherefore are they disregarding me?. \"Perhaps I must have committed an atrocious sin. There is no doubt. For although both of them are scorchers of enemies, they deliver me not.\" Hearing the piteous words of Vaidehi and beholding her eyes filled with tears, the Windgod's son, lustrous Hanuman replied thus:. \"O godlike lady Rama is not averse to your misery. On my word this is true. Rama is immersed in sorrow. Even Lakshmana wails. \"I could find you with difficulty. This is not the time to wail. O blameless lady take it, your sorrow has come to an end at this moment. \"Both the mighty brothers, tigers among men, are eager to see you. Both the princes will reduce this Lanka  into ashes. \"O largeeyed lady cruel Ravana along with his relatives will be killed by Rama in war and Rama will return to his city with you. \"Communicate your message to mighty Rama and Lakshamana, to brilliant Sugriva and even the vanaras who gather there. \"Hanuman having spoken this way, Sita, resembling a god's daughter, grieving, thus addressed Hanuman: \"Bow to Rama and offer salutations on my behalf. Inquiries concerning his welfare should be addressed to Rama, whom virtuous Kausalya bore as a son. \"Great, righteous Lakshmana had given up his pleasures and followed his brother Rama in his favour into the forest to be able to serve him. \"Lakshmana, who has lionshoulders and strong arms, who is handsome, who takes Rama as his father and treats me as his own mother. \"Heroic Lakshmana, did not know while I was borne away. He is prosperous, foremost in serving elders. He is energetic and reserved in his speech like my fatherinlaw. He is a prince dear (to his brother). \"Rama's brother Lakshmana is always dear to me. Heroic Lakshmana will discharge whichever responsibility is entrusted to him. \"He is Lakshmana for whose care and support Rama did not miss the noble king Dasaratha (during exile). Convey him my words of enquiry about his wellbeing. \"Lakshmana is soft, pure, competent and dear to Rama. O great vanara, act in such a manner that Lakshmana can mitigate my suffering. O great monkey, the best of vanaras you are competent in accomplishing this task. \"Lakshmana is soft, pure, competent and dear to Rama. O great vanara, act in such a manner that Lakshmana can mitigate my suffering. O great monkey, the best of vanaras you are competent in accomplishing this task. \"By your efforts alone my husband will try for my release. You may tell these words to my heroic husband, Rama, again and again. \"I will hold on to life  only for a month. Beyond, I will not survive. I swear by truth. You may tell this to Rama. \"O heroic Rama just as Kausik was rescued from the underworld it behoves you to deliver me from imprisonment of wicked Ravana\". Then Sita took out the exquisite and auspicious Chudamani worn on the head, untied from her clothes and gave it to Hanuman to be presented to Rama. Then Hanuman, taking the extraordinary jewel and placed it on his finger as it was not fitting to his arm. Having recieved the jewel from Sita and circumambulated her, Hanuman offered salutations to  her and stood by her. Hanuman stood there physically, with great joy gazing at Sita, but mentally he was with Rama. Having received the most precious jewel from the daughter of Janaka, Hanuman prepared to return like a mountain released from the impact of the wind.       Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita gave the jewel to Hanuman and said, \"This signet ornament is known to Rama very well\". \"Seeing this jewel,Rama will recall three of us, my mother, myself and the king Dasaratha\" (as this was given by her mother at her marriage.) \"Great Hanuman you are enthused now. You may think over the future course of action. \"O best of monkeys it is your  responsibility to carry out this task. O Hanuman think carefully of that. Take the initiative to reduce my suffering. I am confident that you can do it.\" Hanuman possessed with fierce valour said to Vaidehi, 'so be it' and bowed his head, and offered salutations before he departed. The noble lady, Sita, having been fully convinced about Hanuman and realising that he is about to start, her voice was choked with tears. She said these words: \"O Hanuman the great communicate my welfare  to both Rama and Lakshmana, to Sugriva, his ministers, elderly vanaras in righteous order. \"O Hanuman the great communicate my welfare  to both Rama and Lakshmana, to Sugriva, his ministers, elderly vanaras in righteous order. \"You must pacify the strongarmed Rama in a manner by which he will help me to cross the ocean of grief and rlieve me. \"Let the illustrious Rama take me alive. Help me with your (persuasive) words and you will acquire merit. \"On hearing your ever spirited words his manliness to get me back will be charged. \"Having heard Sita's words, Hanuman, son of Maruta, placed his folded palms over his head in reverence and replied: \"Kakutstha Rama, accompanied by vanaras and bears will reach here soon and conquer the enemies in war and relieve your grief. \"I do not see any one among humans or demons or even among gods who can face his arrows when released. \"Indeed, Rama is capable of conquering even the Sungod, or the raingod or Yama (the son of the Sun) specially for your sake. \"Rama is fit to rule the entire earth surrounded by the ocean. O delight of Janaka he will succeed in serving your cause.\" On hearing the truthful, proper, pleasing words by Hanuman whom she held in great esteem, Sita said this: Sita again and again looked at Hanuman who was about to start. She made him understand her words conveying her love for Rama. \"O destroyer of enemies if you think of halting for a day you may do so in a solitary location and leave tomorrow. \"Your presence will relieve me of my suffering, if you stay here for a while. \"O tiger among vanaras if you leave this place to come again, my life will be uncertain, (if your coming is uncertain). There is no doubt about it. \"My agony would be increased further by not seeing you. It would be inflamming my agony and I would be even more pained. \"O heroic chief of vanaras I am doubtful as to whether vanaras and bears can extend help? \"How can the army of vanaras and bears, for that matter, princes Rama and Lakshmana negotiate the ocean, which is difficult to cross? \"It is only three beings who have the capacity to leap over this ocean. Garuda, or you or the Windgod. \"What means do you, being the foremost hero among the three who are capable performing this difficult task, foresee? \"O slayer of enemy heroes if you alone can accomplish this task the fame of doing this will be yours. \"It would be worthy of Rama if he with his entire army emerges victorious over Ravana in a battle and takes me to his city. \"If Kakutstha (Rama), slayer of the enemy army fills the entire Lanka with his arrows and takes me, then his action will be worthy of him. \"You may make arrangement in such a manner that, that great self, the hero in war makes his victorious march which is worthy of him.\" Having heard the meaningful, courteous and logical words of Sita, Hanuman replied: \"O Devi the lord of monkeys, Sugriva heads the army of vanaras and bears. He is richly endowed with satvaguna and is determined to accomplish your cause and free you from sorrow. \"O Vaidehi Sugriva will reach this place with thousands of crores of vanaras very soon and would kill all the ogres. \"Valiant, virtuous and powerful vanaras who can leap with the speed of mind are awaiting orders (of Sugriva). \"Their course cannot be impeded either upward, or downward or right or left. They  are indeed very brilliant and would never fail in any task. \"They have often circumambulated the earth including its oceans and mountains through the aerial path with great enthusiasm. \"The vanaras under Sugriva who move in the forest are more powerful than me or equal to me. None is inferior to me. \"If I have managed to come here, why not the other powerful ones? The superior leaders are not sent (as messengers). Only ordinary ones like me are. \"O noble lady therefore, give up your agony. Enough of your lamentation. The monkey troops will reach this place in one stride. \"Both the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, lions among men, looking brilliant like Sun and Moon will come to you riding on my back. \"Both the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana will come and blow up the city of Lanka with their unfailing arrows. \"O beautiful lady Raghava, the delight of the Raghu race would kill Ravana and his kins and return with you to his city \"Therefore, count the days and rest assured. Let it be auspicious to you. You will shortly see Rama burning like fire. \"When Ravana is slain, with his sons, ministers and kith and kin, you will reunite with Rama as Rohini unites with the Moon. \"O queen Mythili you come to the end of your sorrow and will soon see Ravana killed by Rama\". Having thus consoled Vaidehi, Hanuman, son of the Windgod resolved to depart. Once again he spoke to Vadehi: \"Very soon you would see the slayer of foes, who is an accomplished wielder of the bow (Rama) along with Lakshmana at the entrance of Lanka. \"You will soon see heroic vanaras whose weapons are their teeth, who are like lion and tiger in their valour. They are (mighty) like wellbred elephants. \"O respectable lady you would see many troops of vanara chiefs who resemble clouds hovering on the mountain peaks of Lankaroaring. \"Rama is tormented by the dreadful arrows of the god of love pierced into vitals, like an elephant hit by a lion. He has no happiness in life. \"O devi weep no more.Entertain no unpleasant thoughts.You have a great husband, just as Sachi has her lord Indra. \"Who is superior to Rama? Who is equal to Lakshmana? Both the brothers are like Fire and Wind. They are your refuge. \"O noble lady You will not stay longer in this country, which is a strong hold of hosts of demons and a dreadful place It will not be very long before you unite with your beloved. Pray, have  patience till then.       Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Sita who was like the daughter of the gods heard the son of the Windgod for her benefit and replied: \"O vanara just as the earth feels happy when the half grown crops receive rain, I feel happy after seeing you. You have been speaking pleasing words \"Be kind to me and act in such a manner that I may embrace my lord passionately with my body emaciated with grief. \"O best leader of vanaras remind Rama about the incident of the release of a blade of grass in anger blinding one of the eyes of the crow narrated to you. '(Further remind him), 'When my tilaka mark was erased, you painted tilaka with a stone (manassita pigment) nearby. O Rama you should remember that (incident). 'Rama you are like Indra and Varuna in valiance. How are you tolerating Sita seized, dwelling among the demons? \"O sinless Rama this wonderful Chudamani of mine has been carefully safeguarded. Seeing this is like seeing you when I am in distress. \"I am sending you this (Chudamani) born of the sea.

He looks at me with immoral (lusty) eyes. I do not wish to live even for a moment after hearing about the adversities (you have faced).\" Hearing the words of Sita who was weeping piteously, brilliant Hanuman said this: \"O irreproachable lady I swear by you that Rama has grown averse to everything out of grief of separation from you. When Rama is in grief even Lakshmana gets immersed in sorrow. \"O beautiful lady somehow I could meet you. This is not the time to worry about. You will see the end of suffering at this very moment. \"Both the princes are tigers among men and crushers of enemies. They are determined to see you, and will reduce Lanka to ashes. \"O largeeyed lady Killing in war the vile Ravana, the demon king and all his relatives, Rama would take you back to his own city \"O unimpeachable lady give one more identification which would make him more happy\". \"I have already given the best identification. When you hand this jewel used on my hair to him,  he will believe what you tell him\". The illustrious vanara held the ornament, prostrated to Sita and prepared to depart. Seeing Hanuman eager to leap, enlarging his body quickly, she appeared pitiable with her face filled with tears and throat choked. Seeing Hanuman eager to leap, enlarging his body quickly, she appeared pitiable with her face filled with tears and throat choked. \"O Hanuman to the lionlike brothers Rama and Lakshmana, to Sugriva  including his ministers and to every one convey my good wishes. \"You should make efforts in such a manner that the mightyarmed Rama will help me in crossing the cean of sorrow. \"Foremost vanara tell Rama about my intense grief as well as the threats of the demons. May your journey be happy. Hanuman understood the message of princess Sita and felt delighted at heart at his accomplishment. Considering the small task yet to be accomplished he reached the northern shore mentally (He thought of Rama who waited in Kishkinda which is in the northern direction).       Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having been honoured and praised by Sita's words, Hanuman prepared to depart from Sita's presence. 'With demons, negotiation is of no use. They are wealthy, they need no gifts. Proud of their stregth, the demons will not yield to dissension. I think only by using power it can be done. 'Other than power, there is no way to accomplish the task of ascertaining their strength. If I slay a few strong ogres somehow they may soften a little and yield. 'He, who can perform tasks in addition to the objective accomplished without affecting it, is really worthy. 'There are ways more than one even to perform a small work. And the capable know it. 'If I ascertain the difference in the strength of enemies and vanaras in war here itself and return to Kishkinda, the abode of vanaras, then I would have executed the orders of my lord properly. 'How can I have enduring war with the ogres today? How will my visit to this place end in happy return? Only in a combat this tenheaded Ravana will guage his strength and mine 'I can return happily only after I gauge the tenheaded Ravana's army in war, his strength, his companions including the ministers and his mind. 'This Ashoka garden of Ravana filled with different kinds of trees and creepers is a feast to the eyes and mind. It is an excellent garden like the Nandana  garden of Indra. 'I will devastate this garden, just as fire destroys a dried up forest. This will enrage Ravana. 'Then the demon king will order the horses, chariots and elephants and army equipped with tridents and spears to march against me. A great war will take place. 'I will fight with the ogres sent by Ravana, endowed with fierce strength and irresistible valour. After destroying their army I will go to the abode of vanaras happily'. Furious Maruti endowed with fierce valour started uprooting the trees with the speed sprung from his thighs like the Windgod. Then Hanuman felled a variety of trees and vines inhabited by intoxicated birds in the beautiful garden meant for womenfolk. That garden looked ugly with uprooted trees, breached ponds and powdered mountain peaks. Vines and trees wilted, birds shrieking, the embankments of ponds destroyed, its tender coppery red shoots withered, the garden looked as though it is burnt by forest fire and the climbers looked like women shivering in fear with their robes disarrayed. Vines and trees wilted, birds shrieking, the embankments of ponds destroyed, its tender coppery red shoots withered, the garden looked as though it is burnt by forest fire and the climbers looked like women shivering in fear with their robes disarrayed. The great garden lay disfigured, with the arbours and the picture galleries ruined, huge serpents and wild animals scattered, with stone houses and sheds destroyed. The pleasuregarden of Ravana appeared as though it was spreading the creepers of sorrow, since it was totally destroyed by the monkey who had set out to protect a woman.   of the pleasure garden,  of the hero who came to protect a lady. The great vanara having perpetrated mischief, rousing anger in the mind of the great lord of wealth, stood at the exit doorway ready to combat singlehanded with many warriors in that  mighty army blazing in glory.       Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The residents of Lanka panicked at the shrieking sounds of birds and cracking sounds of trees. The frightened beasts and birds ran and flew, screeching in all directions. Fierce portents appeared to the demons. Hideouslooking ogresses, awakened from sleep, saw the garden devastated by the heroic Vanara. When the powerful, mighty and strongarmed Hanuman saw the ogresses he assumed a very huge form in order to strike terror in them. Then, seeing the huge body of the mighty vanara resembling a mountain the ogresses questioned Janaki about him. \"Who is he? By whom has he been sent? From where and why did he come here? What dialogue  did you have with him? \"O lovely, largeeyed lady O auspicious one have no fear. What conversation did he have with you? Tell us\". Chaste and beautiful Sita said, \"How do I know about the ogresses who assume many fierce forms?\" \"You alone can know about who he is and what he is about. A serpent alone knows the movement (footprints) of another serpent. There is no doubt about it. \"I am also scared of him. I do not know who he is. I think he is a demon, who came here assuming a form of his choice. LIstening to Vaidehi's words the ogresses divided themselves and fled in all directions. While some stood there, others went to report to Ravana. The uglyfaced ogresses went to the presence of Ravana and reported about the frightening form of the vanara. \"Your majesty an extremely powerful and frightening Vanara had a dialogue with Sita. He is stationed in the midst of Ashoka garden. \"The deereyed Sita is not willing to disclose to us his identity even when we questioned her. \"He may be an envoy of Indra or Kubera or of Rama sent with an intent to trace Sita. \"Your beautiful pleasure garden filled with a variety of beasts has been ruined by this wonderful figure. There is not a single place that has not been ruined by him there. Only the place where Janaka's daughter, Sita is resting has not been touched. \"It is not clear whether he spared that place for protecting Janakai or he stopped due to exhaustion. What is fatigue for him? It must be to save her that she is spared by him. \"He has spared the simsupa tree with lovely, tender leaves and flowers which is a chosen  resort by Sita. \"Your highness should take severe action on that person of fierce appearance with whom Sita dared to speak, and by whom the garden is ruined. \"O lord of the demon clan Who dares to talk to Sita if he has not given up all hope of life, since she is desired by you\". On listening to the report of the ogresses, Ravana, the lord of demons flared up like blazing flame of a sacrificial fire, his eyeballs rolling in rage. From his angry eyes fell down drops of tears just as burning drops of oil drip from two burning lamps. Then powerful Ravana commanded heroic demons called kinkaras who vied in strength to catch Hanuman. Eighty thousand powerful  kinkaras (a clan of demons), largebellied, with large teeth and of dreadful appearance, swift in action, armed with hammers and clubs marched from there, resolved to capture Hanuman. Eighty thousand powerful  kinkaras (a clan of demons), largebellied, with large teeth and of dreadful appearance, swift in action, armed with hammers and clubs marched from there, resolved to capture Hanuman. The kinkaras rushed towards the leader of vanaras who stood near the archway like the moths rushing towards the flame. They assailed Hanuman with iron maces, crowbars edged with gold and shining arrows resembling the Sun. They quickly surrounded Hanuman and stood with hammers, sharpedged spears, tridents, barbed missiles and powerful javelins. Gigantic Hanuman, illustrious and brilliant, roared and waved his tail striking it with force on the ground causing loud sound. Hanuman, son of Maruti, enlarged his body to a huge size and patted himself wildly  making loud noise that echoed the entire Lanka. By the highly frightening sound caused by Hanuman patting, the birds from the sky fell down making a loud noise and Hanuman proclaimed in a loud voice as follows: \"Victory to Rama, the mighty and powerful, Victory to Lakshmana. Victory to king Sugriva who is ruled by Rama.\" \"I, son of the Windgod, destroyer of hostile armies, am a servant of Rama, the lord of Kosala kingdom, a man of unwearied action. Even a thousand Ravanas will not match me in strength when I pound stones and trees in a thousand ways. \"I shall destroy the city of Lanka and pay my respects to Mythili right under the nose of all demons. I will return with my purpose accomplished. Terrified on hearing the roar, the kinkaras looked at the towering Hanuman who seemed like a cloud in twilight (red in colour). Obeying their king's commnad, putting aside their fear, the kinkaras freely attacked the vanara  from all directions with dreadful weapons. Extremely powerful Hanuman surrounded by heroes all over, on his part went to the archway and picked up a terrific iron beam. Hanuman, the mighty hero, seized the iron beam and struck the kinkaras, just as Garuda, the son of Vinata shoots up a struggling serpent and starts taking strides in the sky with the weapon in his hand (like Indra with his thunderbolt did with demons). The great Windgod's son killed the kinkaras, and returned to the archway desiring further combat. Then a few surviving ogres took to their heels after getting over that shock and reported to Ravana of the destruction of the kinkaras in the combat The mighty demon king having heard about the killing of the formidable army of ogres, his eyes rolling in rage, commanded the son of Prahasta, who is difficult to conquer and matchless in war.       Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having slain the kinkaras, Hanuman stood and reflected, ' I have ruined the garden and not the palatial buildings that are like temples (Chaityas)'. Then Hanuman, son of the Windgod, decided in his mind to show his strength and jumped on to the top of the palatial building that appeared like the peak of mount Meru. Having slain the kinkaras, Hanuman stood and reflected, ' I have ruined the garden and not the palatial buildings that are like temples (Chaityas)'.

Then Hanuman, son of the Windgod, decided in his mind to show his strength and jumped on to the top of the palatial building that appeared like the peak of mount Meru. The powerful vanara leader climbed the tall, palatial building which resembled a mountain. He looked like another Sun, just risen. Having destroyed the fine palace building, the indomitable Hanuman was blazing with glory like the mountain Pariyatra. (one of the seven Kula mountains viz., Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Shuktiman, Riksha, Vindhya and Pariyatra) Hanuman heaved his body  huge  with his prowess and patted his arms loudly filling the city of Lanka with that terrible sound. By the deafening sound caused by the patting, the birds fell down and the guards of the palace lost consciousness. 'May Sri Rama, unsurpassed in the use of missiles be victorious May his brother, mighty Lakshmana, a matchless warrior be victorious. May King Sugriva ruled by Rama be victorious.' 'I am the son of the Windgod, destroyer of enemy army. I am a servant of Rama, the king of Kosala who can accomplish any task with ease. 'Not even a thousand Ravanas can stand my might  in combat as I start assailing them with thousands of  rocks or even trees. 'I shall return only after accomplishing the destruction of the city of Lanka and offering obeisance to Sita, while all demons keep looking at me'. Having made proclamations that way from the top of the Vimana (palace) the monkey leader roared making terrific sound frightening the ogres. Hearing the terrific sound, a hundred gigantic guards of the palace set forth, holding different kinds of weapons like darts, swords and axes and hurled at Maruti surrounding him. Holding astonishing maces decorated with gold, iron crowbars and sharp arrows resembling the rays of the Sun the ogres hit Hanuman, the foremost of vanaras. The demons surrounding the great monkey looked like a big whirlpool of the water of the river Ganga. Thereupon the infuriated son of the Windgod, assumed a fearsome form, uprooted a pillar of the palace decked with gold and holding that hundred edged pillar whirled it round swiftly. Thereupon the infuriated son of the Windgod, assumed a fearsome form, uprooted a pillar of the palace decked with gold and holding that hundred edged pillar whirled it round swiftly. Thereafter fire was generated (through friction) and with if the palace blazed. Hanuman saw the palace burning. He killed a hundred demons there as Indra killed demons with his thunderbolt. (The whirling pillar that generated fire apeared like a thunderbolt) Later he stood in the air and proclaimed this: Thereafter fire was generated (through friction) and with if the palace blazed.

He went round twanging his producing thunderous sound. His arrows were huge, shining and beautiful. All directions including the intermediate directions and the sky were filled with that loud sound produced by his twang. Seeing him coming in a chariot drawn by donkeys, Hanuman who was swift to act was glad (to have an opportunity to fight) and made a loud noise. Strongarmed Jambumali with his sharp arrows hit great Hanuman who stood on top of the exit archway. Jambumali released a crescentshaped arrow on the face, one earshaped (barbed) arrow on the head and ten iron arrows into the arms of the lord of monkeys. His red face struck by an arrow appeared like a fullblown lotus in autumn season hit  by  the rays of the Sun. His red face  stained with blood was glowing bright like red lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of red sandal. Struck by the shafts of the ogre, the great monkey was enraged and happened to see a huge,  heavy rock lying beside him on the ground. Powerful Hanuman with all vehemence lifted the rock and hurled it at the giant which he angrily smashed with ten arrows. Hanuman, a strong, powerful and fierce warrior pulled out a sala tree and whirled it. Seeing that his attempt has failed. Gigantic Jambumali seeing the mighty Hanuman whirling the sala tree fired many arrows at him. He struck the sala tree with four arows, the arm of Hanuman with five arrows, chest with one, the hollow of the chest with ten more arrows. Hanuman filled with arrows all over his body, seized an iron spear (which he made use of in the initial battle) and impetuously spun it in  intense anger. Hanuman of immeasurable strength hurled the iron spear after turning it round and round at high speed on the broad chest of Jambumali. Neither his head could be discerned nor his arms, knees, nor bow, chariot nor donkeys. Nothing was seen. Mighty Jambumali killed  by that blow dropped down dead at once with his ornaments reduced to powder. Ravana's eyes became bloodshot in anger when he heard about the death of Jambumali and of the strong army of kinkaras. When the mighty son of Prahasta was killed, infuriated Ravana, his eyes red and rolling, commanded the highly valiant sons of ministers.

They went roaring with their chariots rattling, sending forth torrents of arrows like the stormy clouds thundering. Later, Hanuman covered with showers of arrows scattered all over appeared like the king of mountains shot with showers of rain.

The elephants trumpeted discordantly out of fear, the horses fell down on the ground and even the chariots with seats, parasols and flag staffs broken were strewn all over the ground. Streams of blood flowed and Lanka was filled with many kinds of horrifying sounds of cries.

Taking King's order, the strong and swift warriors, resplendent as the flame of sacrificial fire sallied forth with their army on chariots, on the back of rutting elephants,  some on swift horses equipped with sharp weapons of many kinds.

The heroic giants caught sight of the vanara, who was blazing  encircled as though he was by the rays of his own glory, looking like the rising Sun. He was endowed with extraordinary agility, intelligence, and tremendous strength standing, waiting at the archway. Having observed the tremendous strength, intelligence and swiftness in action of Hanuman, the generals of the army positioned at all directions and assailed him with dreadful weapons. Durdhara pierced into the head of Hanuman with five sharp arrows and polished steel shafts with yellow tips (gold) shining like red lotus petals. They were like petals of lilies thrown on the head of Hanuman (causing no pain). With five arrows pierced in the head of the vanara, Hanuman leaped into the sky with terrible roar, which resounded in all the ten directions. Then the powerful, hero, Durdhara, mounted on his chariot, fastened his bowstring and hit Hanuman with hundreds of sharp arrows. The great monkey kept away the showering arrows like the wind prevents raincloud from showering rain drops at the end of monsoon. When the son of the Windgod was attacked by Durdhara, he again grew in size Hanuman suddenly leaped far off into the air at high speed and fell on Durdhara's chariot just like a thunderous lightning falls on a mountain. Having lost his chariot, the horses yoked to it killed, its axle and pole broken to pieces, Durdhara fell down dead from the chariot. Seeing the body of Durdhara fallen on the ground, enraged Virupaksha and Yupaksha, the unassailable crushers of enemies leaped towards him. As the strongarmed vanara stood stationed in the clear white sky both the generals leaped into the sky and hit him all of a sudden with two iron hammers. Powerful Hanuman, an equal to Garuda in valour fell down while resisting the swift generals. Then the son of the Windgod seized a sala tree uprooted it, lifted it and smashed the two giant generals with it. Finding all the three generals dead, swift Praghasa advanced towards the Vanara and attacked him. Valiant Bhasakarna also lifted a trident and attacked him. Both were famous for swift and violent action in war Finding all the three generals dead, swift Praghasa advanced towards the Vanara and attacked him. Valiant Bhasakarna also lifted a trident and attacked him. Both were famous for swift and violent action in war Praghasa fought back the glorious tiger among vanaras with a sharp crowbar on one side and Bhaskarana attacked with a spear from the other. Attacked by both the generals, the fur on the vanara's body was smeared with blood from his wounded limbs, shining like the rising Sun smeared with blood became furious. Hanuman, a courageous and mighty elephant among the monkeys uprooted a mountain peak along with its animals, serpents and trees and killed both the demon generals. When the five army chiefs were killed, Hanuman began to destoy the remaining army force. The vanara pitted horses against horses, elephants against elephants, warriors against warriors and chariots against chariots as Indra destroyed demons. There was no path (one could not move forward) with elephants, and horses killed and with broken axles of great chariots and smashed chariots spread all over the way. Then the heroic monkey having killed the army generals and their army and destroyed their vehicles in war came back to the archway after reviewing and stood like the timespirit bent upon the destruction of humanity.       Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the sad news of death of the five army generals including their followers and destruction of their vehicles, King (Ravana) gave a suggestive look at prince Aksha who was inclined to fight the war. Spurred by the mere glance of Ravana, the glorious Aksha with his wonderful bow inlaid with gold sprang up from the royal assembly just as flame rises from firesanctuary when oblations are poured in by reputed brahmins. Ascending a glittering chariot inlaid with pure gold Aksha, the courageous bull among giants looking splendid like the rising Sun, marched forth towards the great vanara. The chariot was (strong as it was) gained by his austerities of high order. It was overlaid with pure gold armour, fixed with flags, and staff, studded with precious gems, yoked to the best of eight horses and endowed with the speed of mind. (The chariot) was unassailable to suras or asuras.It moved without touching the ground, it could fly in air and had the splendour of the Sun. It was equipped readily with quivers, eight swords, javelins and clubs placed in right order. Prince Aksha, whose courage was equal to that of gods, shone like the Sun. He ascended the splendid chariot decked with golden garlands shining like Sun and Moon, equipped with all weapons, bows and shields etc, he went out. Seated on the chariot he (Aksha) sallied forth along with the army filling the entire earth and mountains with the sounds of horses, elephants and rumblings of big chariots and reached the portal where the great vanara stood. The lioneyed Aksha saw the vanara who appeared like the cosmic fire at the time of dissolution of the universe. The prince was astonished and struck with awe (at the majestic form of the Vanara) and looked at him with great  respect. Aksha, the mighty prince judging the speed and prowess of the monkey with his own in confronting enemies and the strength of the monkey, began to swell up in spirit like the glow of the Sun at the end of winter. Knowing that it is difficult to win Hanuman who was steady and of irresistible valour Aksha was angry. Remaining steady, with full attention, he provoked the vanara to fight and released three sharp arrows. Then Aksha contempuously looked at Hanuman who had conquered his fatigue and was determined to defeat the enemy. Holding in his hands his bow and arrows proudly, he reflected. Adorned with armlets studded with golden coins and lovely earrings Aksha advanced instantaneously to meet the monkey. Their matchless combat excuitement and enthusiasm even among gods and demons. Witnessing the fight between Hanuman and Prince Aksha, even the earth shrieked in agony, the Sun became dim, the wind stopped blowing, mountains were shaken, the sky thundered and even the ocean was agitated. Heroic Aksha, who was good at targeting correctly, with due  concentration struck the vanara on his head with three goldenshafted, winged arrows with feathers smeared with poison which resembled serpents. With the three arrows shot on his forehead simultaneously his eyes were drenched with flowing blood and with arrows shining like rays he appeared like the rising Sun, garlanded by glowing rays. Hanuman, the esteemed minister of the copperyeyed Sugriva observed the prince holding manifold splendid weapons. He rejoiced, grew in size ready to fight, making the necessary prepararions (taking the required position). Huge Hanuman, endowed with strength and valour looked  like the rising Sun on the peak of mount Mandara. He looked at prince Aksha and his army as well as his vehicles as though he was burning them with the rays emerging from his fiery eyes. Aksha, with his wonderful quiver and bow, began to rain rapidly a shower of arrows in the battle, on the mountainlike monkeylord just as a cloud rains on a mountain. Then Hanuman saw prince Aksha, endowed with excessive splendour, power and energy advancing in a fierce manner like a cloud in the battle. Then Hanuman happy (to see the heroic prince) roared like a clap of thunder. Young Aksha, proud of his valour with eyes bloodshot in anger rushed towards the matchless Hanuman, just as an elephant would approach a huge pitfall covered with grass. Struck by the arrows released by prince Aksha, Hanuman roared violently like a thundering cloud and leaped into the sky  putting up a fierce appearance, stretching his arms and thighs. Dodging like the wind  between the arrows and also escaping the arrows Hanuman, who was swift in movement like the mind, was seen exhibiting his terrific valour in the battle while he moved in the sky. Admiring the young Aksha's appearance, his skill in holding the quiver and spreading the excellent arrows with missiles and facing the war, Hanuman became thoughtful (as to how to kill him). The strongarmed Hanuman, who was aware of the propriety of actions, wounded in his arms by the warrior prince started roaring and thinking about the next strategy in the combat. 'He (Aksha) is like the radiant, rising Sun with extraordinary might. He is accomplishing great deeds unlike young warriors of his age and is exhibiting a magnificent feat. He knows all means of fighting. I do not feel like cutting him to size. My mind does not allow me to kill this boy. 'He is a great self. His valour is also admirable. He is focused in battle and highly tolerant. There is no doubt that on account of his excellence  even nagas, yakshas and sages offer salutations to him. 'His mental horizon is enhanced by his valour and power. He is standing before me and dares to look into my eyes. Surely his swift movement and valour will shake  even the minds of suras and asuras. If I ignore him now, he would get the better of me (I have to consider his challenge seriously). His valour in the battle is growing. It is proper to subdue him now. A spreading fire cannot be neglected. Reflecting on the power of the enemy, the mighty and valiant vanara thought of his own course of action. Hanuman made up his mind to kill the enemy and increased his speed. Hanuman the brave son of the Windgod hit with his palm and killed the eight horses (yoked to Aksha's chariot) which had great speed were stable and had the capacity to  bear heavy loads while turning round in the sky. (The battle was fought in the air since Hanuman leaped into the air and the demon hero had to resist him there). Then hit by Hanuman with his palm, the minister of the copperyeyed Sugriva, the huge chariot seat of Aksha was broken, the wooden frame of the yoke was disjointed, horses were  slain and the great chariot fell down from the sky. (Aksha) the great charioteer abandoned the chariot, held a sword and a bow, and flew up to the region of the sky with his fierce power just as a sage with his fearsome ascetic power ascends to heaven, leaving his body. Thereupon Hanuman with the prowess that was equal to wind, approaching the sky firmly caught hold of the legs of Aksha flying into the abode of Garuda, the Windgod and the Siddhas. Hanuman, the foremost of the vanaras who was equal to his father in valour, seized him just as Garuda, the lord of birds, would seize a great serpent. And spinning him round speedily a thousand times and hitting him, dropped him on the earth. Hit by Hanuman, the ogre's arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, bones rendered to fragments, eyes protruded, joints disjointed, tendons strewn he was thrown down on the earth dripping blood. When the great vanara dashed Aksha down on to the earth, the king of demons was struck with terror. The great sages who go round the planets, great seers who were observants of vows, yakshas, panagas, suras including Indra all beings collected together and looked at the vanara with awe. Hanuman, the hero with bloodshot eyes having  slain Aksha, shone resplendent like the son of Indra (Jayanta), and reached the portal, and waited looking like the god of death determined to destroy all beings.       Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter the great demon king, mighty angry at the death of Aksha in the hands of Hanuman, controlled his feeling and ordered Indrajit who was like a godhead. \"You are an expert in wielding astras (missiles) and foremost among the wielders of weapons. You are highly efficient. You have brought grief even to suras and asuras. You are a warrior of proven ability demonstrated in your war against the gods including Indra. By propitiating, (through penance), grandfather Brahma you have acquired many missiles. \"None could face you in war including Indra, Maruts and gods because of your skill and the power of your astras. \"Excepting you there is none who has not experienced fatigue in war in the three worlds. You alone are intelligent in fighting. You are protected by the strength of your arms and power of austerity. You are aware of the proper place and time of action. \"Nothing is impossible for you in war. You do not consider with your wise judgment any action unfit for undertaking. There is none in all the three worlds who is unaware of the strength of your weapons and your power to recall through Mantra the weapon you have discharged. \"The power of your penance, your valour and your ability to discharge astras in war is equal only to mine. I am not bothered about the consequences of war you wage because your victory is certain. \"All the kinkaras , Jambumali, the heroic demons, sons of the ministers and five army generals were slain. Battalions of well-equipped army including horses, elephants and chariots were also destroyed. \"Your dear young brother Aksha is killed. O scourage of enemies I do not have the faith in them as I have in you. \"O intelligent warrior measure the  strength, power and valour of the monkey and  your own strength carefully. Exercise your own strength and speed accordingly. \"O  warrior of extraordinary merit among the wielders of astras  asses your strength approach the enemy in a manner by which he is subdued without causing further destruction to our army. Carefully measure your own strength and your enemy's  before you start fighting. \"O hero take no large army as it is futile with this monkey endowed with extraordinary vigour. Even a thunderbolt can do nothing. He is like the wind and has no match in speed. He is like the sacrificial fire who cannot be destroyed by weapons. \"Assess the situation properly. You are a person of sound judgement. You are a master in weaponry. Recollect the strength of your bow and divine astras and march forward with a singleminded attention. Act in a manner that does not bring your doom. \"I am reluctant to send you to war in the circumstances. But you are the best choice for me. However, certainly this is the duty of a kshatriya who follows the science of polity. Hence I am sending you. \"O subduer of enemies you are capable of handling different kinds of weapons. Therefore, understand that I seek only your ultimate triumph in war. Hearing the father's words (of exhortation), he, who is never distressed at the prospect of war decided to seek the battle as he was powerful like the son of Daksha, and went round his father with respect. Having been honoured by his own kith and kin who loved him, Indrajit rushed forth for war with martial vigour. When the illustrious son of Ravana, the highly Indrajit resplendent with eyes of lotus petals marched ahead he looked like the turbulent ocean on a fullmoon day. Like Indra, Indrajit ascended the chariot (which had the standard of Indra as it was seized from him as a token of his having conquered Indra) yoked to four sharptoothed tigers. It moved in swiftness vying with Garuda, the king of birds in speed. Mounted on the chariot, Indrajit, the best in archery and an expert in weaponry went quickly to the place where that great Hanuman was stationed. The leader of the monkey also became happier on hearing the rumbling (of the chariot) and the twang of Indrajit's bowstring. Indrajit who was an adept in warfare, picked his highly powerful bow and aimed his sharpedged arrow at Hanuman. When he sallied forth happily holding a bow full of passion for war, darkness prevailed in all quarters and it became gloomy. Beasts began to howl in various frightful ways. (To see the combat) the Nagas, Yakshas, seers and Siddhas who move round the heavenly orbits assembled in the sky. The birds collected  in flocks in the sky and screeched loudly and happily. Hanuman of very high speed enlarged his body and roared, perceiving Indrajit's chariot coming swiftly. Indrajit on his part sat in his divine chariot holding a wonderful bow and in a lightning speed twanged it. Then the son of the demon king and Hanuman, both very fast in speed, mighty and powerful, fearless in war and like sura and asura closed in upon each other. Hanuman of immeasurable strength heaved himself to a huge proprtion and went moving on the path of his father (windgod) rendering useless the extraordinary speed of the arrows of Indrajit, who was great in chariot warfare, and an efficient archer. Then the heroic Indrajit, slayer of enemy warriors, discharged long arrows that were fixed with fine feathers with sharppointed gold tips, bent a little at the tip touching the bow string, as swift as lightning. Thereupon, hearing the rumbling of the chariot, the sounds of mrudangas, bheris, and patahas drawing towards him, and percieving the loud twang of the bow (of Indrajit) Hanuman sprang up again. The great tawny monkey moved quickly between spaces of arrows that were aimed at him rendering hosts of Indrajit's targets futile. Hanuman, son of the Windgod again stood facing the arrows directly stretching his hands and jumped (into the air). Both the warriors endowed with speed and skill in warfare carried on the fight which captivated the minds of all creatures. The demon did not find a way to hit Hanuman. Maruti also found no opportunity to hit great Indrajit. Both of them being equal to gods in valour became too much to each other in war. (Both of them moved at meteoric speed making it difficult to aim at the enemy.) Indrajit's infallible arrows missed Hanuman. Then the great warrior became perplexed and started thinking seriously within himself entering into a reflective mood. Then Indrajit, son of the demon king, thinking that a vanara should not be killed started considering other means of catching hm. Then the heroic master of weapons, an excellent and glorious warrior directed the  Brahmastram towards the foremost of monkeys. Indrajit, the strongarmed hero, who knew the secrets of all missiles, realising that the son of the Windgod cannot be killed caught him by the divine weapon of Brahma (Brahmastram). Then Hanuman bound by the weapon of the demon was unable to move and fell on the ground. The monkey leader realised that his speed was arrested by the power of the lord Brahma, by the strength of the bond of Brahmastram. He then recalled lord Brahma's boon to him. Hanuman realised that it was by invoking creator Brahma and applying the mantra that he was caught by Brahmastram. On that occasion he started thinking of the boon given to him  by Grandsire Brahma : 'I deem it an effect of the power of Brahma. It is not possiblle for me to free myself due to the power of the great lord presiding over the universe through the astra. It should be obeyed'. Reflecting within himself about the power of the astra, Hanuman recalled Braham's favour to him. He recalled his own power to liberate himself from the Brahmastra and resolved to abide by the order of Brahma. 'Even though I am bound by the astra, I have the protection of both Brahma and Indra as well as the Windgod. Hence there is no cause for apprension. 'If I am caught by the demon I will have the opportunity to see the demon lord. Therefore, let me be caught by my enemies'. Hanuman, a destroyer of enemies, who assesses before he acts, resolved (to submit to the ordinance of Brahma), to be silent (the power of his movement affected). When the enemy forces came to him slowly and slowly, siezed him forcibly and abused him, he roared. Then the ogres had Hanuman, the subduer of enemies, who made no effort to move, bound with hemp rope and bark robes. Bound by the enemy warriors, Hanuman, decided to bear all humiliations, thinking, 'May be the demon king might come to see me out of curiosity if he is so disposed'. On being bound by bark ropes Hanuman was set free from the bond of Brahmastra, since  the bondage of Brahmastra does not tolerate another ordinary bondage. Then the heroic Indrajit coming to know that the foremost of the monkeys bound by bark ropes was released from the bondage of Brahmastra, thought, 'indeed the divine weapon does not tolerate other bonds, so the vanara is released'. 'Alas! my achievement has been wasted. The ogres had not considered the impact of the mantra of astra . Once the Brahmastra is ineffective another astra cannot be operative again. We are all running a risk.' Though binding and dragging by the ogres had hurt Hanuman, he on his part did not know that he had been released from Brahmastra. The cruel ogres hit Hanuman with sticks and fists and dragged him to the presence of the demon lord. Then Indarjit, seeing the powerful Hanuman, the foremost of monkeys who was released from the Brahmastra, still bound by bark ropes, presented him to the ogres and their master in the royal assembly. The ogres presented the best of monkeys, Hanuman looking like an elephant in rut to Ravana, the demon king. \"Who is he? Whose son is he? Why has he come here? Where has he come from? What business does he have here?\" Thus the heroic demons talked among themselves. Thereafter other ogres angrily said 'Let us kill him, burn him or otherwise devour him,' thus they spoke to one another. The great Hanuman moving quickly and crossing the path came near the feet of the king. He saw the aged and experienced ministers of the king and the palace of the king adorned with precious gems. Resplendent Ravana saw  the ogres of ugly appearance dragging the foremost of the monkeys here and there. Hanuman the best of monkeys also saw the demon king who had both splendour and strength, radiating brilliance like the Sun. That tenheaded rakshasa king, rolling his red eyes rapidly in rage and observing the monkey unwinkingly ordered the noble and aged ministers of his clan to interrogate Hanuman. At the very outset they questioned Hanuman manner in the usual about the place he came from and the purpose. Hanuman reported, 'I am Hanuman. I came as a messenger by the order of the king of monkeys'.       Thus ends the fortyeigth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The highly courageous Hanuman, astonished at  the  action (of binding and dragging him to the court) by the demon king looked at him with eyes turned red in anger. (Hanuman looked at Ravana) of innate splendour, who shone with a glittering crown of gold glowing, encircled with strings of pearls. He was decked with wonderful golden ornaments studded with diamonds and had small motifs of precious gems fixed to them. They were as though designed by imagination. (An ornament made with the hand connot be so fine and delicate.) He was dressed in exquisite silk and smeared with red sandal paste and had many ornamental designs drawn on his body with fragrant unguents. He appeared terrible with bloodred eyes, shining sharp big teeth, drooping lips and ten heads, which looked like ten peaks of mountain Mandara inhabited by various beasts. He was heroic, powerful and splendid. He appeared terrible with bloodred eyes, shining sharp big teeth, drooping lips and ten heads, which looked like ten peaks of mountain Mandara inhabited by various beasts. He was heroic, powerful and splendid. He was like a black mountain of collyrium, and with a face like the fullmoon. With a pearl necklace illumining his chest he appeared like a cloud lit up by the fullmoon with white cranes flying across. (The white pearlnecklace moving on his chest appeared like a row of cranes flying through the black cloud.) Adorned with armlets (keyura), smeared with choicest sandal paste, his shining, stout armlets appeared like many fivehooded serpents (fingers appearing like hoods). (He was) seated on a huge magnificent throne of crystal encrusted with precious stones and overspread with a wonderful carpet. Young and beautiful girls decorated exceedingly well holding whisks all over the vicinity attended on him. He was attended by Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparsva and Nikumbha who were his learned ministers. Seated comfortably and attended by the four arrogant ministers, he was puffed with pride of their strength and appeared like the entire world surrounded by four oceans. He was attended by Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparsva and Nikumbha who were his learned ministers. Seated comfortably and attended by the four arrogant ministers, he was puffed with pride of their strength and appeared like the entire world surrounded by four oceans. He was attended by ogres including ministers who were intellectuals and adept in counselling. He appeared like lord Indra attended by the gods. Hanuman saw the highly resplendent giant king (seated on the throne) who appeared like a cloud laden with water appearing on the peak of mount Meru. Hanuman looked at the demon king with great amazement even while he was dealt harshly by the demons of fierce valour. Seeing the splendour of the lord of demons, Hanuman was dimayed and started thinking thus: 'Oh what charm what courage what strength what splendour How great is this demonking, an endowment of all merits. 'If only this lord of demons was not unrighteous, he could have become even the lord (protector) of gods including Indra. 'This Ravana has done many cruel, fierce and contemptible deeds. That is why even the demons, gods and all the people of this world get scared of him. He will render the entire world into a single ocean when he turns angry'. Many such thoughts crossed Hanuman's intelligent mind on seeing Ravana's brilliance and power.       Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The mighty armed Ravana, a tormentor of all worlds, overcome with anger beheld the tawnyeyed brilliant lord of monkeys who stood before him and started thinking in his mind full of apprehensions. 'Is he Lord Nandi who came here in person? I was earlier cursed by him when I shook the mount Kailasa in the past. Could he have assumed a monkeyform or may be he is the great demon Bana. (Nandi is the bull, the vehicle of Lord Siva). 'Is he Lord Nandi who came here in person? I was earlier cursed by him when I shook the mount Kailasa in the past. Could he have assumed a monkeyform or may be he is the great demon Bana. (Nandi is the bull, the vehicle of Lord Siva). The infuriated demon king told the great minister Prahasta, these  profound words in a brief manner appropriate to the hour. \"Enquire from this wicked one, why he has come and from where, Why he destroyed the garden and for what purpose he threatened the demonesses? \"Enquire why this wicked one entered this inviolable city and for what purpose did he wage a war\" On hearing Ravana, Prahasta spoke these words boosting the monkey's morale 'O monkey Be relaxed. Feel safe. You need not entertain any fear. \"Have you came to the abode of Ravana sent by Indra? Speak the truth. Be not afraid.You will be released\". \"Your appearance is only of that of a vanara. But your glow is not of a vanara indeed. Tell the truth today. You will be set free. \"If you tell a lie, it will be difficult for you to live. Or else, tell me for what reason have you entered the abode of Ravana.' The foremost of the vanaras spoke to the lord of ogres in response to the equiries made to him: \"I have not come from Indra or Yama or Varuna. I have no friendship with Kubera. I have not been sent by Visnu. By birth I am vanara and I have come here.' The foremost of the vanaras spoke to the lord of ogres in response to the equiries made to him: \"I have not come from Indra or Yama or Varuna. I have no friendship with Kubera. I have not been sent by Visnu. By birth I am vanara and I have come here.' \"Desiring to fight with me the powerful ogres came. Then I fought in self defence. \"It is not possible to bind me with any bondage of astras even by devas or danavas. Such a boon has been granted to me by Grandfather Brahma. \"Wishing to see the king I honoured this astra and not otherwise. Even though I was tormented by the ogres and released by the astra I submitted to you as I have a small work assigned by the king. \"Wishing to see the king I honoured this astra and not otherwise. Even though I was tormented by the ogres and released by the astra I submitted to you as I have a small work assigned by the king. Know that I am a messenger of the highly powerful Rama.

                "Hanuman, the best of monkeys, looking at the very powerful Ravana spoke slowly  these highly meaningful words. \"O lord of demons I reached your realm here by the orders of Sugriva, lord of monkeys who is like your brother. He conveys his good wishes to you. \"The great Sugriva who is like your brother sends you a message pertinent to this world and the other world, that which is beneficial and consistent with righteousness and propriety ( and ). Listen: \"There was an emperor named Dasaratha richly endowed with chariots, horses and elephants. He was a friend to the world and was like a father and equal to Indra in splendour. \"His eldest son, a highly effulgent one, named Rama who was dear to the king, accepting his father's orders went into exile with brother Lakshmana and wife Sita also accepting a righteous path and entered Dandaka forest. \"His eldest son, a highly effulgent one, named Rama who was dear to the king, accepting his father's orders went into exile with brother Lakshmana and wife Sita also accepting a righteous path and entered Dandaka forest. \"Sita, daughter of king Janaka of Videha kingdom, loyally followed her husband, Rama. She was lost in the forest. \"Searching for the divine lady the prince reached mount Rshyamuka along with his brother and there he met Sugriva. \"Sugriva promised Rama to undertake search for Sita and Rama assured Sugriva of securing him the kingdom of the monkeys. \"Then prince Rama killed Vali in battle and made Sugriva, king of the vanaras and bears and restored the kingship of Sugriva. \"You know of Vali, chief of the vanaras, in the past. Rama killed him with a single arrow in the combat. \"Sugriva, who is true to his word and a faithful warrior, king of monkeys anxiously sent vanaras in all directions for searching Sita. \"Hundreds, thousands and unlimited number of monkeys are searching (for Sita) in all directions, in the underworld and heavens and the sky. \"Some of the very powerful heroes equal to Garuda, equal to the Windgod (in swiftness) have gone (in quest of Sita) without touching the earth. \"I, Maruta's son, Hanuman by name too came swiftly leaping across a hundred yojanas across the ocean searching for Sita. \"While I was roaming I saw Janaka's daughter Sita at your house.You are a knower of the truth of righteousness.

It is not proper to forfeit your own life in this way. \"You know you will not be killed by asuras or gods.

The tenheaded Ravana who was of matchless strength, hearing the unpleasant words of advice and warning expressed skilfully with dignity by the great Hanuman, enraged Ravana, his eyes rolling in anger ordered the execution of Hanuman.       Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the great vanara's speech, Ravana overwhelmed with anger ordered the execution of Hanuman. Vibhishana did not approve of the killing of Hanuman, who had declared that he was an envoy (of Sri Rama) when the wicked Ravana ordered his murder. Vibhishana who stood by the right course of action, having realised that the lord of demons was angry pondered over his duty. Then Vibhishana, who was skilled in speech having decided about his duty   addressed his reverential elder brother, a conqueror of enemies in soothing, words in a meaningful, wholesome manner. \"O king of ogres give up your wrath, forgive and calm down. Please listen to my appeal. You know the basic values of life. Virtuous rulers of the earth do not order killing of an envoy. \"Mighty king killing this Hanuman is contrary to righteousness of kings. This is deplorable diplomacy and also unbecoming of you. \"You are conversant with  dharma of a king.  You have a sense of gratitude. You are a knower of right and wrong of all beings. the supeme truth. \"If wise persons like you are also overpowered by unjust anger, then the mastery of  the scriptures will become a mere fruitless exercise. \"O destroyer of foes, O unassailable king of demon calm down. Only after carefully considering what is proper and improper decide on the punishment to be imposed\". Ravana, the lord of demons heard Vibhishana's words and overcome with anger replied: \"O slayer of foes it is not wrong to kill a sinner. I shall, therefore, kill the sinful vanara.\" On hearing his brother's harsh words spoken in tremendous anger, which were not acceptable to noble souls, wise Vibhishana again spoke these words of supreme truth: \"O lord of Lanka O king of demons be pleased to listen to my words which are the essence of dharma and artha. The elders have declared that the emissaries should not be killed by any means. This enemy has done a lot of harm, no doubt. Indeed he has done terrible and unpleasant deeds. (Yet) the wise have recommended many alternate punishments, while prohibiting their killing. \"Mutilation of limbs, flogging, shaving of the head, and deforming limbs etc. these punishments have been prescribed for an emissary. Never has killing of an emissary been heard. \"You are wellversed  in  dharma and artha. Learned men first decide what is right or wrong (before imposing punishment). How are you swayed by unjust anger? Indeed courageous persons (like you) should control anger. \"Heroic Ravana there is hardly any one who is equal to you in the knowledge of dharma, in the practice of worldly affairs and in grasping subtle truths of sastras. Indeed you are supreme among suras and asuras. \"You are the king of demons. Hosts of gods and daityas efficient in wars are conquered by you again and again since you are a brave warrior invincible to gods and demons. \"I do not see any use in killing this monkey. Pronounce  punishment on those who have sent this vanara. \"Whether he is soft or harsh, he has been sent by others. He is speaking on other's behalf and is dependent on them. An emissary does not deserve to be killed. \"O king If he is killed, I do not see any one who can cross this great ocean and come by air to reach this place. \"You who can conquer citadels of enemies should not direct your efforts to kill an envoy.You are fit to make efforts against enemies like gods including Indra. \"O lover of war if Hanuman is slain I do not see any one who can incite those two illmannered sons of the king who are prevented from reaching this faroff land. \"O delighter of demons even the gods and demons who are endowed with valour and energy cannot win you. You are invincible. It is not proper for you to lose chances of a good war. \"You have with you wellwishers, courageous ones, who have good qualities born in a good race, who are noble, sensible people, wielders of weapons and wellpaid warriors in crores. By your order let some strong soldiers from one contingency go and capture the two sons of the king, to exhibit your power over the enemy.",
                "The tenheaded Ravana heard his brother, the greatsoul Vibhishana's timely advice which was in keeping with the laws of the land and replied. \"Indeed, you have spoken very well.Killing of emissary is censured (in sastras). Surely we will impose suitable punishment other than killing. \"The tail is dear to the monkeys and it is an ornament for them. Set fire to it at once and let him go with his burning tail. \"Then all his friends, relatives and his kinsmen will see his disfigured and handicapped form. The demon king having ordered thus, the monkey was taken by the ogres round the junctions of the roads all over the city with his tail on fire. \"Then all his friends, relatives and his kinsmen will see his disfigured and handicapped form. The demon king having ordered thus, the monkey was taken by the ogres round the junctions of the roads all over the city with his tail on fire. \"Obeying the orders of the king, the brutally angry demons wrapped his tail with tatters of cotton. While the tail was being swathed, the great vanara grew in size like wild fire fed with dry firewood. The demons soaked the tail and set fire to it. His face burning in anger shone like the rising Sun and his mind seized with indignation, he struck them with the burning tail. All the demons including the shedemons and their children and the elders went out joyfully to see the burning tail of Hanuman. When the cruel demons collected together and bound him once again the heroic Hanuman thought what was appropriate to the moment. 'Even though these ogres are not capable, they have bound me. Indeed I will leap (into  the air) once again and sever my bonds and kill them. 'These  evilminded demons bind me, ordered by their lord. When I am moving here for the welfare of  my master, I will not let them escape 'I am strong enough to destroy all the demons in a battle. I am enduring this humiliation in order to make Rama happy. In this way I will get a chance to see Lanka once again. 'I am strong enough to destroy all the demons in a battle. I am enduring this humiliation in order to make Rama happy. In this way I will get a chance to see Lanka once again. 'Indeed I saw Lanka at night for which I could not acquire proper knowledge about the fortification of the city. Surely it should be seen by me now after the night has passed. 'Let the demons torture me freely by setting fire to my tail. Let them bind me. I am not exhausted. Then the ogres set forth joyfully capturing the very powerful elephant among the monkeys, the great vanara who had contracted his body. The cruel demons started blowing conches and beating drums. They paraded him in the city  announcing their deeds. Hanuman, the subduer of enemies ranged forth happily while he was followed by the demons in the great city. The great vanara saw wonderful, towering mansions, secure, mammoth buildings all over and welllaid out squares on the streets. The son of the Windgod saw the streets with beautiful, tall mansions and houses appearing like clouds, highways and byways and secret routes. All the demons went forth through cross roads, altars built on four pillars and royal roads announcing that he (Hanuman) was a spy. With eagerness to have a glance at Hanuman's blazing tail, women, children and the aged here and there came out of eagerness to see him. When the tip of Hanuman's tail was set on fire, the uglyeyed shedemon. Carried the unpleasant news to divine Sita. \"O Sita the redfaced monkey who conversed with you is being paraded in the streets with his tail set on fire\". Distressed on hearing the news which was as cruel as her own abduction Sita started burning with grief and invoked the firegod. Wishing the great monkey well, the largeeyed Sita invoked the Firegod in her heart. \"O Firegod if I have served my husband, if I have practised austerities, and if I am loyal to my husband, be cool to Hanuman. \"If wise Rama has some compassion for me, if there is any residue of good luck for me, to Hanuman be cool O Firegod. \"O Firegod if Rama is righteous, if I am pure in mind, and if I am longing to unite with him, be cool to Hanuman. \"If Sugriva is true to his promise to fight (for me), if he should be able to rescue me from this ocean of agony let Hanuman be cool (not consumed by fire.)\" Then the tips of the intense flame appeared steadily moving to the fawneyed Sita indicating the firegod's auspiciousness and safety to Hanuman. \"The Windgod accompanying Hanuman's firelit tail also blew cool like the wind from snow, to calm the mind of the divine lady. When the tail was burning, the vanara wondered how the fire ablaze on every side was not burning him: 'This huge flame is not hurting me. It  is as though a mass of ice is placed at the end of my tail. (The fire did not torture nor extend beyond the tip of my tail.) 'It must be due to the power of Rama, by which I found a wonderful mountain  emerging from the sea to give me protection while I was crossing the ocean. Now evidently this is due to Rama's power (that my tail is not burning me). 'If the anxiety of the ocean and the wise Mainaka mountain is to serve Rama what is it that the fire cannot do? 'Because of Sita's steadfast loyalty, Rama's power and my father's friendship with the Firegod, the fire is not burning me.' Once more a thought came to the great Hanuman,the elephant among monkeys. He sprang up and shouted loud. Then the illustrious Hanuman reached the entrance of the lofty city, which was  like the peak of a mountain and turned away the demons. From his mountainlike form he assumed his original small figure within a moment casting off the bonds. Illustrious Hanuman was relieved of the bond and once again grew to a mountain size. Looking around he saw an iron club near the archway. Seizing the black Iron club again, the strongarmed Hanuman killed all the demon guards. Hanuman, who was of fearsome valour in war with the demons, having killed them, gazed at Lanka once again. Garlanded by the flames of his tail around, he shone like the Sun covered with garlands of rays.       Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "With his objectives achieved, the monkey gazed at Lanka with growing zeal and pondered over the remaining work. 'Is there anything still left which can further torment the demons here? 'All the trees of the garden are broken, powerful demons have been killed, and a contingent of the army is destroyed. Only the destruction of the citadel is left. 'If the citadel is destroyed it would be a happy conclusion with a little effort. I can successfully complete my task. 'It would be proper to satiate this fire at the end of my tail  by offering it to these excellent mansions (I shall set fire to these houses). The great Hanuman, with his burning tail wandered on tops of the mansions of Lanka, which looked like clouds with lightning. The vanara moved from one house to the other, looking at the gardens and houses of the demons without fear. Powerful and brave Hanuman who was equal to the Windgod in speed jumped down on the house of Prahasta and set fire to it. From there he jumped on to Mahaparsva's house and set it ablaze. Hanuman appeared like the fireflame at the time of dissolution. Powerful and brave Hanuman who was equal to the Windgod in speed jumped down on the house of Prahasta and set fire to it. From there he jumped on to Mahaparsva's house and set it ablaze. Hanuman appeared like the fireflame at the time of dissolution. The great, brilliant vanara bounded on to Vajradamstra's, of Suka's and wise Sarana's. Thus Hanuman, the chief of the vanaras set fire to Indrajit's residence and then to Jambumali's and Sumali's building. The brilliant monkey leader bypassed Vibhishanas's house and avoiding it that way set fire to the mansions of other ogres, Rasmiketu, Suryasatru, Hrasvakarna, Vajradamshtra, Romasa, Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dhwajagriva, Vidyujjihva, Hastimukha, Karala, Pisacha, Sonitaksha, Kumbhakarna, Makaraksha, Yagnasatru, Brahmasatru, Naranthaka, Kumbha, and wicked Nikumbha.

Moving among those highly luxurious mansions the glorious Vanara burnt away the wealth of all the rich demons. Heroic and illustrious Hanuman, having crossed all the residences of the ogres finally reached the palace of Ravana, the king. Then Hanuman, the hero with the burning tail set fire to the chief palace of Ravana that resembled mountains Meru and Mandara, decorated with different kinds of gems and exquisite with several auspicious articles. While the flames were rising up, he roared like the thundering cloud at the time of dissolution. Then Hanuman, the hero with the burning tail set fire to the chief palace of Ravana that resembled mountains Meru and Mandara, decorated with different kinds of gems and exquisite with several auspicious articles. While the flames were rising up, he roared like the thundering cloud at the time of dissolution. The windgod's association made the fire spread at great speed. It appeared like fire at the time of dissolution. Combined with the wind the fire began to spread, burning the houses with great speed. The palatial structures with windows of golden meshwork, embedded with pearls and gems and other precious stones tumbled. Unable to protect their rich houses, and thoroughly disappointed the demons said, 'Alas, the Firegod came in the form of a vanara' A tumultuous sound arose. A few shedemons at once jumped out of their burning mansions surrounded by fire. They held their breastfeeding babies in their arms, their hair let loose shouting as they jumped. As they were alighting, they glowed like lightnings dropping from the clouds. A few shedemons at once jumped out of their burning mansions surrounded by fire. They held their breastfeeding babies in their arms, their hair let loose shouting as they jumped. As they were alighting, they glowed like lightnings dropping from the clouds. Hanuman saw many colourful molten minerals mixed with diamonds, corals vaiduryas, pearls and silver flowing (dropping) from every mansion. Just as fire is not satisfied with dry sticks and grass Hanuman was not satisfied with the dead demons. The flames of fire were shining like kimsuka flowers here, like salmali wood there, and like saffron flowers elsewhere. Hanuman, endowed with great speed, burnt Lanka just as Tripurari, or Rudra burnt theTripuras (three cities of gold, silver and iron). The fierce fire lit by Hanuman, the hero endowed with great speed, spread around in circles and shot up flying high to the top of the Trikuta mountain on which Lanka was located. Fanned by the wind, inflamed by the fat from the corpses of the demons, the fire spread in the mansions burning without smoke. It spread with great speed like the fire at the end of the universe. The highly radiant fire stood like a crore of Suns surrounding the entire Lanka. It was glowing, cracking like Indra's thunderbolt as though the whole universe was collapsing. The dazzling flames of fire red like kimsuka flowers shot up violently into the sky. The clouds engulfed by the smoke rising from the subsiding fire was shining like the lustre of blue lotuses . 'Is this the wielder of thunderbolt Indra, who is the king of gods? Is it Yama himself? Is It the Windgod, or Firegod, or Varuna or Rudra? Is it Kubera or Sun or Moon or is it the god of death himself? He cannot be a mere monkey, indeed. 'Or is it Grandfather Brahma, the supreme fourfaced god enraged and arrived in the form of vanara to kill the clan of demons? 'Can he be the vast boundless energy, the unthinkable and infinite lord Visnu assuming the monkeyform? Is he the peerless, unmanifest form beyond all imagination who has arrived here by virtue of his Maya (illusory power) in order to destroy the demons'? All eminent demons having collected together, quickly surveyed the situation.Seeing the burnt city, with  all its living creatures, houses and trees consigned to the flames, they spoke to one another. Lanka with its chariots horses, elephants, flocks of birds, animals and trees burnt all of a sudden, the ogres cried loudly and piteously. \"O father dear O son O my dear O friend alas, the life which is enjoyable, sacred and prosperous is destroyed in this way\". Saying this, the demons cried out dreadfully and loudly. With the Fire god spreading flames all over, heroes dead, retreating troops shattered by Hanuman's anger, Lanka appeared as though it was cursed. Highly sensitive Hanuman saw the city of Lanka filled with perplexed, scared and sorrowful demons, Lanka succumbed to the flames of firegod and looked as if it was  hit by the anger of Brahma, the selfborn god. Hanuman, son of the Windgod stood at ease having shattered the garden that was full of excellent trees, and killed the demons and burnt down rows of beautiful houses in the city. Standing on the peak of Trikuta mountain with his tail burning like the aura of the Sun, the lion among vanaras looked resplendent like the Sun surrounded by his rays. Great Hanuman, sought Rama's presence in his mind after killing many demons, breaking down many trees of the garden, and setting fire to the mansions of demons. All the gods praised the vanara chief, son of the Windgod, who was powerful, wise and efficient and had the speed of the Wind. Hanuman destroyed the garden, killed the demons, burnt the city of Lanka and was shining with delight The gandharvas, gods, siddhas and great sages were amazed at seeing the burning city of Lanka All beings were afraid of Hanuman thinking that he was the fatal fire, consuming worlds at the hour of dissolution . All gods, great sages, gandharvas, vidyadharas, nagas and yakshas and all great beings experienced supreme joy.       Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Powerful Hanuman, having burnt the entire city of Lanka, put out the fire on his tail in the ocean. Beholding the burning city, the destroyed gardens and the panic stricken ogres, he began to think: Overtaken by great fear, Hanuman felt a sense of selfreproach seeing Lanka reduced to ashes, and said, ' Lanka is burnt. What a heinous action has been perpetrated by me'. 'Blessed indeed are the highsouled men, who in their wisdom restrain their own anger as one would put off  burning fire with water. 'Which sinful act an angry man will not commit? He will even kill his respectable elders or insult sages with his harsh tongue. 'An angry person knows not what he should utter and what he should not. No act appears wrong for an angry man. Nothing is unutterable for him at any time, anywhere. 'A man who drives away his rising anger with tolerance just as a snake casts off its slough is alone called a truly wise man. 'Fie upon me, a wicked, shameless person and the greatest sinner for betraying the  master and setting fire to the city without thinking of Sita. 'If this Lanka is burnt, even noble Janaki is burnt, my master's work is spoilt by me unknowingly. 'My very mission is foiled. Sita has not been protected by me for no part of Lanka has escaped unburnt. 'A small work is done, no doubt. But the very root of my achievement has been destroyed in my anger. 'Surely Janaki has perished in Lanka, for not even a little place is left unburnt. The entire city is reduced to ashes. 'If my work has been destroyed by my perversity of judgement, I will give up my life now  and here itself'. 'Shall I end my life by jumping into fire just now, or else into the mouth of submarine fire? Should I offer my body to the living creatures of the ocean as their food? 'Having spoilt the entire work how can I show my face to the king of monkeys? How is it possible to see both the tigers among men? 'On account of my mistake of yielding to anger, I have exhibited the unstable monkeynature and made it well established in the three worlds. 'Fie upon my hasty action commited due to lack of selfcontrol. I did not save Sita eventhough the entire situation was under my control. (I had the  capacity to save her. But I failed due to anger.) 'If the two princes know about Sita's loss they will die and when they are dead Sugriva would perish along with all his relatives. 'How will the loving righteous brother, Bharata along with Satrughna survive after hearing this? 'When the righteous Ikshvaku race perishes the people would be tormented by grief and remorse. There is no doubt. 'I have failed in seeking dharma and artha. It is evident is that I am a destroyer of the world because I was overtaken by anger. How unfortunate I am' When Hanuman was thus bemoaning, good omens as in the past appeared before him. He started reflecting once again: 'On the other hand a beautiful and auspicious lady like Sita will be protected by her own splendour and will not perish as fire cannot extinguish fire. (Sita is pure like fire. Here the great sage Valmiki is suggesting the future incident in which Sita emerged safe from 'Agnipariksha' or fireordeal.) 'Fire cannot touch that lady who is protected by her own chastity and who is wedded to the righteous man of immasureable glory. 'Fire, the consumer of oblations who has the property of burning has not burnt me and this is surely on account of Rama's power and Vaidehi's merits. 'To Bharata, Lakshmana and Satrughna she is a goddess and she is dear to Rama's heart, how would she perish? 'If not so, the firegod who never fails in burning has not burnt my tail. How will he burn noble Sita?' Then Hanuman thought of the appearance of mountain Hiranyanabha in the midst of water, a wonderful phenomenon. 'By virtue of her power of asceticism, power of truthfulness and exclusive devotion towards her husband, she may consume the fire. Fire will not burn her'. As Hanuman was thinking so, he heard the words of the great charanas who were praising the queen's power of righteousness. 'Oh Hanuman has indeed accomplished the marvellous task of spreading the terrific fire on the demons buildings. The city is crowded with women, children and old demons running (in a bid to save themselves). The loud wails of demons resounded in the mountaincaves. It was as if the city was shrieking loudly. 'The city with its towering markets, ramparts and portals is burnt, but Janaki is not. It is really wonderful, strange With omens that proved to be right and for good reasons and from the words of the sages (charanas), Hanuman felt happy. Hanuman, having fulfilled his desires and knowing that Sita is not hurt, thought of departing after meeting Sita once again (to testify that she is really safe).       Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Sundarakanda  of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Hanuman offered salutations to Janaki, stationed at the foot of the simsupa tree, and said, \"Luckily I see you unscathed.\" Looking at Hanuman again and again, as he was ready to start on his return journey, thus spoke Sita expressing her love for her husband: \"O destroyer of foes, you are capable of rescuing me singlehanded. Your success will  raise your strength and bring glory. \"If Kakutstha Rama, the slayer of enemy forces comes to Lanka, fills it with his arrows and takes me back, it will be worthy of him. \"You should act in such a manner that the exalted Rama, who is chivalrous in the battlefield, exhibits his valour worthy of his stature\". Hearing her meaningful reply which was welldisposed and reasonable, Hanuman replied: \"Rama will come soon with the best of vanaras and bears. He would win the battle and remove your sorrrow. Hanuman, son of the Windgod having consoled Vaidehi, saluted her respectfully and decided to depart. Then Hanuman, the crusher of enemies, a tiger among vanaras anxious to see his lord ascended the mount Arishta. Mount Arishta was full of blue forestranges with choicest tall padmaka trees. With clouds hanging on the slopes of mountain peaks, it appeared as though the mountain was wrapped in an upper garment. As if the mountain was awakened from sleep by the rays of the blessed Sun. With the colour of glowing minerals exuding, it was as if the mountain was looking out with his eyes open. (The minerals underneath the mud appear when wind blows removing the dust covering them. The glowing minerals are fancied to be eyes of the mountain.) With the loud sounds of masses of gurgling waters, the mountain appeared as though it was standing and reciting (the Vedas) loudly. With murmuring sounds of different waterfalls, it appeared as though the mountain was singing. (The sage differentiates the steadily trickling watersound from the rhythmic musical sounds of waterfalls.) With the tall devadaru trees on the mountain, it appeared as if the sages were standing with shoulders lifted up and performing penance. The sounds of waterfalls filled all over with reverberations. The mountain appeared as if trembling with the dark clouds of autumn. The shrill sounds pasing through the hollow bamboos filled with air appeared as if it was producing sweet musical notes. The mountain was as though hissing like a dreadful, poisonous snake. With the caves standing majestically covered with mist, the mountain appeared as if it was meditating. With the ranges of foothills appearing like the feet of clouds traversing, with its peaks like garlands of clouds traversing over the mountain, it made one feel it was yawning. With many kinds of caves and peaks scattered all over, the mountain looked delightful. It was canopied with numerous trees like Sal, palms, Aswakarnas and bamboos. It was spread with creepers filled with beautiful flowers and herds of animals. The colourful minerals flowing down decorated the mountain. There were many streams of water flowing and rocks making it difficult for the streams to flow. The mountain was inhabited by sages, yakshas, gandharvas, kinnaras and nagas, and uragas. The clusters of creepers, and trees bearing tasty fruits and roots were uprooted. There were caves inhabited by lions. Herds of tigers were scattered all over (by the impetus of Hanuman's pressure on the mountain). Anxious to see Rama soon, the son of the Windgod ascended the mountain happily. Crushed under Hanuman's feet the rocks making a loud noise on the beautiful mountain ranges rolled down, reduced to powder. On ascending the king of mountains, desiring to reach the northern shore of the saltwater ocean from the Southern shore, he enlarged his body (in preparation to leap). Then the heroic son of the Windgod, who had ascended the mountain saw the dreadful ocean inhabited by fishes and snakes. Hanuman, the tiger among monkeys leaped into the sky like the Windgod from the south to the north shore. Pressed under the feet of Hanuman, the great mountain made loud sound sinking into the earth along with all its creatures, with its shaken mountain peaks and uprooted trees dropping down. Shaken by the violent force of Hanuman's thighs, the blossoming trees fell on the ground like sickmen hit by Indra's thunderbolt. The dreadful roar of strong lions, lying in mountaincaves was heard cracking the sky when they were crushed in the turmoil. The Vidyadharis with their clothes slipped and ornaments disarrayed in fear, at once flew from the mountain. Highly powerful, huge and poisonous snakes with their glowing tongues protruded, pressed on their heads and necks (by Hanuman). Then the kinnaras, uragas, gandhravas, yakshas and vidyadharas left the tortured mountain and occupied the sky. Crushed by the powerful Hanuman, that prosperous mountain with its trees standing and tall peaks sank into the underworld. That mountain of ten yojanas in width and thirty yojanas in height got levelled with the earth. Eager to leap the terrific ocean lashed by huge waves hitting the shore Hanuman rose up effortlessly and jumped into the sky.       Thus ends the  fiftysixth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hanuman leaped ike the Windgod, unwearied across the sky, as a huge boat crosses an ocean. The ocean was graced with a swan, the sky with constellation of Swati with fullblown lotuses and water lilies, like the nagas, yakshas, and gandharvas gathered together. The Moon in the sky was like a white lotus, the Sun like a waterfowl, the auspicious Tishya and Shravana like the sweetvoiced swans, and the clouds like duckweeds and green grassy spots on the shore.

Great Hanuman, son of the Windgod, flew through the abode of the Windgod as if he was swallowing the space, scratching the  Moon, lord of the stars, as if seizing the heavens along with the constellation of Sun and stars and as though he was drawing the clusters of clouds. (In contact with Hanuman) the clouds shone forth brilliantly in white and black, in blue and yellow and in greenish red colour. With his exist and entrances into the mass of clouds, his appearances and disappearances among the clouds, he looked like the Moon. Passing through the clouds, appearing and disappearing, the heroic Hanuman clad in white was like the Moon in the white sky. As he made his way through flakes of clouds, again and again appearing and disappearing, Hanuman the delight of the Windgod shone in the sky roaring like a thundering cloud. He looked like Garuda. The glorious Hanuman, having killed eminent ogres and thereby making himself widely known, having caused havoc to the city of Lanka and  terrific sorrow to Ravana by tormenting the army, offered salutations to Vaidehi from midocean and continued his journey. The glorious Hanuman, having killed eminent ogres and thereby making himself widely known, having caused havoc to the city of Lanka and  terrific sorrow to Ravana by tormenting the army, offered salutations to Vaidehi from midocean and continued his journey. The valiant Hanuman touched the lord of mountains fondly and went with great speed just as an arrow released from the centre of a powerful bowstring. The chief of the monkeys arrived near, and beholding the face of the Mahendra mountain, which resembled a mass of clouds, thundered. The thundering noise of Hanuman filled all the ten directions with great sound. Having sighted the place of his companions and waiting to see them for long that tiger among monkeys made a loud noise and shook his tail in joy. By the terrific sounds made by Hanuman in joy, it seemed as though the pathway of Garuda, the sky along with the Sun's orbit was splitting. Thereafter the brave and powerful monkeys waiting on the northern shore of the ocean for the arrival of the son of the Windgod, heard the roar and thundering sound of the stormy cloud produced by the sweeping motion of Hanuman's thighs propelled by the speed of his movement. Thereafter the brave and powerful monkeys waiting on the northern shore of the ocean for the arrival of the son of the Windgod, heard the roar and thundering sound of the stormy cloud produced by the sweeping motion of Hanuman's thighs propelled by the speed of his movement. All the vanaras who were feeling dejected and waiting anxiously heard the noise of Hanuman that sounded like a thundering cloud. On hearing the loud voice of Hanuman, all the vanaras were longing to see their friend. Jambavan the chief of vanaras became very happy at heart and called all the vanaras and spoke: \"Oh Hanuman is always successful. If he has not, he would not make sounds in this manner\". Hearing the sound of his dashing movements of arms and thighs the vanaras jumped about in joy, then and there. The vanaras were very happy. Longing to see Hanuman, they jumped from one tree top to another and from one peak of a mountain to the other. Waiting for Hanuman, the vanaras jumped from the tree tops holding the branches. They shook the branches just like clothes to welcome friends. Hanuman, the powerful son of the Windgod roared like the wind captured in a mountain cave would. (On seeing) Hanuman, who was resembling a heavy cloud approaching, the vanaras stood with folded hands. Thereafter the vanara, who resembled a mountain, descended with great speed on the summit of mount Mahendra full of trees. Overwhelmed with immeasurable joy, Hanuman descended from the sky like the mountain with its wings cut off and dropped on the bank of a mountain stream. Feeling very happy at heart all the vanara leaders gathered around Hanuman. They  stood motionless with extreme happiness. Feeling very happy at heart all the vanara leaders gathered around Hanuman. They  stood motionless with extreme happiness. The vanaras were filled with joy seeing Hanuman who returned unhurt. They offered roots and fruits to him. Hanuman on his part offered salutations to the foremost of the monkeys. The great Hanuman also offered salutations to elders, preceptors such as Jambavan and other leaders. He also saluted the young Angada. The valiant Hanuman worthy of worship having been honoured by both Jambavan and Angada was pleased. He responded briefly, saying 'Saw Sita'. Then holding the hand of Vali's son he sat down at a beautiful location of the garden of mountain Mahendra. Hanuman felt happy and told Angada, the bull of vanaras, \"I saw Sita in the groves of Ashoka guarded by dreadful ogres. She is blameless, eager to see Rama. She is wearing a single braid of hair. She is young and emaciated due to fasting. Her hair is matted and soiled\". Hanuman felt happy and told Angada, the bull of vanaras, \"I saw Sita in the groves of Ashoka guarded by dreadful ogres. She is blameless, eager to see Rama. She is wearing a single braid of hair. She is young and emaciated due to fasting. Her hair is matted and soiled\".

She is young and emaciated due to fasting. Her hair is matted and soiled\". Then hearing Hanuman's meaningful and nectarlike words all the vanaras rejoiced. Some powerful vanaras howled, some chattered, some roared and some screamed, going round and round and others echoed the sounds. Some elephantlike vanaras who were excited and felt overjoyed lifted their long and beautiful tails and hit them on the ground. A few vanaras jumped down from the mountain top and hugged the elephantlike Hanuman. And hearing Hanuman's sweetest words, Angada addressed the heroic vanaras \"O vanara you have leaped such a wide ocean and have returned. In strength and valour. There is none equal to you. \"O your devotion to the king, O your valour, fortitude  and courage is admirable. You could see Rama's wife, an illustrious lady. This is a matter of our good luck. Rama will (now) shed the sorrow due to separation from Sita. Then the vanaras went round all the three Angada, Hanuman and Jambavan. Out of joy they lay down on the huge rocks. All the vanaras longing to listen to Hanuman about his crossing the ocean, seeing Lanka, Sita and Ravana kept looking at the face of Hanuman. All the vanaras longing to listen to Hanuman about his crossing the ocean, seeing Lanka, Sita and Ravana kept looking at the face of Hanuman. Surrounded by many great vanaras, Angada was shining like Indra, lord of the gods attended by the gods in heaven. The mountain peak graced by famous Hanuman and renowned Angada bedecked with armlets seated on top joyfully, appeared prosperous and splendid.       Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then the mighty Hanuman and other vanaras having assembled on the summit of mountain Mahendra and felt vey much happy. Thereafter, very delighted Jambavan inquired Hanuman most affectionately of all that happened. \"How did you find the godlike lady? How was she? How was the tenheaded one, cruel in action, behaving with her? You may narrate what she said. \"O Hanuman, tell us in detail  the entire thing. On hearing it, we will think about the next course of action. \"You are wise and you should tell us in detail what is to be told and what has to be hidden when we report.\" Having been asked (by Jambavan and others) Hanuman with horripilations all over his body, bowed down and saluted in the direction of queen Sita and began: \"I rose upwards leaping into the sky, intent on reaching the southern shore from the mountain Mahendra.It has been witnessed directly by all of you. \"Even as I was leaping I saw a terrific and wonderful golden peak which came as if to obstruct me on my path. \"The mountain stood on my way turning towards me in order to obstruct me. Then I resolved in my mind that this great, wonderful, golden mountain has to be smashed. \"Hit by my tail the great mountain peak, which was radiating like the Sun was shattered into a thousand pieces. \"Perceiving that I am going to smash him he spoke to me in a sweet tone delighting my heart, addressing me like a son. 'Know me to be a friend of windgod and so I am like your father's brother. I am dwelling in this great ocean and known as Mainaka. 'O son in the past, foremost of the mountains too had wings and they used to range  at will all over the earth tormenting all. 'Mahendra, the killer of ogre Paka, heard the story (of the cruel deeds) of mountains and cut off their wings into a thousand pieces with his thunderbolt. 'O son I was saved from Indra by your kind father Maruta who dropped me in this great  ocean. 'O subduer of enemiesI must make efforts to help Rama the foremost among the righteous, for I have received help (from your father) who is equal to Indra in valour'. \"When I heard Mainaka, I told him about my intention to go up. That great self Mainaka allowed me. \"When I heard Mainaka, I told him about my intention to go up.

It took a long time to cross the ocean. \"I saw Surasa, the mother of serpents in the midst of the ocean and she said: 'O powerful monkey you are destined to be my food provided by the immortals. Therefore, I will eat you as I have I found you after a long time.

'His wife was abducted by the evilminded Ravana. By Rama's command I am going to meet her as messenger from Rama.' \"I told her that it is proper for her (living in the domain of Rama) to help his queen and wife. Or else, I promised after I disclose to Rama, Sita's whereabouts, I will come and enter her mouth. \"When Surasa said this I who was ten yojanas in height increased  by fifteen yojanas. \"She too opened her mouth wide enough for my size.

Steadfast she uttered these ominous words to me: 'O huge monkey where are you going? I am hungry since long. I am going without food and must eat you. Make me satisfied'. \"I said 'well' and enlarged my body more than her mouth could hold. \"She opened her huge mouth to eat me as she did not know that I had already assumed a huge ugly form on my own. \"In a moment I reduced from a huge form to a small one, entered her heart and sprang into the sky. \"She who resembled a mountain fell into the ocean with her arms hanging down when I pulled out her heart. \"I heard the charanas and siddhas residing in the sky talking to each other that the fierce ogres Simhika has been killed by Hanuman in a moment. \"Having slained Simhika, I thought of the huge feat that I have done. I remembered the big mission before me and went to the southern shore of the ocean and saw Lanka full of trees. \"Then the frightening form, with its hair burning like sacrificial fire, emerged to kill me.

The Madhuvanam of Sugriva was wellprotected  and was difficult to access for the vanaras. It was enchating to all beings. Dadhimukha, the foremost of all monkeys, of great valour and the maternal uncle of Sugriva was the caretaker of  the garden. On reaching the vanara king's extensive, delightful garden all the vanaras highly rejoiced. The honeycoloured monkeys felt happy on seeing the Madhuvanam and sought Angada's permission to drink honey. Young Angada asked old Jambavan's permission for the vanaras to drink honey and Jambavan permitted them. Permitted thus to drink honey the forestdwelling monkeys were motivated. They rejoiced very happily and started dancing. Some sang, some prostrated on the ground, some danced, while some laughed, some jumped from the tree, some roamed about and some jumped up and down. While some supported one another, some held each other, some exchanged secrets with one another, some entertained one another. While some ran from one tree to another, some jumped down from broken branches, and some swiftfooted ones fell down from the top of trees. While one was singing, others approached him laughing while some were laughing others fell on them laughing excessively. While some were roaring, others went pushing them down. While some were encouraged to do something others shouted at them. The army of monkeys had lost control over their bodies due to drinking of honeywine. Not even one was quietly seated there. Not even one was not intoxicated. Not only that, none were satisfied. Beholding the destruction wrought by the vanaras to the garden, trees, leaves and flowers, and having drunk all the honey, Dadhimukha angrily asked them to stop and get out. The elderly Dadhimukha who was the powerful protector of the garden reprimanded them and devised yet again a plan to protect it. He spoke harshly to some, to others he asked not to talk, some he slapped on the hind part with the palm of his hand. To some he spoke pleasantly and with some he quarrelled. And to others he spoke in a conciliatory manner. In their drunkenness they were using abusive language and with their strength they retaliated without fear. They invaded without considering their mistakes. They caught hold of Dadhimukha and pulled him. In their drunkenness some monkeys scratched Dadhimukha violently with their nails, some bit him with their teeth and others slapped and kicked him with their palms and legs.Getting together they looted the garden completely.

Pleased with Hanuman's words, the distinguished Angada permitted the monkeys to drink. Even if Hanuman, the achiever, forbids me to do something, I will do it. And now when he has permitted you, why hesitate ? Having heard the words that came from Angada's mouth, the bulls among vanaras praised him for his generous approval. The vanaras praised Angada, the bull among vanaras and went to Madhuvanam swiftly like a fastflowing river going to uproot a tree. Overjoyed at the news of Mythili, being seen, the vanaras entered Madhuvanam and attacked the guards violently, drank the honey and ate the tasty fruits. Overjoyed at the news of Mythili, being seen, the vanaras entered Madhuvanam and attacked the guards violently, drank the honey and ate the tasty fruits. All the vanaras collected together, entered the Madhuvanam and attacked in many ways the guards protecting  the  garden. All of them now gathered at one place and drank honey from large containers. Others were busy preventing the guards. The honeycoloured monkeys drank honey. Some threw large chunks of honey combs after drinking and some went about intoxicated. Some took branches of trees and rested at the root of trees. Some totally languid lay down spreading leaves due to drinking of sweet drinks. Intoxicated with drink, some behaved like mad people, some pushed others senselessly and some were unsteady and shaky. Some roared, some warbled happily, some felt drowsy, drinking honey and some dropped off to sleep on the ground. Some made others laugh, some provoked others and some thought of doing something else having got over the intoxication. All the guards engaged in protecting the garden were driven away in all directions by the fierce vanaras. Some were dragged on their knees and tossed up. Some monkeys exhibited their private parts, showing indecent behaviour. Dadhimukha, highly disturbed at this, said: Permitted by Hanuman (to enter Madhuvanam and drink), they dragged one another forcefully tossed up  on their knees showing their private parts. Then Dadhimukha, the guardian of the garden became furious on the vanaras. Having heard from the guards that the garden was destroyed, he said soothing words to them. \"Come, we will all go there to Madhuvanam and prevent forcibly the vanaras who have consumed honey proud of their power. \"The heroes, bulls among vanaras, heard Dadhimukha and quickly entered Madhuvanam along with him. On the way, the energetic Dadhimukha took up a tree and ran to the leaping vanaras swiftly with guards following him. The furious vanara guards lifted rocks, trees and even mountains and went behind Dadhimukha the elephant among the vanaras. The heroic vanaras held Sala and Tala trees and rushed at once keeping their leader's words in mind. Then the heroic guards in their thousands fell on the vanaras proud of their power on and under the tala trees. Having seen the fury of Dadhimukha, Hanuman the leader of the vanaras went to him swiftly. Seeing the revered, powerful and strongarmed Dadhimukha rushing to him, the angry Angada caught him with both hands tightly. \"Blinded by arrogance, the prince pushed him (Dadhimukha) on the floor forcibly,  forgetting that he was his revered granduncle. The heroic Dadhimukha, an elephant among monkeys, with his shoulders and arms broken, and body drenched in blood lost his consciousness instantly. At once Dadhimukha, the maternal uncle of the king became conscious and chased with a stick the intoxicated vanaras. Escaping from the vanaras with great difficulty, Dadhimukha,  a bull among monkeys, repaired to a secluded place and said to his servants: \"Let them stay here. Our broadnecked king Sugriva will be there with Rama. Let us go to him. 'Madhuvan has come down to us from our forefather's time. Dear to the king, its entry is prohibited even to the gods. 'Sugriva will chase all the vanaras and their friends greedy for honey. They will be punished with a stick. They are doomed'. 'Indeed those evilminded ones who have disobeyed the king's order deserve to be killed.That way our fury and forbearance will result in success'. Powerful Dadhimukha having said that to the guardians of the garden rose up to the sky and went off with them. In a moment, Dadhimukha reached the place where wise Sugriva, the son of Sungod was there Seeing Rama, Lakshmana and also Sugriva from the sky he landed on an even ground. Dadhimukha, a great hero and king of the guards protecting Madhuvanam surrounded by his servants, with a sad expression on his face offered painful obeisance with folded hands bowing down his forehead at the feet of Sugriva.       Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Feeling anxious on seeing Dadhimukha touching his feet with his forehead, Sugriva, the bull among vanaras said: \"O heroic Dadhimukha, get up. Tell me why you have fallen at my feet. I give you protection from all. When great Sugriva gave assurance to wise Dadhimukha, he got up and said: \"O king in your time or even before, during the time of Vali, that (Madhuvanam) was forbidden for entry. Now it has been laid waste by the trespassing vanaras. \"Even though the garden guards forcibly tried to prevent them they did not care and have devoured all the honey. \"Some have thrown off the leftovers, when others were prevented from drinking off the honey, they raised their eyebrows (to show their grouch). \"When the guards asked the vanaras to leave the garden the enraged vanaras misbehaved with them. \"O Sugriva the vanara guards were chased away by the many heroic monkeys, angry and redeyed. \"Some were struck with hands, some beaten on their knees and were dragged as they liked and showed up their private parts. These heroes struck that way devoured the Madhuvanam on the earth at their will and devoured the honey even when you are there as king. While Dadhimukha appealed thus to wise Sugriva, Lakshmana the killer of enemies happened to see them and enquired: \"O king why has this protector of the garden come here? Why is he sad? What is he narrating, asked Lakshmana. Great prince Lakshmana thus said, Sugriva the proficient speaker replied: 'O venerable Lakshmana Dadhimukha as complaining that the fruits and honey have been consumed by the vanara heroes, Angada and others who have come after their search for Sita in the southern direction. \"Those vanaras having entered Madhuvanam and broken the trees are quite right. Had they not accomplished their purpose they would not have indulged themselves that way. \"Those vanaras having entered Madhuvanam and broken the trees are quite right. Had they not accomplished their purpose they would not have indulged themselves that way. \"If they have trespassed into the garden that way, they might have done their duty. No doubt, Hanuman alone among them might have seen Sita. \"Hanuman alone has the ability to do it, the reason being he has the capacity the wisdom, streneous effort, virility and enthusiasm to accomplish it. These attributes are wellestablished in him. Where Jambavan, Angada and Hanuman are leaders directing the task of the army it must have been accomplished. \"Here is Dadhimukha, a vanara, known for his valour and sweet tongue. He came here this incident to tell. \"O strongarmed Saumitri the Vanaras must have seen Sita. Or else, they would not have arrived to drink honey. \"If the renowned vanaras had not seen Vaidehi, they would not have entered the wonderful garden granted as boon (by Brahma). \"Then righteous Rama and Lakshmana rejoiced to hear the words of Sugriva, which were pleasing to the ears. \"Then righteous Rama and Lakshmana rejoiced to hear the words of Sugriva, which were pleasing to the ears. Beautifulnecked Sugriva heard Dadhimukha, the protector of the garden, felt very glad and replied: \"They went to the garden to drink only after having performed their duty. I am glad about it. Since they have accomplished the purpose, they are to be excused for their behaviour. I have pardoned them. \"Beholding young Rama and Lakshmana extremely delighted, their eyes filled with joy out of fulfilment of the purpose, Sugriva who was also highly delighted felt an auspicious thrill on his limbs and knew that good time had come.       Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Pleased with Sugriva's command (to send forth Angada and Hanuman) Dadhimukha offered salutations to Sugriva, Rama  and Lakshmana. Dadhimukha offered his obeisance to Sugriva and the mighty Rama and Lakshmana  and rose up to the sky followed by the vanaras. Descending into Madhuvanam, Dadhimukha saw all the monkey troops free from intoxication (of honeywine). Descending into Madhuvanam, Dadhimukha saw all the monkey troops free from intoxication (of honeywine). Heroic Dadhimukha went to Angada, holding his cupped palms reverentially and spoke these conciliatory words with joy: \"O handsome one, do not react harshly at these guards who have obstructed your companions out of ignorance and fury. \"O mighty Angada you are heir apparent and also king. Out of foolishness I obstructed you. You ought to pardon me this mistake. \"O blameless prince I have already told your father's elder brother and all the forestdwellers about your arrival here. \"He was not angry at your destruction of the garden. On the other hand, he was very glad to hear about your arrival. \"Your father's brother, Sugriva, the lord of vanaras felt very glad and indeed asked me to send you quickly.\" At these good words from Dadhimukha, Angada, the monkey leader, an eloquent speaker said this:. \"O scorcher of enemies I presume Rama has already heard the news of our arrival on accomplishment of the task. Hence it is not proper for us to tarry here. \"The vanaras of the forest have taken rest after drinking as much honey as they desired. What is left here to do? We have to go wherever Sugriva is.\" Angada said to the vanara troops assembled, \"Tell me what we have to do. I shall act as you wish. \"Even though I am heir apparent, it is not proper for me to order you.You have accomplished the purpose and to command you is not befitting on my part.\" On hearing Angada's valuable words said in that way, the vanaras repled: \"O king O bull among monkeys we think you are an exception to those to whom prosperity brings arrogance. \"You alone could speak such words. Your humility speaks of your fitness for a  bright future. \"O Angada the best of vanaras without your command none will find it possible to put forward even a single step.\" Thus addressed by all the vanaras, Angada said 'Well, let us go'. Then the powerful vanaras rose up the sky. All the vanara troops sprang up into the air as though there was no sky, like stones shattered by machines from the  mountains rise up. The swift monkeys roared aloud as though they went up the sky like thundering clouds driven by  the wind. Seeing the griefstricken, lotuseyed Rama, the lord of the vanaras Sugriva said this before the arrival of Angada: \"Trust me, Rama. Be blessed. The vanaras have seen the divine lady. There is no doubt. It is not possible for them to come here after exceeding the time limit  (in their search for Sita). \"My heir apparent, the strongarmed Angada, and the best of the monkeys is endowed with virtues. He would not come near me if his mission had failed. \"In case the vanaras have returned without accomplishing the task, Angada would have assumed a pathetic face, perplexed and unsteady in mind. \"If Angada, lord of the vanaras had not been happy, he would not have destroyed the Madhuvanam of my father's and my grandfather's time. O Rama, follower of righteous practices, Kausalya has an excellent son in you. Trust me. \"Hanuman is the one who has accomplished this task. Who else can? No doubt, he has seen Sita. \"O Rama, the best among the wise just like the luminosity that abides in the Sun, capacity to succeed, energy, intelligence, even courage and steadfastness reside in Hanuman. \"Where Jambavan is the leader, Angada the commander of the army and Hanuman the guiding force, the end result will not be otherwise. \"You are extremely valiant and it is unbecoming of you to be anxious at this time Rama. Just then chatterings of the monkeys were heard from the sky as they roared in pride talking of Hanuman's achievement. Having successfully completed the errand, they have arrived at Kishkinda. \"You are extremely valiant and it is unbecoming of you to be anxious at this time Rama. Just then chatterings of the monkeys were heard from the sky as they roared in pride talking of Hanuman's achievement. Having successfully completed the errand, they have arrived at Kishkinda. The great Sugriva heard the roar of the monkeys and was extremely happy. He kept raising and shaking his long tail in joy. The joyful monkeys with Angada and Hanuman leading them descended with eagerness to have a close look at Rama. Angada the chief along with the heroic monkeys very joyfully and exuberantly descended close to Sugriva, the king of monkeys and Rama. Then the strongarmed Hanuman with his head bowed down offered salutations and reported, 'Divine lady Sita with her constant devotion to Sri Rama is sound in body'. On hearing the nectarlike words from Hanuman that Sita was found, Rama and Lakshmana were delighted. Sugriva and Lakshmana glanced at Hanuman respectfully with affection thinking surely Hanuman alone has succeeded.",
                "Thereafter the vanaras arrived at the Prasrvana mount, with wonderful forests and bowed down to Sri Rama and mighty Lakshaman and Sugriva placing their leader, heir apparent in front. Then they began telling the story of Sita and her state. Thereafter the vanaras arrived at the Prasrvana mount, with wonderful forests and bowed down to Sri Rama and mighty Lakshaman and Sugriva placing their leader, heir apparent in front. Then they began telling the story of Sita and her state. The monkeys in Rama's presence narrated all about Sita's detention in Ravana's Ashoka garden, the ogresses threatening her and the time limit fixed by Ravana (for her survival). Hearing of Sita alive and not harmed, Rama asked the vanaras, 'How is Sita? How is she disposed to me? Tell me everything'. Hearing of Sita alive and not harmed, Rama asked the vanaras, 'How is Sita? How is she disposed to me? Tell me everything'. On hearing the words from Rama, the vanaras requested Hanuman who was aware of  Sita's position to tell Rama all about her. The son of the Wind god, Hanuman who was wise in speech heard the words of Rama, offered salutations to Sita in the direction in which she was located and narrated the story about her discovery. \"Having crossed the sea consisting of a hundred yojanas in quest of Vaidehi, I found her. \"On the southern shore of the ocean is situated the city of Lanka , ruled by the evilminded Ravana. \"There in the inner palace of Ravana, I saw your lovely wife Sita, with all her hopes pinned on you, giving up all other desires. \"I found her in the beautiful garden guarded by hideous ogresses threatening her again and again \"Sita, who did not deserve and yet was full of grief was detained by Ravana in his inner palace, guarded by ogresses. She had single braid (a sign of desolation), was pathetic,  and totally absorbed in your thought. She was lying on bare ground with her limbs turned pale, like lotus in winter. She was averse to Ravana and was determined to commit suicide. She has only Rama in her mind. Somehow I found her. \"Sita, who did not deserve and yet was full of grief was detained by Ravana in his inner palace, guarded by ogresses.

(She said)'O son of the Windgod you should let Rama, the tiger among men know all that you have seen here. 'Within hearing of Sugriva, tell him about your efforts. Present this(signet) to Rama carefully preserved by me. 'This auspicious (jewel) Chudamani has been preserved by me very carefully.

'O Son of Dasaratha I will hold on to life for a month. Captured by the demons, I will not live for more than a month'. \"With her limbs emaciated through austerities detained in Ravana's inner palace, eyes wide open in fear, Sita said this to me: \"O Rama I have spoken everything that has happened. We have to pay attention to the means of crossing the ocean.\" Coming to know that the two princes were sighing in relief, Hanuman presented the token of identification given by Sita to Rama, after having communicated in full the messsage of Sita in an orderly manner.       Thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus addressed by Hanuman, Rama held the token (Chudamani) against his bosom and wept with Lakshmana. Seeing the precious jewel, Rama's eyes were filled with tears. Overwhelmed with grief, he spoke to Sugriva. \"Just as a cow fond of its calf begins to distil milk from its teats at the sight of the calf, so does my heart melt at the sight of this excellent jewel. \"At the time of marriage, this jewel was presented by my father-in-law. Vaidehi wore it on her forehead and it looked charming. \"This was found in water and was bestowed by Indra out of great joy on Janaka who had performed a grand sacrificial ceremony. So it was worshipped by elders of the family. \"O noble Sugriva now when I see this excellent jewel, I get direct sight of my father and king of Videha (in the same way as I obtained the sight of Sita). \"This jewel was shining on the head of my beloved. Now its mere look makes me feel that I am seeing her. \"O handsome Hanuman Sita is like water for a thirsty person. Tell me again and again what Sita said to you. Sprinkle on me (lifegiving) water of her words in the form of message. \"O Saumitri I see this jewel born (formed) under water but not her. What can be more sorrowful to me? (Addressing Hanuman again) \"O dear, if she can live for a month it is living for long. I would not live for a moment without the black-eyed Vaidehi. \"Take me to the place you saw my beloved. Knowing where she is I cannot stay here even for a moment. \"She is always very timid. How can my fairhipped beloved remain in the midst of dreadful and fearsome demons? \"Her face resembling the autumnal Moon bereft of its stain, though covered with rainclouds does not shine so bright. \"O Hanuman Tell me now truly what has been told by her. I am eager to know. Indeed, it will keep me alive just as medicne does. (I shall survive on the strength of her message) That lovely Sita who speaks sweetly, that fairhipped beautiful one who has been separated from me, my beloved, what did she say? Please narrate.       Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Sundarakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus asked by Sri Rama, Hanuman repeated everything spoken by Sita to Rama. \"O bull among men queen Janaki related to me as a token of identification an incident  that had taken place at Chitrakuta in the past. \"When she was lying on your lap happily she awoke early and a crow came swiftly and scratched on her breast. \"O Bharata's brother, when Sita awoke from sleep you slept on her lap. The same crow again hurt her. Again and again the crow came to her and scratched her. She woke you up as you were getting wet with blood shed from her body. \"O scorcher of enemies pained by the crow hurting her repeatedly, while you were sleeping happily, she woke you up and informed you about it. \"Seeing the blood flowing from her breasts you became furious like a hissing serpent and said: \"You are of timid nature. Who has scratched your breasts with the tip of the nail? Who is sporting with an enraged fivehooded serpent\"? 'Seeing all over, at once I glanced at the crow that stood in front of her with sharp bloodstained nails'. 'That crow, the foremost of the birds was the son of Indra moving about all over the earth swiftly. His speed matched the Windgod's. 'O longarmed, wise and revered Rama, then in anguish you took a cruel decision'. 'You took out a blade of grass from your mat and chanted the mantra to invoke the weapon of Brahma (Brahmastra) and hurled it on the crow. It blazed like the fire of the doom's day. 'You hurled the blazing blade of grass on to the crow. That burning blade of grass chased the crow. 'He was abandoned by his father, even by great sages and gods. Then he went round the three worlds but could not find a saviour. 'O destroyer of enemies the crow came back again to you trembling seeking protection from you and fell on the ground. Even though it deserved to be slayed, you saved him out of compassion. 'O Rama since a divine weapon cannot be withdrawn, it did strike his right eye'.",
                "\"O tiger among men In view of her regards for me and and her love for you she was confident and once again addressed me: 'You may appeal to Rama, the son of Dasaratha in many ways, that he should come quickly and slay Ravana in the battle and get me back. 'O crusher of enemies O brave Hanuman I wish you rest for a while in a secluded place around here and leave tomorrow . 'O valiant (Hanuman) by your presence here, the less fortunate me, will be relieved of sorrow for a while. 'O courageous tiger among monkeys when you depart (abruptly) I doubt if I would be alive by your return. I am an unfortunate one, afflicted by sorrow and tormented (by demons). If I am not able to see you I will be lamenting in grief. 'O brave vanaras I have great doubts about your assistants the vanaras and bears, crossing the ocean. 'How will the vanaras and bears cross this great, impassable ocean? How will the princes Rama and Lakshmna be able to cross it? 'Only three among all beings, Garuda, the Windgod and you have the capacity to cross the ocean. 'O heroic Hanuman you know how to succeed. But I wish to know what expedient you have to accomplish which is difficult by all means. O foremost vanara, please tell me . 'O Slayer of enemy heroes you have the ability to accomplsh this task singlehanded. By succeeding in accomplishing the objective you will become renowned (and not Rama). 'When Rama slays Ravana and his entire army and takes me to his city after becoming victorious it will add glory to him. 'Tell valiant Rama not to take me back the way Ravana, the demon abducted me out of fear. Which is not right. 'If Rama, the slayer of the enemy army, could fill Lanka with his arrows and take me that will be a good sight for him to see. 'You may make arrangement in such a way that the exalted hero Rama exhibits his might according to his stature'. \"Hearing the meaningful, courteous and reasonable words of Sita, I replied : 'O queen The lord of the army of bears and vanaras who is the foremost among the monkeys is endowed with enough strength and has resolved to rescue you. 'Mighty, powerful and tough monkeys who have the speed of thought are under the command of Sugriva. 'All of them can go upward in the sky, downward into the underworld or obliquely in any direction without obstruction. They are brilliant enough to do any great task without any difficulty. 'O great lady the mighty vanaras of extraordinary strength can fly with the wind and have  even circumambulated the earth. 'There are monkeys who are more powerful than me or equal to me. None are less strong than me or Sugriva. 'When I could come here, what to speak of the mightier monkeys?, People do not send the superior ones on errand, but send only the juniors. 'O noble lady give up your lamentation. Enough of sorrowing. The vanara army will fly and reach this place at one leap and fill it. 'O noble lady the lions among men, Rama and Lakshmana who resemble Sun and Moon will ascend on my back and reach here. 'You will see the lionlike Rama, a slayer of enemies and Lakshmana wielding bow in hand standing at the entrance of Lanka very soon. 'You will hear before long the shouts of generals of the vanaras who resemble rainclouds on the mountain roaring like lions from the Malaya mountain of Lanka. 'You will hear before long the shouts of generals of the vanaras who resemble rainclouds on the mountain roaring like lions from the Malaya mountain of Lanka. 'You will soon see Rama, the slayer of enemies crowned as king of Ayodhya with you, having duly completed the term of  exile in the forest'. Sita though afflicted heard from me that you were also in excessive grief on account of separation from her and from my soothing, auspicious and welcome words, she derived comfort and remained quiet.

At the northern gate(of Lanka) are garrisoned one hundred crores of rakshasas constituting, charioteers, horse riding and elephant riding ogres born of noble families, respected and trustworthy (for Ravana). \"Hundreds and thousands of warriors who are unassailable are collected in the center(of Lanka) in multitudes of crores.\" \"I have destroyed some of those roadways, even filled up the moats, burnt parts of the city of Lanka, smashed the boundary walls and killed part of the powerful army.\" \"If by whatever means the passage of ocean can be crossed by vanaras it can be taken for granted that the city of Lanka is destroyed.\" \"Raghava What do we have to do with the rest of the army when Angada, Dwivida, Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Nala and the chief of the army Nila are there?

                "Glorious Rama, of truthful valour, having heard Hanuman in the aforesaid manner, there after spoke (to Hanuman). I will destroy immediately that Lanka of fierce rakshasa, you are telling. I am telling you, this is the truth. I desire to journey at this opportune time. The Sun has reached the mid position and so a good time for victory. Where can the one who has abducted Sita go from here? Just as one who has drunk the poison gets some life sometimes on tasting the nectar of immortality, Sita will attain the desire to live on hearing about my approaching. Today Uttaraphalguni constellation is on the ascent and for me born in Punarvasu star, Hasta, will be in conjunction with the moon. Sugriva You may assemble all the army as I desire to start the journey (as it is auspicious for me). I also see manifestations of good omens to start (the journey). I shall get Janaka's daughter Sita on killing Ravana. My upper eyelids are twitching thus indicating victory and it strikes me that my desire will be fulfilled. There after righteous Rama who is well respected by the king of vanaras and also by Lakshmana, who is wellversed in polity once again spoke. \"Let Nila go leading in front with his courageous and hundred thousand army looking at the way (said Rama)\". \"O Nila, the chief of the army Go fast with the army along the way which has plenty of fruits and roots, shady forests and cool water and sweet smelling honey\". \"Evilminded one, the lord of rakshasas will spoil the roots, fruits and water (on the way). Be ever alert and protect them\". \"O Vanaras You should even look for (the rakshasas) in the low lying lands, in inaccessible water sources, in forests and also beyond sight leaping up to the sky\". \"If there are any weak ones in the army, they may be used here for this purpose (of looking for fruits etc.). Our task (ahead) is a terrific one and be prepared to overcome your power\". \"These hundreds and thousands of lionlike vanaras would walk in groups leading the army like the fierce tides of the ocean\". \"Gaja who is like a mountain in form, Gavaya, the mighty strong and Gavaksha would go like proud bulls that lead the cows\". \"Let the vanara called Rshaba the foremost among the leaping vanaras, take charge of the right side of the army\". \"Let Gandhamadana, the unassailable and powerful vanara resembling the elephant in rut take charge of the left portion of the army\". \"Like the lord of gods riding on Iravatam I would mount on Hanuman and reach the centre of the army encouraging the army.\" \"Let Lakshmana who is like Anthaka (one who excels death) ride on Angada, like the lord of wealth (Kubera) rides on the elephant Saarvabhauma (the elephant that guards the four quarters)\". \"Let Rksharaja the mighty strong Jambavan and Sushena even Vegadarsi protect the rear side (of the army)\". Sugriva the bull among vanaras having heard the words of Raghava ordered the heroic vanaras (to start). Then all the heroic monkeys who were eager for combat jumped down from the caves, mountain peaks and trees. Thereafter righteous Rama who was worshipped by the king of vanaras and Lakshmana went towards the southern direction. Protected by hundreds and thousands, even crores of vanaras and surrounded by a myriad of vanaras Rama went. While Rama was walking the great army of vanaras controlled by Sugriva followed him with great delight. The monkeys went towards southern direction playing, leaping, running and roaring like lions. The monkeys went eating sweet smelling honey and fruits and carrying branches of huge trees having bunches of blossoms. Some wild monkeys carried one another, while some fell, knocked down others, some lifted up and some turned their back and pushed down others. 'We should kill all the rakshasas and Ravana', saying so the vanaras close by Rama were roaring. Heroic Rshaba, Nila and even Kumuda together with many vanaras were searching on the way. Sugriva, Rama and Lakshmana marched in the middle surrounded by powerful and fierce vanaras who can destroy the enemy. Sathavali alone encircled by hundred crore vanara heroes was protecting the army of vanaras. Kesari, Panasa, Gaja, Atibala, Arka and their army of one hundred crores were protecting the army on one side. Sushena, and Jambavan surrounded by the army of Rshaba were guarding by placing on the western side. Nila, the heroic chief of the army who was foremost in the act of flying and descending was going around and controlling. Valiant Darimukha, Prajhanga, Rambha and Rabhasa went about jumping cheering all vanaras. Those vanaras who were tigers among vanaras, proud of their might went to see (on their way) the Sahya Mountains, the foremost of the mountains with trees and creepers, lakes and ponds with fully blossomed lotuses. Those vanaras who were tigers among vanaras, proud of their might went to see (on their way) the Sahya Mountains, the foremost of the mountains with trees and creepers, lakes and ponds with fully blossomed lotuses. The dreadful vanara army expansive as the ocean went knowing about the fear of Rama's wrath. They went avoiding parts of cities and villages making frightening sounds like the great sound of the waves of the ocean. The dreadful vanara army expansive as the ocean went knowing about the fear of Rama's wrath. They went avoiding parts of cities and villages making frightening sounds like the great sound of the waves of the ocean. The heroic and best of the monkeys galloped swiftly on the command of Dasaratha's son like horses that are driven like the steeds. When Rama and Lakshmana, the best among men were borne by Hanuman and Angada they were shining like the planets Jupiter and Venus conjoined with Sun and Moon. Then righteous Rama who is worshipped by the king of vanaras and by Lakshmana went with the army towards the southern direction. Lakshmana, who was borne by Angada, has a good memory and sense of intuition. Set to accomplish his desire fully, he spoke to Rama these auspicious words. Rama After killing Ravana and attaining the desired object of recovering Vaidehi you would go to Ayodhya having accomplished your objective. Raghava I am seeing good signs in the sky and also on land indicating auspicious signs of the accomplishment of your desire. The wind is also favourable and agreeable to the moving army. The sounds of these animals and birds are very sweet. The directions are pleasing, and the Sun is shining brightly. Bhargava who is the master of all knowledge and Sukra, the regent of planet Venus shines brightly behind you. The seven sages who are pure and glowing like fire in brilliance are going round Dhruva. Bhargava who is the master of all knowledge and Sukra, the regent of planet Venus shines brightly behind you. The seven sages who are pure and glowing like fire in brilliance are going round Dhruva. Among the great kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty, the grandfather Trisanku who is a royal sage shines clearly along with Vasishta the foremost priest. The best of stars, Visakha of the highsouled Ikshvakus which is unconnected shines brightly. The star called Niruta (of rakshasas) in the southwest is highly tormented by the touch of the Mula star (close to it) and is oppressed. Everything has sprung up for the destruction of rakshasas. Those that are caught up by death will be oppressed at the time of death. The water is pure and of good taste. The forests are filled with fruits. The wind with fragrance is not blowing excessively or violently. The trees are in bloom beyond season. O King This army of vanaras placed in order is like the forces of gods in their battle with Taraka (a rakshasa who was killed in a battle by Karthikeya) and shines very much. O king, reviewing these (arrangements of army) you ought to be pleased (said Lakshmana to Rama).

O king, reviewing these (arrangements of army) you ought to be pleased (said Lakshmana to Rama). Saumithri reassured his brother who was surrounded by the vanara force saying that those vanaras who use their nails and teeth as weapons and tigerlike bears spread all over the expansive land are proceeding. The terrible dust risen up by the (stamping) legs and hands of the vanara troops spread all over is keeping off Sun's radiance as if creating fear.Alas, the frightening army of vanaras went spreading all over the mountains and forests like the spread of clouds over the sky.

When the army was continuously crossing the river, later (after they crossed) the water flowed excessively like flood. The vanaras went through the pellucid waters of the centre of the lakes. They went obliquely at the mountains, walked on plain lands and underneath trees filled with fruits, plucking them and eating. The great vanara army spread all over the land went with the swiftness of wind with cheerful faces. For the purpose of Rama, the vanaras went showing their valour, happiness and prowess charged with emotion towards one another on the way. They showed their joy and spirit to one another exhibiting their natural youthful enthusiasm, arrogance and several other gestures. For the purpose of Rama, the vanaras went showing their valour, happiness and prowess charged with emotion towards one another on the way. They showed their joy and spirit to one another exhibiting their natural youthful enthusiasm, arrogance and several other gestures. Being vanaras some went swiftly, some jumped, and some others made sound 'kila kila'(the usual sounds of monkeys) while they went. Some hit their tails on the ground, some stamped their feet on the ground, some crushed the mountains with their arms and some broke the trees. Vanaras, being the inhabitants of mountains, climbed on peaks of mountains and made loud noises like snapping and roaring like lions. Some went round and round. With the speed of their shaking thighs, the vanaras broke several meshes of creepers. While yawning also some showed their courage by whirling round and throwing stones and trees. Formidable vanaras in hundreds, thousands, lakhs and crores spread in a splendid manner around the land. The mighty vanara force protected by Sugriva from all sides cheerful at heart, walked day and night speedily. Being eager to somehow liberate Sita they were happy about war and stood nowhere for a while. The mighty vanara force protected by Sugriva from all sides cheerful at heart, walked day and night speedily. Being eager to somehow liberate Sita they were happy about war and stood nowhere for a while. Thereafter having reached the dense forest filled with trees surrounded by the Malaya and Sahaya Mountain inhabited by different kinds of animals, the vanaras assembled. Rama too went to see the wonderful woods and streams of rivers of Sahaya mountain. The vanaras went adoring the Vakula, Tilaka, Mango, Asoka, Tinisa, Sinduvara and Karaveera trees. Vanaras went adoring the Ankola, Karanja, Plaksa, Nyagrodha, Jambu,Amla and neepa trees. Many kinds of trees standing on beautiful rocks and of the forest shaken by the fury of the wind showered their flowers on the vanaras. As the bees humming in delight were spreading the sweet fragrance of honey accompanied the breeze that blew, it was cool like the cool touch of sandal (to the vanaras). That lord of mountains richly adorned with minerals shone very brightly. The mineral particles raised by the stamping of the vanara troops covered the huge vanaras all over. In the mountain ranges were well blossomed trees  such as Kethaka, Sinduvaara and Mango trees Manorama, Madhavi, Kunda, Gulma creepers filled with blossoms of fragrance Chiribilva, Madhuka like wild trees,Vajula,Vakula ,Ranjaka, Tilaka,Kuruvaka, Naga trees Patalaya trees trees with red flowers Arjuna, Simsupa trees with white flowers Kutaja, Dhava and Salmala, Red Kurana, Hinthala,Tinisa,and Churanaka trees, so also dark flowered Asoka trees, Pine trees, Ankola and Padmaka trees were convenient for the monkeys to shake and jump.

In the mountains were reservoirs of water and ponds with cool water inhabited by flocks of Chakravaka birds, water birds like ravens and Krauncha birds. The woodlands were terrific, frequented by boars, bears, hyenas, lions and frightening tigers and many kinds of wild elephants. With flowers in full bloom, the white, blue and red lotuses in the lakes were delightful.

With flowers in full bloom, the white, blue and red lotuses in the lakes were delightful. At that time different kinds of flocks of birds were singing in the mountain ranges. The vanaras after having taken their bath were drinking and sporting with water with each other (pouring water over another) climbing up the mountain. At that time different kinds of flocks of birds were singing in the mountain ranges. The vanaras after having taken their bath were drinking and sporting with water with each other (pouring water over another) climbing up the mountain. Then the vanaras who were deluded with pride climbed the trees and ate the fruits with nectar like aroma, roots and flowers. The tawnyeyed monkeys went joyfully drinking the honey from the large honeycombs hanging there. The vanaras (who are best among leaping animals) went smashing the trees, pulling out the creepers and purposefully destroying the mountains (on their way). While some monkeys that were intoxicated by drinking excessive honey walked where there were no trees, others climbed the tree tops and jumped. That land filled completely with the vanara heroes seemed like a fully ripe paddy field. At that time Lotuseyed Rama of mighty shoulders climbed up the the top of mountain Mahendra adorned with beautiful trees. Then Rama the son of Dasaratha on climbing to the top (of Mahendra mountain) observed the ocean inhabited by tortoises and fish. The vanaras crossing over the great Sahya and Malaya mountains one after another reached near the frightening ocean. Rama, who causes delight to others, got down (the mountain) along with Lakshmana and Sugriva and soon reached the wood on the sea coast. Atonce Rama sprung from there (top of mountain) on to an extensive surface of the earth polished by the waves of the ocean spoke these words on reaching there. Sugriva We have reached the ocean and now we have to think of that idea now, which we thought of earlier. There is only the ocean, the lord of rivers, and the shore is beyond this. We cannot cross the ocean without any mode. We will have to leave the army of vanaras here itself. We have to deliberate how to get the vanaras to the other shore. On seeing the ocean, the mightyarmed Rama, tormented by the abduction of Sita in that way, ordered about the quartering of the vanaras. \"O Best of monkeys Now make preparation for all the army to reside at the sea coast. The time to deliberate about crossing the ocean has set in.\" \"None of the army should go wherever leaving the parasol. The vanara warriors should keep guarding and you may know that it is dangerous\". Having heard Rama's words, Sugriva and Lakshmana made the army to reside on the sea shore filled with trees. That vast (sea of) army of monkeys in tawny colour (settled) at the proximity of the sea (that was white) seemed like a prosperous second sea in bright colour. Then the heroic monkeys having arrived at the forest close to the ocean stood there desiring to reach the other shore. The noise of the ocean was drowned by the great sound produced by the assembly of the army quartered there. The three army groups of vanaras protected by Sugriva encamped for the purpose of Rama appeared enthusiastic. Having arrived at the great ocean and seeing the ocean lashed by the fury of the wind the vanaras felt rejoiced. On seeing the expansive ocean, the vanara army thought 'how to cross the abode of rain god whose shores are far away and not connected and is protected by rakshasas'? As the day was ending and night was setting in, the ocean filled with crocodiles which could catch any animal looked terrific and its waves seemed as if it were laughing and dancing. At the time of the moon rise, the lofty ocean inhabited by dark swift crocodiles, huge Timingala fish scattered in it was rising up with several images of moon reflected in its water. Filled with serpents glowing with flaming gems on hoods, the abode of Varuna (was like underworld) with huge snakes and different mountains under water is a difficult path inaccessible and a fathomless abode of rakshasas (vanaras thought). Swarmed with sea animals like sharks and crocodiles and serpents were jumping with huge volumes of water rising and down with force by the stormy wind. The sea that was the domain of snakes was shining as though sparks of fire from the sky penetrated the drops of sea water. The ocean resembled the sky and the sky like the ocean were identical as no difference appeared. The ocean and the sky filled with gems and stars respectively appeared alike. There was no distinction between the sky with rising clouds and the ocean with moving waves. The waves of the ocean striking each other making frightening sounds like the blowing of war horns seemed as if challenging each other. The enthusiastic vanaras saw the sea inhabited by animals filled with gems and water concentrated in one place rising to the sky, as though infuriated. The rising of the waves (the noise) of the ocean by the cause of wind seemed as if they were talking about. The enthusiastic vanaras saw the sea inhabited by animals filled with gems and water concentrated in one place rising to the sky, as though infuriated. The rising of the waves (the noise) of the ocean by the cause of wind seemed as if they were talking about. The vanaras were wonder struck when they saw the ocean that was noisy with rolling waves as if it was highly agitated and distressed.       This is the end of the fourth Sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Nila settled the army successfully by making them reside on the northern shore of the sea, as per tradition. Dwivida and Mainda, the best of the vanaras, went about in all directions for safeguarding the army. After the army had settled down on the shores of the lord of rivers (sea), Rama spoke to Lakshmana who stood beside him. As time passes, grief passes away. However my sorrow is progressing day by day being unable to see my beloved.  There is no grief in me that my beloved is at a distance, nor that she is taken away. Indeed her age is advancing. On this account I am feeling for her. O Wind Touch that place where my beloved is and touch me as it will give me the same feeling as my beloved's touch. Through the moon I will get her eye contact too. While being carried away that beloved of mine would have cried aloud saying 'oh my lord'. This thought is burning my body as though I have consumed poison in my stomach. The pain of separation from her is working as fuel and the thought about hers is engulfing me as extensive flame and burning my body day and night. O Saumitri Plunging into water alone I will lie down. Probably then the god of love will not be able to consume me while sleeping. Me and Sita are seeking refuge on the same land indeed. Because of that only survival is possible for me, who is desiring for her very much. I am living only because of hearing about her survival, just as a paddy field without water gets wet by the proximity of a neighboring paddy field with water. When will I be able to win the enemies and see that Sita of charming limbs, with large and beautiful eyes like lotus petals, who is like an abundance of fortune? I do not know when I will lift her lotuslike face slightly and drink her beautiful lips like an afflicted man drinks sweet juice.  Indeed I am eager to embrace my chest with hers like the palmyra -fruit trees hold the fruits.When will it happen? That darkeyed lady (Sita), even though she has me (husband), is in the midst of rakshasas. Surely she is sad and emaciated being away from her husband, without a protector. My beloved is king Janaka's daughter and daughterinlaw of Dasaratha. Yet she is sleeping amid Rakshasas. How is it? When will she come out pushing the Rakshasas like the crescent moon comes out pushing the dark clouds in autumn? Sita who is by nature slim would surely be slender due to abstaining from eating, unfavorable time and location. Indeed by shooting arrows into the chest of rakshasa king, when will I get back Sita and cast off grief from my mind. When will Sita, the chaste woman, who is like the daughter of Gods, cling to my neck, and indeed shed tears of joy? When will I get rid of this terrible grief of separation from Mythili for good, just like discarding a soiled garment? While sagacious Rama was wailing in that way the day came to an end with the sun descending to the west. Remembering the lotus petal eyed Sita, Rama who was distracted with grief, comforted by Lakshmana offered evening prayers.  This is the end of the fifth Sarga of Yuddhakanda of the first epic, the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Considering the terrifying, dreadful action that was carried by the great soul Hanuman who was like Indra in might, the Lord of Rakshasas felt a bit shy and bending down his head addressed all Rakshasas. \"(Hanuman) After all a monkey in size, entered the inaccessible city of Lanka, destroyed it and saw Sita, daughter of king of Janaka.\" \"Hanuman destroyed huge mansions, killed topmost Rakshasas and shattered all the city of Lanka.\" \"What is the best thing to do now?

For your own wrong action (of abducting Sita) you cannot undergo suffering.\" Feeling very angry, a Rakshasa called Durmukha said, \"He who has caused shame for all of us does not deserve to be excused.\" \"Furthermore, this assault by a Vanara on Lanka, to the royal residence, and to the prosperous Lord of Rakshasas is despising.\" At this very minute I will go alone into the terrific ocean, to the underworld or the upper world and on entering put an end to the monkey. Then a mighty strong one who was endowed with diamond like teeth highly enraged, clasping a dreadful iron bludgeon stained with flesh and blood spoke. \"While unassailable Rama is there, along with Lakshmana and Sugriva, what have we to do with miserable, pitiable and helpless Hanuman?\" \"Now I would go alone and with the iron crowbar, kill Sugriva Lakshmana and Rama and return after shattering the Vanara troops.\" \"O King If you like, listen to my other statement: One who is cunning and is vigilant would win over an enemy.\" \"O Lord of Rakshasas Thousands of fearful Rakshasas capable of assuming any form at free will, heroic ones of frightful appearance should tell Rama the foremost of Raghus, quietly going near him in human form.\" \"O Lord of Rakshasas Thousands of fearful Rakshasas capable of assuming any form at free will, heroic ones of frightful appearance should tell Rama the foremost of Raghus, quietly going near him in human form.\" \"'We have been sent by your younger brother Bharata and he is coming here very soon with the army.\" \"Then from here we will go there wielding tridents, javelins, maces, swords and arrows.\" Staying in the sky in groups, we will rain astras, sastras and boulders on the Vanara troops and on killing them, we shall send them to the abode of God of death. \"When Rama and Lakshmana are distressed that way, they would certainly succumb to our cunning ways and give up life.\" Thereafter the enraged heroic and valiant son of Kumbhakarna called Nikumbha said to Ravana, who made the world cry. \"Let all of you stay here along with the king. Going alone I will kill Rama along with Lakshmana, and Hanuman also Sugriva and all of the Vanaras.\" Then a Rakshasa called Vajrahanu, mountain like in form, enraged, licking lips with his tongue said these words. All of you giving up fear, do your duties freely move happily sporting and drinking sweet wine. Single handed, I will consume all the Vanara army. All of you giving up fear, do your duties freely move happily sporting and drinking sweet wine. Single handed, I will consume all the Vanara army. \"I alone will kill that Rama with Lakshmana, Sugriva, that Angada, Hanuman and the Vanara army.\"  This is the end of the eighth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",

Therefore, we should think of war only after the above three means are employed.\" \"O Dear at those who are not alert, who are attacked by the enemy, and who are struck by fate, if you examine diligently according to prescribed method and perform deeds of heroic valour you will succeed.\" \"How do you wish to overpower, him who is very attentive, bent on victory, mighty, steadfast, has subdued anger and unassailable?\" \"Hanuman has crossed over the ocean, a Lord of streams and rivers and arrived.

                "Thereafter, determined to relate about righteous and material gains, Vibheeshana of fierce tasks got up early in the morning when the Sun rose and set himself to go to the residence of Lord of Rakshasas. Like a lofty mountain top, and like a summit of a mountain, Ravana's palace was a supreme one, divided into many spacious sections and surrounded by many people. The palace was inhabited by wise ones, and devoted to their Lord and ministers,commanded by trustworthy and competent Rakshasas spread everywhere and well protected. It was filled with elephants in rut breathing heavily, which was like a tempestuous wind around, that echoed by the blowing of conchs of the early morning and filled with the sounds of drums and trumpets. (It was) The royal path was filled with women, with prattling sounds of gossiping. It had shining golden passages and decorated with the best of ornaments. (It was) like the abode of Gandharvas (the celestial musicians), like an abode of wind god, abounding in collection of precious gems, like the mansion of Nagas indulging  in enjoyment. Heroic (Vibheeshana) of exceptional splendour, whose brilliance spread widely like the radiance of the highly lustrous Sun entered his brother's abode. Highly effulgent (Vibheeshana) heard sounds of recitation of sacred mantras from Vedas uttered by learned ones desiring a propitious day for his brother. Mighty Vibheeshana saw there, brahmins learned in vedas and mantras, who worshipped with yellow rice, curd, clarified butter and flowers. Vibheeshana, of broad shoulders, who is revered by Rakshasas was shining in his own splendour. He greeted with folded palms, the brother of Kubera (Ravana) seated on his chair. Vibheeshana who was learned in traditions and wellversed with code of conduct reached a seat decorated with gold blessed by the glance of the king Ravana. When none other than ministers were present, Vibheeshana spoke these meaningful words to the distinguished Ravana, decidedly wishing for welfare. Vibheeshana who knew the good and bad of the world and knew to advice in consonance with place and time said to his elder brother in an appeasing manner, propitiating him observing the customary tradition. \"Since Vaidehi has come to this city, inauspicious happenings are seen by us.\" \"Even from the fire of fire sacrifices, fire particles polluted with smoke are rising and the fire is not burning with brilliance.\" \"In the cooking fire, in places of fire sacrifice, so also at places where offerings are made into fire, serpents are seen. Ants are seen in the Havis.\" \"The udder of cows is dried up, the proud elephants have lost their ichor, the horses are pathetic and neighing. They are not even interested in fodder.\" \"O King the donkeys and camels have shed their body hair and are crying. Even though they are treated for it in different ways they are not getting to be in normal natural form.\" Wild crows are seen in flocks all over the top of aerial chariot sounding harsh gathered in groups. \"Even the eagles are collecting together and standing over the houses of the capital repeatedly in both the auspicious times of morning and evening and making inauspicious sounds.\" At the entrance of the capital are heard thunderous sounds of carnivorous animals collected together sounding like thunder. \"Therefore, the task (of burning Lanka) has commenced. I have thought of this appropriate atonement. Restore Vaidehi to Rama.\" \"O great king You may know that I am not telling like this out of my delusion or greed. You ought not to find fault with me.\" All of us, the Rakshasas and Rakshasa women of the capital, even those in the harem, and all the common people are aware of this offence. All your ministers have abstained from telling you out of fear of you. I must necessarily tell you (as brother) this which is seen and heard. You may determine that which is justifiable by determining the propriety. It is proper for me to submit to you. Brother Vibheeshana thus tendered advice to Ravana, the eminent king of Rakshasas in the presence of his ministers. Foregoing the beneficial, meaningful, and gentle words of counsel of significance in the past, present and future also (given by Vibheeshana), Ravana seized with anger replied in this manner. \"I do not perceive fear from anyone. Rama will not be able to get Mythili at any time. How can the elder brother of Lakshmana withstand me even if Indra and Devatas come (to his help) in battle\" Then mighty tenheaded Ravana of formidable valour, a destroyer of Devatas' army in war, sent away Vibheeshana who had spoken words of good advice in that manner.  This is the end of the tenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Infatuated with passion towards Mythili, disregarded by his dear ones on account of sinful actions, sinner Ravana became weak. Because of the lapse of time, Ravana considered it imminent to consult with his ministers and friends about war. Ravana, having reached, ascended the magnificent chariot that was overlaid with golden latticework, decked with gems and corals, and yoked to trained horses. The tenheaded Ravana, eminent one among Rakshasas climbed up that best of chariots that was making noise like the roaring sound of a huge cloud and went to assembly. Then soldiers wielding swords and different kinds of weapons stood in front of the Lord of Rakshasas. Further (Rakshasas) adorned in different kinds of uncouth attire, wearing different kinds of ornaments went by his side and also at the back. (Some Rakshasa) Charioteers riding on chariots, some on proud elephants and some on horses sporting away followed the tenheaded Ravana. Some holding maces and iron bars, some holding strong iron clubs in hand, and some others holding battle axes, tridents and other weapons went. Then as Ravana entered the assembly thousands of band instruments sounded aloud. Conchs broke forth producing tumultuous noise. As the rattling sounds of the great chariot echoed in all directions, he entered the bright pleasing royal path all at once. The pure white canopy of Ravana held by the Rakshasas spread like lines shone like the Lord of stars (the full moon). A pair of fans with pure crystal like handles with a golden bouquet in the middle glowed. Standing on the ground, all the Rakshasas bowing their heads down and with folded palms offered their salutations to the foremost of the Rakshasas seated in the chariot. Then as the conqueror of foes, an exceptionally splendid one, Ravana was praised by the Rakshasas saying, \"Victory to you, Prosperity to you\", Ravana entered the wellbuilt royal court. Exceptionally splendid one, (Ravana) embodied with glowing body entered the royal court constructed by Vishwakarma, with pillars of gold and silver. Inside of the court was pure like crystal and carpeted with shining golden silk. It was very beautiful and ever shining and guarded by six hundred devils.

Inside of the court was pure like crystal and carpeted with shining golden silk. It was very beautiful and ever shining and guarded by six hundred devils. Ravana sat on a huge excellent seat encrusted with Vydurya gems and covered with deer skin and which had a pillow. Then that Lord like Ravana said \"We have to do a great task against the enemies now. It has to be performed.\" He commanded quick footed messengers to get the Rakshasas to him at once. Those Rakshasas having heard the words spoken by Ravana went to places of recreation, bedrooms and gardens and went round without fear into every house directing the Rakshasas. Those Rakshasas having heard the words spoken by Ravana went to places of recreation, bedrooms and gardens and went round without fear into every house directing the Rakshasas. Of those (Rakshasas) some went on exquisite chariots, some on proud sturdy horses some ascended elephants and some by foot. With chariots, elephants and horses advancing in groups the prosperous capital was shining resembling the flocks of birds in the sky. Parking those vehicles of several kinds at the entrance they entered the royal court by foot like the lions entering the cave of a mountain. They held the feet of the king and on offering salutations to the king took their seat. While some took golden seats, some sat on a kusa grass mat, and some took a se at on the floor. Those Rakshasas (who arrived) at the royal court settled down in appropriate seats on the king's command. The leaders of Rakshasas s at close by Ravana. Those who were learned in decision making, ministers, virtuous and knowledgeable ones, those who can visualise things with their intellect, army men, like wise many heroes and important people collected at the royal assembly shining in golden colour to deliberate on matters for a happy conclusion. Those who were learned in decision making, ministers, virtuous and knowledgeable ones, those who can visualise things with their intellect, army men, like wise many heroes and important people collected at the royal assembly shining in golden colour to deliberate on matters for a happy conclusion. Thereafter illustrious and great Vibheeshana having ascended auspicious and choicest chariot decked with gold and yoked to good horses went to the assembly of his elder brother. There after Vibheeshana the younger brother, repeated his name (by way of courtesy ). A fter that he offered salutations to his elder brother's feet. B oth Sukha and Prahastha likewise followed Vibheeshana and took their seats offered according to their position. In that royal court decorated with different kinds of golden and gem colours, the Rakshasas attired in beautiful clothes with their body smeared with fragrance of incense and sandal paste and wearing floral garland s whose fragrance had spread all over. Those who assembled at the royal court neither made a little noise, nor uttered untruth, nor spoke. All of them were fully accomplished, very heroic and looked at their Lord's face. In that assembly, amid those heroes of great prowess, who held arms, Ravana glowed like Indra, who wields a diamond bolt in battle among the Vasus.   This is the end of the eleventh sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Ravana who is victorious in wars, looking at the vast assembly (of Rakshasas) ordered Prahastha, the chief of the army. \"O Chief of the army You order those who are well versed in the knowledge of all kinds of war and entrust those warriors of four divisions of the army to safeguard the city. Likewise, you ought to order them to be more alert.\" Celebrated Prahastha desiring to carry out the king's order assigned the army inside and outside the city. There after Prahastha, having assigned the army for guarding the city, sat down in front of the king, and appealed. \"You are a powerful one. Your army has been posted outside as well as inside. You may tell me at once without any distraction what you intend to do.\" Ravana who was keen on doing good to the kingdom desiring happiness and having heard Prahastha's word, said this in the midst of his dear ones. \"When there is doubt about dharma, artha and kama, you are capable of deciphering between desirable and undesirable, happiness and sorrow, gain and loss.\" \"The actions carried out by me are always after it is well thought out and decided by all of you. I know that those actions have not failed.\" \"Just as Indra who rules over the moon, sun, stars, and gods attains fortune, accompanied by you I will attain fortune exceedingly at once.\" \"Indeed, rightly I told all of you earlier. Since Kumbhakarna was sleeping I had not informed him about this matter.\" \"Kumbhakarna, the foremost among the wielders of weapons, is very strong. He was sleeping these six months and has arrived now.\" \"This Sita, the consort of Rama was brought from D and akaranya, a place where rakshasas wander.\" \"Sita who walks modestly did not like to enter into my bed (love me ) however much I prayed. I do not think there is anyone who looks like her in the three worlds.\" \"She is a woman of slender waist, plump hips, whose face is like an autumnal full moon. She is gentle and like a golden image. She is like a magical one constructed by Maya.\" \"Beholding her smooth red soles and evenly shaped pinkish nails of feet, love is kindled in me.\" \"On beholding the sacrificial firelike face of Sita glowing like the radiance of the Sun, seeing her prominent nose, her large attractive countenance with beautiful eyes surely, I am overtaken by love and have become a slave to her.\" \"I have been disturbed by passion, which is equal in anger or happiness and makes one pale in grief or agony.\" \"Broadeyed Sita requested me one year time expecting her husband Rama to come (this is a false statement made by Ravana here) and I promised in turn to Sita of beautiful eyes. Just like an exhausted horse that marched I am tired on account of my passion.\" \"Broadeyed Sita requested me one year time expecting her husband Rama to come (this is a false statement made by Ravana here) and I promised in turn to Sita of beautiful eyes.

As such I do not find anyone has the capacity. I am certain of victory.\" On hearing the lamentation of Ravana seized with passion, enraged Kumbhakarna uttered these words. \"If you had at that time, that is before bringing Sita by force, which was accompanied by Rama and Lakshmana, discussed, and thought of, then you would be sure in your mind like the Yamuna River filling the Yamuna (mountain ).\" \"Great king If you had discussed with us about all this action earlier, it would have been very good.\" \"O Ravana Whoever is the king, having a sense of determination, thinks justifiably and carries out princely duties will not regret.\" \"Tasks carried out without proper plan and contrary to the right principles are spoilt like inauspicious oblations offered into sacrificial fire.\" \"He who seeks to perform earlier what has to be done later and does later what have to be done earlier is not a knower of right and wrong.\" A hasty one who acts without thinking of the superior strength (of enemy) gets out at once like the swan penetrates into the crevice of Krauncha (mountain). \"Without prior thought this great act has been done by you. Rama has not killed you, fortunately like poison mixed flesh would kill.\" \"O Sinless Ravana Therefore, that which you have done is not possible for none other than me. I will kill your enemy and accomplish your goal for you.\" \"O Rakshasa I will ruin the enemy. I will fight with both of them (Rama and Lakshmana) even if they are Indra and sun, fire god and wind god or Kubera and Varuna.\" \"If I go with a mountain like body and sharp teeth, holding a huge iron bar roaring like a lion, even Indra will run away out of fear.\" \"By the time he releases a second arrow again, I will immediately drink his blood. Stay quiet with confidence.\" \"By killing Rama, I will try to make you happy and victorious. On killing Rama and Lakshmana like that I will consume the Vanara leaders.\" \"You be free from fear, sporting and drinking the best of wines and doing actions that you like. Rama will be sent to the abode of the god of death. On reaching their Sita will be under your control for long.\"  This is the end of twelfth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",

Setting your foot on the head of enemy you may sport with Sita.\" \"(O Ravana) of great strength Take hold of Sita forcibly like the cock, enjoy and revel with her.\" \"When you have fulfilled your desire, why fear? Let it happen. Let that which is yet to come, happen. You will be able to face.\" \"Kumbhakarna accompanied by Indrajith of extraordinary strength have the power to ward off even if Indra, armed with thunderbolt comes.\" \"Leaving aside charity, conciliation or even by showing dissension, the three means resorted to by the wise people, you will attain success by force.\" \"O Ravana of extraordinary strength We will bring all your enemies under control on their arrival here. There is no doubt.\" Ravana, the king of Rakshasas feeling happy about the statement of Mahaparsva, spoke these words. \"O Mahaparsva I have certain secret that happened in the past. It was a long time ago and I shall tell you. Listen to it.\" \"While I was going in the sky to the abode of Grandfather Brahma, I saw a celebrated one called Punjikasthala flying concealing herself, glowing like the flame of the fire.\" \"Then her clothes were stripped off by me forcibly and enjoyed her. Then like a violently shaken lotus stem, she went to the abode of Brahma.\" \"Then the high souled Brahma happened to know about that incident, I believe. Enraged Brahma made this statement to me.\" \"From today onwards if you desire to resort to a woman forcefully, your head will break into a hundred pieces. There is no doubt.\" \"Thus, frightened on account of his curse, I do not perforce to get her to my lustrous bed.\" \"My speed is like that of the ocean, my movement is like that of the wind and Dasaratha's son does not know this. Therefore, he is coming to attack me.\" \"He is waking me up like waking up a lion sleeping in the mountain cave. Like waking up death from sleep, he is desiring to instigate me. What sort of a person is he?\" \"Rama has not seen my sharp arrows in comb at that are like the forked flame like the tongues of snakes. So, he is coming towards me.\" At once with thunderbolts and meteor like arrows released from my bow will blaze up Rama just like fire sticks whirled at elephants. \"Surrounded by a huge army I will split up his army like the morning Sun splits up stars with his radiance.\" \"Even for the thousand eyed Indra or Lord Varuna it is not possible to withstand me in combat.

We have no fear of birds or reptiles. What fear can we have of the king's son, Rama?\" Then Vibheeshana, wishing the welfare of the king, intent upon Dharma, artha and kama, thinking rightly and deeply, spoke these words on hearing Prahastha's words that were not good. \"That which you intend to accomplish against Rama is not possible either for you or the king and even for Kumbhakarna and Mahodara, just as heaven is not obtained by the unrighteous people,\" said Vibheeshana. \"Prahastha How can you or me or all Rakshasas kill Rama who is knowledgeable of everything, just as one who is not swimming can cross the great ocean.\" \"One to whom righteousness is foremost, who is capable of fighting with eleven thousand warriors as charioteer, (like Dasaratha) who is a glorious scion of Ikshvaku dynasty, who is highly capable in war, in front of whom even gods got bewildered earlier.

You are wicked by nature, cruel, poor in intellect, extremely evil minded, ignorant and have spoken like a child.\" \"Who can bear the arrows released by Rama in combat, which resembles the shaft of Brahma in splendour and flames of fire resembling death and equal to the shaft of the Lord of death?\" \"O King We will offer celebrated Sita to Rama along with wealth, gems, good ornaments, wonderful and beautiful clothes and precious gems and remain here devoid of sorrow.\"  This is the end of the fifteenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic of the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "While Vibheeshana advised in Ravana's favour with all good intention, Ravana who was under the influence of death spoke harsh words. \"One can live with a known enemy or even with an angry and venomous serpent but cannot stay together with one who professes to be a friend and devoted to an enemy.\" \"The behaviour of close relatives in all worlds is known to me. They are happy at the difficulties of relatives.\" \"O Rakshasa Relatives will insult and disapprove their chief even if he is an accomplished one, a virtuous one or a heroic one and does his duty (as a ruler).\" \"Pretending to be friendly forever the relatives rejoice in them is fortunes of their relatives. They create terrible fear like desperadoes and covertly ones.\" \"In the past elephants in the lotus park, uttered some verses on seeing men holding snares in hand. I will relate those that I heard. You may listen.\" \"We have no fear of fire or weapons or noose of death. Selfish relatives are causing fear in us.\" \"It is known that they (paternal relatives) teach the means to catch us. Out of all fears the fear of close relatives is the great difficulty for us.\" \"In the cows' wealth is present, in the brahmins forbearance is seen, in the women capriciousness exists but in close relatives fear is present.\" \"Gentle (Vibheeshana) one Since you belong to the same kinsfolk (as I) you do not like me, who is born of noble descent, attained the position of chief (of clan), is worshipped by the world, and attained sovereignty.\" \"Just as drops of water that fall on lotus leaves do not adhere to each other, like wise however long you spend with an unworthy (relative) one, good friendship does not take place.\" \"Just as honeybees do not have gratitude after drinking (honey) and satisfying, the friendship with an unworthy person like you is of no use.\" \"Just as an elephant takes dust with its trunk and abuses (and spreads on) its own body after taking a bath so also is the association with unworthy ones.\" \"Just as the autumn rain poured out from the thundering clouds does not dampen, in the same way unworthy ones do not have affection.\" \"Just as honeybees do not stay at the flower after satisfaction with the nectar, in the same way is the friendship with unworthy ones.\" \"O Night ranger (Vibheeshana) If any other one had spoken such words, I would not let him live this moment and also destroy. Fie upon you.\" Vibheeshana who was just in his argument rose up, wielding mace in hand accompanied by the four Rakshasas, when Ravana had spoken such harsh words to him. Great Vibheeshana was enraged. Then going up into the sky spoke these words to his brother, the Lord of Rakshasas. \"O King You, being my elder brother, you may tell me What you wish. You are equal to father being elder brother and are to be honoured. But you have not followed the righteous path. The words you spoke are not pardonable.\" \"O Tenheaded king Fallen under the sway of death, you are foolish. You do not understand the well prepared good words spoken by me wishing your welfare.\" \"O King Those who speak pleasingly are always easier to find than those who speak unpleasant but good words. Listeners of unpleasant words (though good) are difficult (to find).\" \"Bound by the noose of death which is the cause of destruction of all beings you are going to be killed just as the burning house if you ignore my advice.\" \"While the sharp golden arrows of Rama burning like fire strike you, I do not wish to see.\" \"Even the heroic archers and mighty men wielding weapons will fall in war seized by death like the dams of sands.\" \"Since you are an elderly one, I desired to tender good advice and spoke these words. I may be excused. You protect all these Rakshasas, this capital city and yourself after I depart. Let you be auspicious and be happy.\" \"Since you are an elderly one, I desired to tender good advice and spoke these words. I may be excused. You protect all these Rakshasas, this capital city and yourself after I depart. Let you be auspicious and be happy.\" \"O King My words (of advice), given in your interest to prevent you, are not palatable to you. Good advice tendered by friends at the time of death will not be received by those beings whose life is over.\"  This is the end of the sixteenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Vibheeshana, having addressed Ravana in harsh language, reached Rama and Lakshmana in a short while. All the Vanaras on the ground saw Vibheeshana who was like Mount Meru in form and shining like a brilliant lightning. His four companions of terrific prowess were also there with him. They were wearing all weapons and were adorned with excellent ornaments. Vibheeshana looked like a mass of cloud, like someone who can cause thunderbolt, possessing excellent weapons and wonderful jewels. Wise Sugriva the Lord of the Vanara army, a formidable one along with Vanaras, started thinking on seeing Vibheeshana (the fifth one) besides four others. Reflecting for a while he addressed Hanuman and the other Vanara leaders in this way. Armed with all kinds of weapons this Rakshasa along with four Rakshasas are coming near to attack. You may see. There is no doubt. Having heard Sugriva's words, all the Vanara leaders taking up Sala trees and boulders uttered these words. \"O King Order us to kill these evil minded ones at once. Being mortals and of short life, on striking, all of them will fall down dead on the ground.\" As they (Vanaras) started conversing, Vibheeshana, having reached the northern shore, stayed in the sky. Great and very wise Vibheeshana, gazing at Sugriva and the Vanaras, addressed them in a loud tone. \"I am called Vibheeshana, the younger brother of Ravana, the king of Rakshasas and of evil conduct.\" \"Having been carried away from Janasthana by him (Ravana) poor and pitiable Sita is detained and protected by the Rakshasas.\" \"I argued with him again and again in several ways to explain him and admonished him saying 'restore Sita to Rama'.\" \"Impelled by death Ravana would not take good words of advice tendered to him just as one who is impelled by death does not take medicine.\" \"Leaving my sons and wife, I have come for protection of Raghava having been put to shame by him (Ravana), spoken to harshly and treated like a slave.\" At once you may inform Raghava who is a protector of the whole world that I, Vibheeshana, are waiting here. Highly valiant Sugriva having heard all this (from Vibheeshana) eagerly spoke these words to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana. \"Ravana's younger brother, known as Vibheeshana, along with four Rakshasas has come to you seeking protection.\" \"O Scorcher of enemies For Vanara's safety and considering to be spies also you should be alert in your deliberations, with a plan and policy in moving together and deciding what is to be done. Let you be safe.\" \"Know that these Rakshasas are heroic, crafty and cannot be trusted. They can change their form at will and can move about without being seen.\" \"This Rakshasa may be a spy who has found entry into our camp to create differences (among us). No doubt about it.\" \"Or else if he is a wise one and knows our weak points, might have found a way and reached us. He may strike us if he is trusted.\" Army of friends or army from a jungle, so also an army brought up by a king for generations, army obtained on payment and all kinds of army except for enemies can be accepted. \"O king, by nature they are Rakshasas, and he is brother of the enemy. Evidently, he has arrived by himself. How to trust him?\" \"O Rama of most forbearing nature Vibheeshana is sent by Ravana. You may consider that he is fit to be arrested, I think.\" \"O Raghava You may know that this Rakshasa is being sent here by deceit ever intending to strike you under the cover of creating confidence.\" \"One who entered the enemy's camp and had access to come inside kills the enemies. It is like an owl killing many crows having entered the hole.\" \"Let us kill this Vibheeshana by punishment along with his ministers as he is the brother of cruel Ravana (said Sugriva to Rama).\" The chief of the army (Sugriva) who knew how to speak appropriately having submitted in that manner to Rama who was adept in expression remained silent. Rama of great fame having heard the words of Sugriva, addressed the Vanara army including the great Hanuman who stood close by. \"The highly reasonable words of advice given by the king of Vanaras about Ravana's brother was heard even by you.\" \"It is always desirable to seek everlasting advice for one's welfare from capable and wise ones by the near and dear ones. It is proper to seek advice on complex matters by one who is in a difficult situation.\" The Vanaras having heard the words spoken by Rama in that way, tendered beneficial advice and their own opinion respectfully, to be vigilant. \"O Raghava there is nothing unknown to you in the three worlds. You are asking our opinion (giving us the honour) out of friendship.\" \"You are a truthful follower of vows, a heroic and righteous one. You are firm in your resolve, capable of good judgment, have a good memory of the past traditions and committed in heart to your friends.\" \"On account of that reason, since your ministers are richly endowed with intelligence let them speak out again and again, one after the other in that way.\" Having said so, Angada the intelligent Vanara spoke these words immediately to Rama for judging Vibheeshana. \"Since he has come from the enemy's camp suddenly, surely Vibheeshana is to be suspected in every way. He is not worthy to be trusted.\" \"One who has a perfidious mind keeps moving about concealing his intention and will attack at weak points, which will be a great inestimable mistake.\" Ascertaining advantages and disadvantages one should take the right course of action, by acting if it is virtuous and giving up if it is faulty. \"If there are great bad qualities (in Vibheeshana) no doubt he has to be rejected. If there are many virtues let us take him knowing them also.\" \"Sarabha has also decided and spoken these meaningful words of advice.\" O Tiger among men Let a spy be assigned to cover him at once.\" \"By employing a spy with subtle intellect to examine Vibheeshana, we can act in an appropriate manner to accept him (Vibheeshana).\" Then, enlightened Jambavan who was endowed with sense of discrimination, considering all facts made his submission which was free from flaws. \"Vibheeshana who has conceived bitter hatred towards the sinful Rakshasa king Ravana came without regard for place and time is always to be viewed with suspicion.\" \"Mainda, who was prudent in making policy and rich in expression, considering all facts expressed this statement that was fully logical.\" \"O king of mortals This is Ravana's brother called Vibheeshana. Let him be slowly and gently interrogated for long.\" \"O Best of kings After truly ascertaining Vibheeshana's intention whether he is wicked or not, you may act wisely (said Mainda).\" On the other hand, Hanuman who was endowed with rich culture spoke these soft, sweet, and meaningful words briefly. \"Even for Brihaspati who is proclaimed to be highly intelligent, it is not possible to surpass you as you are the foremost in capability and eloquence.\" \"O King Rama I am telling this to you truly not for the sake of argument, not for the sake of creating friction, or with a sense of superiority, or desire but out of respect.\" \"Your counsellors have said that after judging good or bad qualities we should accept or reject Vibheeshana. I see a flaw in that statement as such action would not arise.\" \"When entrusted with duty one's capability will be known. It is not possible to appoint him for duty inconsiderately without understanding (his capacity) as it will be faulty.\" \"Your counsellors (Sarabha) have said that it is proper to know from the spies to ascertain about him. It has no meaning as it is not possible to do so (as he is near you). It does not serve the purpose.\" \"This Vibheeshana has come here without regard for place and time. I desire to speak what I feel in this regard.\" \"It seems proper for him (Vibheeshana) to come here, considering place and time and so also considering that you are superior to him (Ravana) even if there are demerits in him and merits in you.\" \"He has thought over and seen wickedness in Ravana, likewise valiance in you has made you come here. He seems to be right and suitable.\" \"O king People of unknown identity should enquire about him. (Vibheeshana)\" said Mainda. Having reviewed the matter, I have another view. (in the matter).\" \"If enquired suddenly, a wise one will also become suspicious of his words. Even a friend who has come there will seem like a wicked one to him.\" \"O king It is not possible to know the intention (of an enemy) of others at once without excessive dexterity. It is to be known by his tone of words and description.\" \"Even when one is speaking, his malevolence is known. It does not seem so as his countenance is also pleasing. Therefore, I have no doubt (of him).\" \"One who is with deceitful feeling will not come without an expression of suspicion. He has come on his own and even his talk and looks are not suspicious to me.\" \"Even if one intends to hide in his external form, it is not feasible to keep it concealed. The inner feeling of a man gets revealed even if cleverly hidden.\"",
                "Having heard Hanuman (son of wind god) formidable Rama was highly pleased at heart and started to tell his opinion. \"Even I desire to speak a few words about Vibheeshana. I wish you, who are my well wishers and devoted to me, also hear me.\" Although he (Vibheeshana) has defects, as he has come here with a friendly feeling, I cannot reject him. Good people are not reprehensible. Then Sugriva, the leader of Vanaras reflecting on what was spoken by Rama said these words favouring Rama. \"Let this Rakshasa (night ranger) be a wicked one or not a wicked one, what have we to worry about such a person? He has come here abandoned by his brother and who will not send away such a person? Who will not do so?\" On hearing the words of the king of Vanaras, Rama of Kakuthsa dynasty and of truthful valour looked at all and threw a smile slightly at meritorious Lakshmana and spoke these words. On hearing the words of the king of Vanaras, Rama of Kakuthsa dynasty and of truthful valour looked at all and threw a smile slightly at meritorious Lakshmana and spoke these words. \"That which has been spoken by the Lord of monkeys in this way is not possible for one who has not studied sastras or served the elders.\" \"It strikes me that in this regard, as it is openly known for all the kings or at least in a subtle manner from a worldly point of view.\" \"When in difficulty kings of the same clan of adjoining countries keep attacking the renowned and so they are declared as enemies. It is on account of this cause he (Vibheeshana) has come here.\" \"The sinless ones respect the kings of their clan as friendly ones. But by and large such kings also do not believe the virtuous ones among the kings.\" \"I will tell you what the scriptures have said about the demerit in accepting an enemy's strength that you have spoken. You may listen.\" \"We do not belong to their clan. Among Rakshasas there are some learned ones. Vibheeshana has come because of his desire for their (Rakshasa) kingdom, perhaps ?\" \"Kinsmen will not be satisfied with one another and are not free from anxiety. That way they will not be together. Vibheeshana who has come out of fear in this way crying loudly for help and is worthy to accept.\" \"O dear All brothers cannot be like Bharata, all sons will not be like me, or all friends like you.\" When Rama had spoken that way, sagacious Sugriva along with Lakshmana got up and saluted him and spoke these words to Rama. \"Rama, you are exceptional in excusing Vibheeshana. Realize that he has been dispatched here by Ravana. I consider befitting for you to captivate him.\" \"O sinless mightyarmed Rama I believe that this Rakshasa has been sent to come here covertly to strike at you or me or Lakshmana. On knowing that you are here the cruel Ravana's brother has come greedily along with his counsellors to kill you.\" Sugriva the chief of the army, who was good at speech and adept in expression, having said to Rama, the best among the Raghu race, remained silent thereafter. \"O sinless mightyarmed Rama I believe that this Rakshasa has been sent to come here covertly to strike at you or me or Lakshmana. On knowing that you are here the cruel Ravana's brother has come greedily along with his counsellors to kill you.\" Sugriva the chief of the army, who was good at speech and adept in expression, having said to Rama, the best among the Raghu race, remained silent thereafter. Having heard the words of the leader of Vanaras that were nobler, Rama spoke these auspicious words. \"Whether this night ranger is wicked or not wicked, is he capable of doing even subtlest harm to me?\" \"O leader of the Vanara troop If I so desire, I can kill with the tip of my big finger the devils, Danavas, Yakshas and the Rakshasas on this earth.\" \"You have heard of the (story of a) dove that offered his own flesh to an enemy who came to seek protection according to tradition (of hospitality).\" \"O Supreme Vanara When the fowler who had carried away the mate came near the dove it received him and in turn protected him. What more can a man like me do?\" \"In the past Kanva's son called Kandu, a sage and a truthful one used to sing verses inculcating righteousness. (I shall recite) You may listen.\" \"O scorcher of enemies To one who greets reverentially with folded hands and begs for protection, we should not be cruel, and he is not to be killed.\" An enemy who comes for protection against another enemy should be protected, even giving up one's own life whoever he may be, even if he is afflicted or arrogant. \"If one does not protect, or give refuge, according to his capacity out of fear, desire (to gain) or delusion, the sin acquired by him will be censured by the world.\" \"One who fails to protect a refugee who seeks protection from him is ruined in the eyes of the refugee and he takes away all the merit.\" \"One who resorts to failure in protecting a refugee, will be doing a great sin that way and will be shut out of heaven, be infamy and his strength and virility will be lost.\" \"Excellent and meaningful words have been said by sage Kandu (about one who protects a refugee), that is by doing one's righteous duty. He will be not only famous but reach heaven as a result of his action.\" \"I will provide protection from all living beings for the one who seeks protection from me and begs in this way. This is my vow.\" \"O best of Vanaras Sugriva Either Vibheeshana or any one by himself and even Ravana who is unprotected thus seeks security from me, I will offer protection.\" Having heard the inciting words spoken by Rama so lovingly, the king of Vanaras replied. \"What wonderful words have been spoken by you, Rama? You are the knower of righteous duty, protector of the world, a virtuous and upright one.\" \"My inner self is aware that this Vibheeshana is pure. He has been tested in all respects with doubtful feelings.\" \"Rama therefore, let this highly sagacious Vibheeshana be with you like a friend in equal terms and enjoy.\" Perceiving Sugriva's befitting words, king Rama went to meet Vibheeshana like Indra arranged to meet with the king of birds.    This is the end of the eighteenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When wise Vibheeshana, the brother of Ravana was assured of security by Raghava, he looked around the ground and prepared (to descend). Righteous Vibheeshana descended from the sky and fell at the feet of Rama accompanied by his devotees happily (considering it to be inappropriate to come with foot down he came straight down with his body). Thereafter Vibheeshana and the four Rakshasas who sought shelter prostrated lying at the feet of Rama expressing their duty, duly and placing confidence in Rama who spoke these words showing extreme joy. \"I am Ravana's younger brother. Having been put to shame I came to seek protection from you who are the protector of all beings \" (Vibheeshana said to Rama).\" \"Leaving Lanka, my friends and my wealth I came to you. Now my life, kingdom and welfare are at your disposal.\" \"On hearing those words (of Vibheeshana) that were soothing to him as if he drank (Vibheeshana's love) with his both eyes, Rama asked Vibheeshana to truly relate the strength as well as weakness of the Rakshasas.\" \"On hearing those words (of Vibheeshana) that were soothing to him as if he drank (Vibheeshana's love) with his both eyes, Rama asked Vibheeshana to truly relate the strength as well as weakness of the Rakshasas.\" Then the Rakshasa (Vibheeshana) having heard that Rama of unwearied action would save him proceeded to speak out about the strength of Ravana. \"Oh Prince, by virtue of a boon granted by Brahma, the selfborn to the tenheaded Ravana, he cannot be killed by Gandharvas, Rakshasas and by all beings.\" \"My elder brother, the one who is younger to Ravana is a highly valiant one endowed with great prowess. He is Kumbhakarna and equal to Indra in war.\" \"Rama You might have heard of Prahastha who the commander in chief of his (Ravana's) army is by whom Manibhadra (Kubera's Commander of Army) was defeated in a comb at in Kailas (the abode of Siva).\" \"He (Ravana's eldest son) who is possessed of Iguana skin on his hands (to protect), and with a shield that cannot be pierced and who remains unseen in comb at wielding a bow is Indrajith.\" \"Raghava Indrajith strikes when caught by a network of foes in war by becoming invisible because of satisfying fire god.\" \"Mahodara, Mahaparsva, Akampana are Rakshasas who are like the guards of the world. They are the commanders of his (Ravana's) army.\" \"Thousands of Rakshasas inhabit the city of Lanka living on flesh and blood and changing their form at will.\" \"The unassailable rulers of the world and even celestial beings have been shattered by Ravana accompanied by the Rakshasas.\" Rama of mighty prowess having heard everything from Vibheeshana, examining in his mind, spoke. \"Vibheeshana Those actions resorted to by Ravana which have been spoken by you in essence are known to me.\" \"By Killing the tenheaded Ravana along with Prahastha and relatives I will make you the king. I am telling you, this is true.\" \"Even if Ravana enters the hell or underground or the abode of Brahma the creator, I will not let him be alive.\" \"I vow upon my three brothers that I will not enter Ayodhya without putting an end to Ravana along with his people, sons and relatives.\" After having heard the words of Rama of untiring in action, Vibheeshana of righteous nature, started to speak with his head bent down (in reverence). \"I will render assistance with all my strength for storming Lanka, for killing the Rakshasas and for the army to enter.\" When Vibheeshana had spoken in that manner, Rama was pleased and embraced him. He called for Lakshmana to get water from the ocean (for consecration). \"I am pleased with this highly intelligent Vibheeshana, a respectable one. I will coronate him at once as king of Rakshasas.\" (Rama) having spoken that way, Saumithri crowned Vibheeshana as crowned king on the command of Rama amid Vanara army chiefs. At that instant the Vanaras jumped, moving about exhibiting their joy on witnessing great Rama's grace saying \"Good, good.\" Hanuman and Sugriva enquired of Vibheeshana as to how to cross this ocean that is imperturbable along with the entire lot of energetic Vanara army. \"What strategy should we adopt to cross this abode of Varuna, the Lord of rivers and streams with the entire army of Vanaras?\" (Hanuman and Sugriva asked Vibheeshana). (Hanuman) having asked so, righteous Vibheeshana said, \"O king Raghava We ought to go and seek refuge from the god of the ocean.\" \"This immeasurable great ocean was excavated by Sagara (A King of the Ikshvaku dynasty). The great ocean needs to do the task of Rama who is of the same race.\" Vibheeshana having spoken in that manner, Sugriva accompanied by Lakshmana reached near Rama. Thereafter broadnecked Sugriva started to communicate to Rama the advice of Vibheeshana about Sagara. To Rama who was by nature righteous the advice (of Vibheeshana) was pleasing. To the brilliant Lakshmana of skilful action, to Sugriva the king of monkeys, Rama said smilingly. To Rama who was by nature righteous the advice (of Vibheeshana) was pleasing. To the brilliant Lakshmana of skilful action, to Sugriva the king of monkeys, Rama said smilingly. \"Lakshmana This advice of Vibheeshana is pleasing to me. Sugriva is learned, and you are always capable of good advice. That which appeals to both of you, and which is meaningful may be informed to me.\" Heroic Rama having said that way to both, Lakshmana and Sugriva replied thus respectfully following tradition (with folded hands). \"O Raghava, the tiger among kings Why will this good advice given to us at this time by Vibheeshana be not pleasing?\" Sugriva and Lakshmana said to Rama.\" Without building a bridge over this terrific ocean, the abode of Varuna, it is not possible to cross over to Lanka even for Indra, suras or Asuras. \"Valiant Vibheeshana's words are true. Let us proceed and let us not waste time. Let us request Sagara to help the army to be able to proceed to Lanka ruled by Ravana (Sugriva and Lakshmana said to Rama).\" \"Valiant Vibheeshana's words are true. Let us proceed and let us not waste time. Let us request Sagara to help the army to be able to proceed to Lanka ruled by Ravana (Sugriva and Lakshmana said to Rama).\" Then when they (Sugriva and Lakshmana) said so to Rama, he sat on Kusa grass mat on the shore of the ocean just as fire stayed in the sacrificial altar.    This is the end of the nineteenth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then the heroic Rakshasa called Shardula entered into the area encamped by the army under Sugriva's command and saw the sign flag of the army. The evil minded raskshasa who was a spy of Ravana went back to Lanka speedily unruffled after having observed all over the camp and spoke these words to Ravana. As if it is a second ocean deep and immeasurable, the ocean of Vanaras and Bears are heading towards Lanka (reported the spy). \"Great sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, endowed with beautiful form and exceptional fortitude have come and set their foot on the seashore and settled to come to Sita.\" \"Great sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, endowed with beautiful form and exceptional fortitude have come and set their foot on the seashore and settled to come to Sita.\" \"Mighty king Ravana the army also is spread all over ten yojanas. I have seen going round the sky. You ought to know the real situation at once.\" \"O king at once your spies should be deployed there and entrusted to have claims either by conciliation or creating differences.\" Ravana the tiger among Rakshasas, after having heard Shardula's words decided within himself and said to Suka who is good at work praising him very much as usual. \"Departing quickly, speak to the king Sugriva boldly without getting disturbed but in a gentle way and communicate this message.\" \"O Sugriva, king of Vanaras You are born in a race of eminent kings, a mighty son of Rksharaja. Even a little harm has not been done to you by me. I am like your brother (Ravana's words to Sugriva to be communicated by Suka).\" \"Sugriva What harm is done to you if I have brought the consort of prince? You are a wise one, go back to Kishkinda.\" \"It is not possible for Vanaras to get here even for Gandharvas or Devas also. What to say of humans and Vanaras? (You may tell this to Sugriva).\" Thus, commanded by the ruler of Rakshasas, Suka immediately transformed into a bird form and rose apace into the sky. Suka having gone a long way in the sky to a distant place, stationed there spoke these words to Sugriva. Thus, commanded by evil minded Ravana, Suka communicated everything as spoken by Ravana. At once the Vanaras rose and started to injure Suka with their fists. At once the Vanaras violently seized the night ranger Suka and held him and threw him down to the ground from the sky. Being attacked by Vanaras, Suka told these words. \"Oh Kakuthsa Rama messengers should not be killed. It will be good to prevent the Vanaras.\" \"The envoy who puts aside the king's opinion and expresses his own opinion, which has not been said by the king ought to be killed.\" After hearing the appeal of Suka and seeing the monkeys shouting, Rama spoke indicating not to kill him. Suka, felt secure in the air and finding monkeys also settled, once again spoke these words. \"Oh Sugriva Who is rich in spirit and endowed with mighty prowess What should I convey to Ravana who makes the world cry?\" Suka having spoken in that way, Sugriva the leader of the monkeys who was not depressed in his spirit spoke these pleasant words to the Rakshasa spy. \"O Rakshasa, you are the one who deserves death (Convey to Ravana this as my word). You are an enemy to my friend, like wise you are not worthy of sympathy, not my well wisher and also not dear to me. You are Rama's enemy, so like your relative Vali you are to be killed.\" \"O Night ranger Ravana I shall kill all your sons, relatives, your kinsfolk. I shall come at once and even burn Lanka into ashes with my mighty prowess.\" \"O Foolish Ravana Even if you go to a secret place, or rendered invisible by your interposition, or go into the orbit of the Sun, or go underground to Patala or go to the feet of Lord Siva for protection, you cannot escape from Rama. You along with your brother will be slain.\" \"O Foolish Ravana Even if you go to a secret place, or rendered invisible by your interposition, or go into the orbit of the Sun, or go underground to Patala or go to the feet of Lord Siva for protection, you cannot escape from Rama.

Why did you not take her away in the presence of Rama or even Lakshmana?\" \"You do not understand that the foremost of Raghu's, a benevolent one, is difficult to overcome even for Indra. He will take away your life with his extraordinary might.\" \"Then Angada, the noble one among Vanaras, the son of Vali, said,\" O King, to me it appears that he is not a messenger but a spy.\" \"While standing here surely he has assessed the entire strength of the army. I hope he is taken as a captive and not returned to Lanka.\" Then having been commanded by the king he caught the forlorn wailing Rakshasa Suka and bound him. \"Thereafter Suka who was severely tormented by the Vanaras went towards benevolent Rama and wailed.\" \"If my wings are cut off and my eyes are injured, on account of that inauspicious act you will take on all sins of my life from the night I was born till the night I am dead leaving my original form, even will happen (Suka tells Rama).\" \"If my wings are cut off and my eyes are injured, on account of that inauspicious act you will take on all sins of my life from the night I was born till the night I am dead leaving my original form, even will happen (Suka tells Rama).\" \"Having heard the lamentation, Rama said to the Vanaras\" Do not kill him. Set him free as he had come as an envoy.\"    This is the end of the twentieth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Raghava the destroyer of foes, offered his obeisance turning his face towards east, spread the kusa grass mat on the seashore and lay down resting his head upon his shoulders like a coiled serpent.

As Rama kept himself alert with a vow and lay on the kusa grass m at spread on the ground, three nights rolled fast. Rama, a lover of dharma, who had political foresight, spent three nights waiting upon the ocean, the Lord of rivers. Though Rama remained selfrestrained and respected the ocean well according to propriety, the ocean was dull and did not show its real form. Enraged at the ocean, Rama's eyes turned red. He went near Lakshmana who was endowed with auspicious marks and thus addressed. \"Why is it that the ocean does not show up to me? Indeed, calmness, forbearance, straightforwardness, politeness of speech are all attributes of virtuous qualities and one without these attributes are considered incapable.\" \"Indeed, the world treats one with respect, who praises himself, as an impudent one, an unchaste one and one who goes about with a rod of punishment (not the one who is virtuous).\" \"O Lakshmana Neither fame nor popularity can win a battle front in this world.\" \"Saumithri Witness the crocodiles shattered by my ruthless arrows jumping and floating in the ocean with water splashed on all sides.\" \"Lakshmana See here the coils of serpents, huge snakes, fish and large sea elephants cut into pieces by me.\" \"I shall make the ocean dry up with its shells and conchs, fishes and crocodiles in this great combat.\" \"By my being tolerant, this ocean treats me to be incapable. Endowed with such qualities of forbearance, I will show the people (ocean).\" \"The ocean has not shown his own form to me. O Lakshmana Get the bow and venomous snake like arrows, I will dry up the ocean and the Vanaras can walk by foot and go.\" \"The ocean has not shown his own form to me. O Lakshmana Get the bow and venomous snake like arrows, I will dry up the ocean and the Vanaras can walk by foot and go.\" \"(The ocean) Having made me angry, now I will torment the ocean even though it is imperturbable and has its limits. I will torment the ocean with its thousands of waves and mighty demons by my arrows and make the ocean cross its boundary.\" \"(The ocean) Having made me angry, now I will torment the ocean even though it is imperturbable and has its limits. I will torment the ocean with its thousands of waves and mighty demons by my arrows and make the ocean cross its boundary.\" Having spoken like that, Rama with his flaming red eyes seemed like the flame at the end of the universe and unassailable. Bending the terrific bow, he released frightful arrows like Indra (who released thunderbolts) who performed a hundred sacrifices. Glowing in brilliance like flame, the arrows of the best among the arrows pierced like snakes into the water of the ocean. Then the ocean seemed terrible with the fish and crocodiles rushing out with the speed of water and powerful wind. With the movement of the sea water filled with the conchs and shells suddenly terrific smoke whirling round and rising played around. Those snakes with blazing hoods and glowing eyes residing in the underworld and the demons became oppressed. Thousands of waves of the ocean rose like the peaks of Vindhya and Mandara mountains. The waves rose up tossing and whirling about. The agitated Nagas and Rakshasas were thrown up by a highly disturbed ocean that produced a great sound. Then Saumithri got up and rushed very fast to Rama who was stretching his bow exceedingly and breathing hard in anger and said, 'no more, no more' and seized the bow.   This is the end of the twenty first sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, Rama uttered, \"I shall make you dry up to the underworld\", to the ocean that made his terrific presence. \"O Ocean When your water is dried up to the core by my arrows, huge sand will appear.\" \"O Ocean, now the monkeys will go to the other side of the shore on your drying up with all the creatures inhabiting you by the rain of arrows showered by me.\" \"You, who are the abode of demons are not aware of my valour and prowess. You are not aware of the sorrow that you will face from me.\" Rama proceeded to stretch the mighty bow that resembled the rod of punishment of Brahma energized by Brahma and released that best of bows. When Rama released the arrows from the bow, at once the sky to the earth including mountains trembled. Then darkness engulfed the world, the directions were not noticeable and further the rivers were agitated. The Sun and moon moved obliquely (from south to North) along with the stars. On account of the darkness that covered even the sun was not shining. The sky lighted by the meteors shone and unparalleled thunder shot forth. The Sun and moon moved obliquely (from south to North) along with the stars. On account of the darkness that covered even the sun was not shining. The sky lighted by the meteors shone and unparalleled thunder shot forth. Then terrific wind blew breaking forth the clouds, which is an abode of cold water, taking them away in upward direction breaking trees. Huge clouds collected were moving at extraordinary speed in the sky breaking mountain peaks. Those clouds in the sky sent forth fire of lightning making a loud sound. The creatures like humans etc. That could be seen and those that could not be seen like devils and ghosts remained still out of fear. Few other creatures came out of their place even though it was cold. Some were thrown off from their habitation in fear although they were together.

Few other creatures came out of their place even though it was cold. Some were thrown off from their habitation in fear although they were together. There after those waves of water with its creatures, serpents and demons were at once thrown off at terrific speed that was unprecedented. They were thrown beyond a yojana by the high tides. There after those waves of water with its creatures, serpents and demons were at once thrown off at terrific speed that was unprecedented. They were thrown beyond a yojana by the high tides. Rama the destroyer of foes did not attempt at the ocean that went far from the boundary, which was transgressing and overweening. Then Sagara, the Lord of the ocean himself rising like the Sun over the mighty Meru Mountain rose from the middle of the ocean. Then the Lord of the Ocean shining like the Vaidurya stone decked in pure gold as if blazing appeared along with serpents. Clad in red coloured robes, endowed with lotus petal like eyes having a wonderful wreath of diverse flowers on head, decked in shining ornaments of polished gold encrusted with precious gems from his own territory, he resembled the Himalayan Mountain with minerals. He had a hanging pearl necklace in the centre of his bosom shedding white lustre that resembled the Kausthuba of Lord Vishnu. With several tides moving near, and multitude of tides reaching the clouds threatening, surrounded by Goddesses of several forms and deities of important rivers like Ganga and Sindhu, the valiant Lord of the ocean greeted with folded palms and spoke these words to Rama who was wielding an arrow in his hand.

With several tides moving near, and multitude of tides reaching the clouds threatening, surrounded by Goddesses of several forms and deities of important rivers like Ganga and Sindhu, the valiant Lord of the ocean greeted with folded palms and spoke these words to Rama who was wielding an arrow in his hand. \"Noble Rama Earth, wind, space, water, and fire, the five elements remain in their path strictly following their nature.\" \"I am fathomless and as such not capable of being swum across as it is my nature too. My fording will be a deviation. I proclaim to you (how you can cross).\" \"O Lord of the land Out of desire or covetousness or even out of fear I will not be able to solidify the water infested with poisonous animals.\" \"O Rama I shall arrange a base in such a mode, by means of which the entire army of Vanaras can cross over the passage and I will also be seizing the poisonous animals and not be aggressive.\" Then Rama said, \"O abode of Varuna, listen to me. In which location should I allow this unfailing mighty arrow to descend?\" On hearing the question of Rama, the mighty ocean seeing the brilliant arrow spoke these words to him. \"To my north there is a holy place called Drumakulya, famous like you, and you have scope to act there (to descend the arrow).\" \"Marauders of terrific action, who are enemies of gods whose chief is Abhiras, live there drinking my (ocean) water performing sinful acts.\" \"Rama I cannot tolerate the touch of ones who are sinful in action. Therefore your (of descending this arrow down) mighty unfailing arrow can be released on them.\" On hearing the words of the request of Sagara and on account of seeing him, Rama let off the supreme arrow glowing (on the marauders). By the letting down of the dart that resembled the glow of Indra that part of the land was indeed popularly known as Marakantara (Marwar and Bikaner region of Rajasthan). At that part of the earth that was creviced by the piercing of the dart, water came out from the underworld. That well (hole created by the dart) came to be known as Vrana. The water springing out of it forever is like sea water. A crack caused in the ground by letting off the dart produced terrific sound and by that, the water in the cavities of the ground dried up. Marukantaram is famous in the three worlds. Dasaratha's Rama, who is learned and has the valour of gods made the cavities dry and gave a boon. Marukantaram is famous in the three worlds. Dasaratha's Rama, who is learned and has the valour of gods made the cavities dry and gave a boon. By virtue of Rama's boon Maru became a beautiful land with tender grass for cows, with less diseases, very ideal for fruits, roots, and juicy foods, for plenty of milk, and suitable for fragrance, diverse kinds of medicinal herbs. Endowed with these virtues it became a holy and auspicious place. By virtue of Rama's boon Maru became a beautiful land with tender grass for cows, with less diseases, very ideal for fruits, roots, and juicy foods, for plenty of milk, and suitable for fragrance, diverse kinds of medicinal herbs. Endowed with these virtues it became a holy and auspicious place. Thereafter when that land of Drumakulyam was burnt (by Rama's arrow) the Lord of rivers looked at Rama who was learned in all sastras spoke these words. \"Noble Rama This prosperous one named Nala is the son of Vishwakarma. Since he has obtained boons from his father, he is equal to his father in architecture.\" \"This monkey is full of zeal. He will build a bridge over me, and I will bear it. In that way he is like his father.\" Having spoken in that way, the Sea God disappeared. Nala, the foremost of vanaras, got up there after and spoke these words to mighty Rama. This fearsome ocean of mighty Sagara (dug by Sagara) then allowed a passage for Rama, out of fear of punishment and also to witness the building of a bridge. \"On the Mandara mountain Vishwakarma gave a boon to my mother. I am that Vishwakarma's own son, and I am like him at work by that cause. I have put in my memory all about the ocean. I am aware of the truth of the ocean. I could not speak of my qualities unless questioned. I can build a bridge over the abode of Varuna.Right away let the Vanara leaders get the material required for building the bridge (said Nala).\" \"On the Mandara mountain Vishwakarma gave a boon to my mother. I am that Vishwakarma's own son, and I am like him at work by that cause. I have put in my memory all about the ocean. I am aware of the truth of the ocean.

I can build a bridge over the abode of Varuna.Right away let the Vanara leaders get the material required for building the bridge (said Nala).\" Then directed by Rama the Vanara troop leaders in hundreds and thousands sprang up gladly all over the huge forest. Mountain like bodied Vanara bulls there upon started collecting roots of trees from the foot of mountain and moved them into the sea. The Vanaras brought sala, asvakarna, dhava, bamboo, kutaja arjuna, palmira, tilaka, trisaira, bilva, saptaparni trees karnikara plants with blossoms, mango trees and ashoka trees and dumped into the ocean. The Vanaras brought sala, asvakarna, dhava, bamboo, kutaja arjuna, palmira, tilaka, trisaira, bilva, saptaparni trees karnikara plants with blossoms, mango trees and ashoka trees and dumped into the ocean. Lifting some trees with roots and some without roots like the staff of Indra's flag, Vanaras hurled down the trees into the sea. They brought palmira, dadima, coconut, karira, bakula and nimba trees and dropped all of them into the ocean. The Vanaras of huge body size and strong like elephants collected stones and mountains, lifted them, and transported into the sea. At once the water threw up (by dropping the mountains) rose, touching the sky and spreading. On account of throwing into the sea it got stirred up Others held the rope over a hundred yojanas in breadth (to make it even). Nala started the task of building the huge bridge in the centre of the ocean with Vanaras. Others held sticks and some held logs of wood and reeds following the command of Rama, hundreds of Vanaras who looked like clouds and mountain tops built the bridge. Others held sticks and some held logs of wood and reeds following the command of Rama, hundreds of Vanaras who looked like clouds and mountain tops built the bridge. The Vanaras who were like Danavas, huge mountains in size were seen seizing boulders from the mountain, the trees with blossoms, and creepers for binding the bridge and running. By hurling off the mountains in that lofty ocean and throwing stones, a tumultuous sound arose. Elephants like monkeys rejoiced over building speedily fourteen yojanas the distance of the bridge on the first day. In the same order the Vanaras of fierce bodies and extremely strong ones soon built twenty yojanas on the second day. Endowed with huge body that way the Vanaras built extremely fast, twenty one yojanas on the third day. There upon at once Vanaras of great speed built twenty two yojanas on the fourth day. Similarly, on the fifth day the Vanaras endowed with great impetus built twenty three yojanas and crossed Mount Suvela. Nala the son of Vishwakarma, the foremost of the Vanaras and strong like his father built the bridge in the sea. The bridge was built on the sea, an abode of crocodiles, was auspicious, glorious, and looked like the street in space (milky path). The Gandharvas, gods and even siddhas felt happy and reached their stationed in the sky to see the wonderful bridge. Gods and Gandharvas witnessed the bridge built by Nala that was ten yojanas in width and hundred yojanas in length. The monkeys were jumping about here and there roaring (in joy). All creatures witnessed the bridge that was inconceivable, marvellous, thrilling, and impossible to build constructed in the sea. The monkeys were jumping about here and there roaring (in joy). All creatures witnessed the bridge that was inconceivable, marvellous, thrilling, and impossible to build constructed in the sea. The glorious Vanaras in thousands of crores reached the other side of the sea from the bridge constructed in the great sea. That huge bridge was well built, magnificent, evenly built, and extensive and looked charming like the partition in a woman's hair. There upon Vibheeshana holding the mace stood on the other side of the ocean along with his friends to slay the enemies. Sugriva addressed Rama of truthful valour and said, \"You mount on heroic Hanuman, let Lakshmana climb on Angada. These Vanaras will hold you up in the sky and assist you to cross the ocean.\" Sugriva addressed Rama of truthful valour and said, \"You mount on heroic Hanuman, let Lakshmana climb on Angada. These Vanaras will hold you up in the sky and assist you to cross the ocean.\" Accompanied by Lakshmana and joined together with Sugriva, glorious and righteous Rama walked in front of the army. While some monkeys walked in the middle some went in the side, some others were falling down in water (for the want of space to walk) some others went like birds in the path of the sky. The terrific sound caused by the frightening advancement of massive monkey troops the sound of the ocean got drowned. The Vanara army having crossed the bridge of Nala by the king's order settled on the other shore that was filled with several roots and fruits. At once the gods, siddhas, charanas and sages came towards Rama looking at his wonderful and most difficult action and sprinkled auspicious water on him individually. (As a mark of worship and blessing). \"O Rama the Lord of human beings Let you win over enemies and rule the land for ever.\" Thus, hailing Rama who is worshipped by humans as well as gods, was worshipped with auspicious words (by the aforesaid gods, siddhas and charanas).    This is the end of the twenty second sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Perceiving the portents, Rama spoke these words embracing Saumithri who was aware of the portents. \"Lakshmana Arrange a place in this forest where there is cool water and fruits for the battalions of the army, we shall remain (alert).\" \"Dreadful warriors, Bears, monkeys, and Rakshasas will be slain, and I foresee that which bodes destruction of people.\" \"The wind is blowing mixed with dust, even the earth is cracking, mountain tops are shaking, and huge trees are breaking and falling down.\" \"Clouds resembling raw flesh in colour, are making harsh frightening sounds, and rain mixed with drops of blood.\" \"The twilight in red sandal colour is very frightening. The Sun is blazing, raining masses of fire in variegated colours.\" \"The wild animals all over have a piteous look and wailing in low tone standing opposite the Sun is indicating fear.\" \"The moon devoid of glow even in the night is like the Sun with black rays around and red aura behind (the black).\" \"Lakshmana the white Sun is appearing in copper colour around with black colour in the centre which had not been seen before. It is small and dreary.\" \"Lakshmana the stars devoid of brightness are indicating as though it is the time of dissolution of the universe?\" \"The crows, hawks and eagles are falling down like small animals. Also, the jackals are creating fear by making howls.\" \"The earth will turn into a mass of flesh and blood and will be covered by the mountains and tridents hurled by Vanaras and Rakshasas.\" All the Vanaras turning their direction will go immediately and now itself, swiftly to the city ruled by Ravana (said Rama to Lakshmana). Rama, the subduer of enemies in war, a celebrated one having spoken this way proceeded towards Lanka going in front wielding a bow. Then Vibheeshana, Sugriva and all bulls among Vanaras determined in the matter of slaying (the enemies) went roaring. To make Rama happy, the excessively heroic Vanaras made monkey actions. Seeing that Rama felt happy.    This is the end of the twenty third sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The army of Vanaras settled that way by Rama's command shone like the autumnal full moon with auspicious stars. The frightened army (of Vanaras) that was like a tormented ocean started moving swiftly, shaking like the earth. There upon having settled down, the army hordes heard from Lanka terrific and tumultuous noise of drums and percussion instruments that caused horripilation. The leaders of Vanara troops felt very happy at the noise from (Lanka) which they were unable to tolerate and roared louder (than that in joy). Even the Rakshasas heard the roaring of Vanaras in their pride that was bellowing like that of clouds in the sky. Afflicted by sorrow upon seeing the colourful flags and posts of Lanka even Rama's thoughts went about thinking of Sita. The doveeyed Sita is obstructed by Ravana there (at Lanka) like the planet Rohini is caught by the red coloured planet (Mars). Heroic Rama heaving hot and long breath looking at Lakshmana spoke these words that were good for him at that time. \"Lakshmana, you may see the city of Lanka elevated on top of the mountain as though clasping the sky, like the one created in the mind of Vishwakarma.\" \"This Lanka appears splendid with a mass of skyscrapers like white clouds covering the path of Vishnu in the sky.\" \"Lanka is filled with flocks of birds of several kinds singing sweetly, the gardens with charming flowers and fruits are delighting like auspicious gardens of Chaitrara, the garden of Kubera, the god of wealth.\" \"You may see the trees shaking violently by the pleasant breeze, inhabited by proud birds, drunken honeybees and crowded with cuckoos and other birds (Rama said to Lakshmana).\" Dasaratha's son Rama thus talked to Lakshmana in that manner and asked to divide the task of the army in accordance with what is said in sastras. Let the valiant Angada who is difficult to win over, who is a terror to the enemies, take the army along with Nila and remain at the centre (of the army structure). Let Rshaba the bull among Vanaras approach the south side of the army accompanied by his troop of Vanara contingent and remain there. \"Let the mighty Gandhamadana, a difficult one to conquer like a proud elephant, take the battalion of army and stay on the right side\" \"I and Lakshmana will be alert at the head side. Let Jambavan Sushena and the three chiefs of Bears who are strong and quick at sighting remain protecting the belly of the army.\" \"Just as Pracheta who is covered by brilliance, rules the western side of the world, let the king of Vanaras protect the hips and loin portion of the Vanara army.\" The Vanara army force organized that way to protect the Vanaras, shone like the mass of clouds in heaven. Vanaras resolved to go taking peaks of mountains and huge trees to smash Lanka in war. Thus resolved the Vanara leaders in their mind to crush Lanka with its mountain peaks into powder with their bare fists, indeed. Having heard Sugriva, there after splendid Rama spoke thus. \"The army is divided (placed in position). Suka may be relieved.\" Having heard Rama's words Sugriva, the mighty king of Vanaras was happy and relieved the envoy on the instruction of Rama. Relieved by the word of Rama, tormented Suka who was highly terrified returned to the king of Rakshasas. Laughing at Suka, Ravana spoke these words. \"Why are your wings fastened? Your wings have been clipped, it appears!. I suppose you have not fallen under the clutches of the fickle minded Vanaras!\" Laughing at Suka, Ravana spoke these words. \"Why are your wings fastened? Your wings have been clipped, it appears!. I suppose you have not fallen under the clutches of the fickle minded Vanaras!\" Then Suka who was caught by fear, having been asked by the king, trembling away thus replied to the Rakshasa king. \"I went to the northern shore of the ocean and delivered gently the speech just as it was conveyed by you.\" Then Suka who was caught by fear, having been asked by the king, trembling away thus replied to the Rakshasa king. \"I went to the northern shore of the ocean and delivered gently the speech just as it was conveyed by you.\" As soon as they saw me, the enraged Vanaras rising up (into the sky) took hold of me and started injuring me and slaying me. \"O king of Rakshasas! It was not possible to negotiate there with the Vanaras). I had no opportunity to interrogate with them. By nature, Vanaras are violent and are highly furious.\" \"The life of Viradha, Kabhanda and Khara has been taken away by Rama. Accompanied by Sugriva they have set their foot into Lanka for Sita's sake.\" \"Mighty Raghava having crossed the salt sea and reached the shore of Rakshasas, organized them (Vanaras) and stood wielding a bow.\" \"Thousands of army forces of monkeys and Bears resembling mountains and clouds have settled on the ground.\" Alliance is not possible between Rakshasas and army of Bears and Vanaras, just as alliance is not possible between gods and demons. \"They will reach the boundary wall. At once you may do one of the two that I suggest you do. I implore you either to give away Sita or give good battle.\" Angry, redeyed Ravana, having heard Suka's words spoke as though he would burn him with his glance. \"Even if gods, Gandharvas and demons come to wage war with me, even if all the worlds threaten me, I shall not give away Sita.\" \"Just as drunken bees reach the trees with blossoms in spring when will my arrows attack Rama?\" \"When will the glowing arrows from my quiver, that are fit to pierce in thousands, be able to goad Rama like the burning fire sticks goad the elephants?\" \"Just as the rising Sun light obscures the radiance of all (other stars) when will I obscure him surrounded by his army?\" \"I have the speed of the ocean and swiftness like the WindGod. Rama does not know this and desires to wage war with me.\" \"Rama has not seen the poisonous arrows in my quiver in battle. Therefore, he is desiring comb at with me.\" \"He has not known my valour in war. Entering the enemy's army holding my formidable Veena, making challenging sounds with the sharp heads of arrows, causing tumultuous noise like the sound of cry of destitute and frightened ones with iron arrows, I will play the Veena of my bow in hand.\" \"He has not known my valour in war. Entering the enemy's army holding my formidable Veena, making challenging sounds with the sharp heads of arrows, causing tumultuous noise like the sound of cry of destitute and frightened ones with iron arrows, I will play the Veena of my bow in hand.\" \"It is not possible (to win over) for the thousand eyed Indra, or even Varuna, the god presiding over water, or even for Yama, the god of death and again even for Kubera the god of wealth to face the fire of my arrows (said Ravana to Suka).\"    This is the end of the twenty fourth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic, the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing about Rama, the son of Dasaratha crossing the shore of the ocean along with the army, exuberant Ravana spoke to his ministers Suka and Saarana. \"That all the Vanara army together with Rama have crossed the arduous ocean and that the construction of a bridge (is possible) in the sea is not known before.\" \"It is not believable even to me that they constructed a bridge in the sea. Surely I wish to know the size of their army.\" \"Both of you enter Vanara's army without their knowledge and know about the size of the army, of Rama and Sugriva's ministers, of army chiefs who are in the forefront, of the warriors, how they have built bridge in the middle of the sea, about the location of Vanaras and in the same way the efforts and valour of heroes Rama and Lakshmana, I ought to know truly.\" \"Both of you enter Vanara's army without their knowledge and know about the size of the army, of Rama and Sugriva's ministers, of army chiefs who are in the forefront, of the warriors, how they have built bridge in the middle of the sea, about the location of Vanaras and in the same way the efforts and valour of heroes Rama and Lakshmana, I ought to know truly.\" \"Both of you enter Vanara's army without their knowledge and know about the size of the army, of Rama and Sugriva's ministers, of army chiefs who are in the forefront, of the warriors, how they have built bridge in the middle of the sea, about the location of Vanaras and in the same way the efforts and valour of heroes Rama and Lakshmana, I ought to know truly.\" \"Both of you enter Vanara's army without their knowledge and know about the size of the army, of Rama and Sugriva's ministers, of army chiefs who are in the forefront, of the warriors, how they have built bridge in the middle of the sea, about the location of Vanaras and in the same way the efforts and valour of heroes Rama and Lakshmana, I ought to know truly.\" Among those energetic Vanaras, who is the chief of the army? Knowing all these matters, it is fit for you to return quickly. Having accepted the order, both the Rakshasa heroes, Suka and Saarana took the form of Vanaras and entered the Vanara army. There upon both Suka and Saarana did not know the numbers (of the army) at that time as they could not count the numbers from there as it could not be conceived. It caused the raising of their hair. The ocean of army settled on the mountain summits, in caverns and caves, on the shores of the ocean, in the forests and adjoining gardens some who crossed the sea some in the process of crossing settled all over was witnessed by the Rakshasas. It was never ending and making terrific noise.

It was never ending and making terrific noise. Brilliant Vibheeshana saw both Suka and Saarana hidden in the army. He took hold of them and brought to the notice of Rama. \"O conqueror of enemy's citadels! these are spies from Lanka, Suka and Saarana who have come to find us out.\" The two (Rakshasa spies) got worried to look at Rama and also lost hope of their life. Caught up with fear they lifted their palms greeting Rama and expressed these words. \"O noble one! We have come to you assigned by Ravana. O delight of Raghu race, thus we arrived here to know about the entire strength of your army.\" \"On hearing (the spies) Dasaratha's son Rama who remains devoted to the wellbeing of all beings spoke these words smiling at both of them.\" After observing our entire army carefully, acting appropriately (according to Ravana's words) and accomplishing your task you may freely return (said Rama to the spies). \"If you have not seen even a bit, you ought to see. Or else Vibheeshana will show you the total army.\" As you have been caught by us like this you need not have apprehension of your life. Those who do not possess wield or those who are envoys ought not to be slayed. \"Vibheeshana! Even though they are spies seeking to divide the enemy army as both the night rangers have been requesting, you may set them free.\" \"Upon entering the city of Lanka, you may tell my words to the king of Rakshasas, the younger brother of Kubera just as it was told by me.\" \"Let him display the strength on which he has abducted my Sita along with his army and relations at his will.\" At dawn tomorrow, you may see how I will crush the arches of the entrance of Lanka city and the strength of Rakshasas.\" \"Tomorrow at the dawn of the day I will release my dreadful anger on Ravana and even on Rakshasas just as the thunderbolt of Indra was released on Rakshasas.\" Having heard the reply of Rama, both the Rakshasas Suka and Saarana praising Rama saying, \"Victory to you!\" reached Lanka and said to the king of Rakshasas as follows.

(That Ravana) with his throat choked with anger spoke indignantly and harshly to both Suka and Saarana who stood with their heads bent down in supplication. \"It is not proper for those ministers dependent on a capable ruler who has the power to check and hold forth, to speak that which is unpleasant.\" \"Is it appropriate for both of you to praise the enemy this way before war?\" \"You have not grasped that which is the essence of political wisdom in the sastras in spite of waiting upon elders, teachers and parents which was in vain.\" \"Even if you have grasped you have not understood the meaning or out of intensity of your ignorance. Or else I am bearing foolish ones like you who are not fit to be ministers. Out of good luck I am ruling this sovereignty.\" \"Did you not have fear of death when you spoke such harsh words to me, who can by mere order make good or evil to you?\" \"Trees may remain unscathed even on touching forest fire, but those who are punishable do not remain unpunished on account of the king and are treated harshly.\" \"I would have slayed these two sinners who praise the enemy side, if my anger had not softened and remembered their earlier services.\" \"You get away from here, disappear from here. On the contrary since I remember your earlier actions performed by you, I do not wish to kill you. Indeed, both of you are devoid of love and are ungrateful. You stand killed (already).\" Ravana, having spoken that way, both Suka and Saarana felt shy and withdrew from speaking words of praise of Ravana saying, 'Let you be victorious'. Ravana, the tenheaded one, then said to Mahodara who was standing nearby swiftly bring spies who are experts in policy to me. (Ravana) Having said so, Mahodara ordered the spies to approach the king quickly. On reaching they greeted the king with folded hand s promoting h i m to' be victorious' and stood. (Ravana) Having said so, Mahodara ordered the spies to approach the king quickly. On reaching they greeted the king with folded hand s promoting h i m to' be victorious' and stood.

You may come after knowing everything.\" \"Wise kings of the land, having known about enemies from the spies destroy enemies in war with little effort.\" The spies then gladly uttered the words 'be it so', went round the king in reverence and departed with Saardula leading in front. Then the spies circumambulated the great Rakshasa king and having done so went to the place where Rama and Lakshmana were stationed. Reaching the Suvela mountain in disguise, they saw Rama and Lakshmana along with Sugriva and Vibheeshana. Those Rakshasas were bewildered with fear on looking at the army. Righteous Vibheeshana recognized them on seeing them. By chance Vibheeshana seized Saardula, the evil Rakshasa who was moving in that army. As the monkeys attempted to kill him (Saardula), compassionate Rama released him and also the other Rakshasas. Harassed by the valorous and swift Vanaras, those Rakshasas lost their senses and returned to Lanka gasping and panting.",
                "Thereafter, the spies reported to the king of Lanka that Raghava had camped with an unshakable army at the Suvela mountain. On hearing from the spies that Rama has camped with a great army, Ravana got a little panicky and said these words to Saardula. \"O Forest ranger! Your face is not as it should be and also pitiable. Hope the angry enemies have not done anything to you.\" And there after questioned by him (Ravana) Saardula revealed these words overwhelmed by fear, in faint tone to the tiger among Rakshasas. \"O King! the Vanara heroes are valiant and highly powerful. They are also protected by Rama. It is not possible to spy on them.\" \"It is not possible to converse with them or to question and or to examine, since they are guarded all over by mountains like Vanaras.\" \"No sooner I entered their army, I was detected. I was forcibly seized by their guards and rolled on the ground.\" \"The monkeys had beaten me with fists, bitten my palms with teeth, beaten me intensely and paraded me in the army indignantly.\" \"With all my limbs wet with bleeding, control over senses lost, after parading, I was led to the assembly of Rama.\" \"While smitten by the monkeys, offering salutation with folded hands, and pleading for protection from Raghava, luckily, I am alive.\" \"Having filled the great ocean with rocks and stones in that way, taking position at the entrance of Lanka Rama stands equipped with arms.\" \"O glorious King! After releasing me, Rama is advancing into Lanka surrounded by mountains like a monkey army in the form of Garuda.\" \"Before Rama reaches the boundary, the wall, do one thing quickly. Either give away Sita or set out to give a good war.\" \"Having heard what has been said by Saardula, Rakshasa king reviewed in his mind and made a good statement before Saardula.\" \"Even if Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas come to wage war with me and even if I have threats from all worlds, I will not give away Sita.\" Glorious Ravana having spoken like that, again said (to Saardula), \"You moved about in the army (camp) there. Tell me who among the monkeys are warriors?\" \"Gentle Saardula! Of those who are difficult to encounter, what is their description? Who are the powerful ones among them? Whose sons and grandsons, are they? You may speak.\" \"Likewise knowing their strengths and weaknesses from you I wish to know what to do. It is essential to know their numbers and strength before the war.\" \"When Ravana had spoken that way, good spy Saardula proceeded to tell these words in the presence of Ravana.\" \"Certainly, king Sugriva, the son of Rksharaja's, is difficult to be conquered in battle. Here is the son of Gadgada, famously called as Jambavan.\" Another son of Gadgada is Dhumra. One who killed many Rakshasas is Hanuman, the son of Kesari, who is the son of Brhaspati. \"O king!

                "There upon the spies described the unshakeable army of Raghava staying at Suvela mountain, to the king of Lanka. Having heard from the spies that Rama has come with mighty force, Ravana got perturbed and said to the ministers. \"The time has come for us to call for all the rakshasas and ministers immediately and assemble (said Ravana).\" Having been ordered (by Ravana) that way, the ministers along with Rakshasas instantly reached and he started to think with them. Thereafter, thinking about what is appropriate to do, unassailable Ravana dispensed his ministers and entered his own residence. Then Ravana of extraordinary skills sent for Vidyujihvam, a learned one in conjuring tricks and went from there to Mythili. Rakshasa king Ravana said to Vidyujihvam who knew conjuring tricks, \"We will cheat Sita, daughter of Janaka by a trick.\" \"O Night ranger! You make an illusory head of Raghava and come and stand at me holding an arrow with great bow.\" When the Rakshasa king had spoken that way to Vidyujihvam, he said, \"Be it so.\" Pleased with the dexterous production of Vidyujihvam, Ravana presented to him a beautiful ornament. Eager to have a look at Sita, the mighty king of Rakshasas entered Asoka grove. Thereafter, the younger brother of Kubera (Ravana) saw sad Sita, who did not deserve that piteous condition, who had been reduced to sorrowful state, seated on the ground in Asoka grove, with her head bent down filled with sorrow contemplating on her husband alone. Thereafter, the younger brother of Kubera (Ravana) saw sad Sita, who did not deserve that piteous condition, who had been reduced to sorrowful state, seated on the ground in Asoka grove, with her head bent down filled with sorrow contemplating on her husband alone. While she was guarded by dreadful Rakshasa women surrounding her closely, Ravana went near her happily and saw her. He addressed Sita praising her. \"O Auspicious one! However, much I have requested you, you did not care for me seeking your husband. Raghava, who killed Khara, has been killed in war.\" \"O Sita! All your roots have been crushed by me. Give up your vanity. By your own accord, you become my wife.\" \"O Foolish one! Give up these thoughts from your mind. What will you do with your deceased husband? O auspicious one! You are the queen of all my wives.\" \"O woman of less merit! You are one who has given up all worldly actions. Stupid one! You pretend as if you know everything. O Sita! Hear about your husband 's death like that of Vrthasura.\" \"Raghava led by the huge army force of the Vanara king has arrived on the seashore.\" And when the Sun moved towards the west, Rama encamped on the northern shore of the sea with a huge army to strike. After having walked all the way they slept well and when they were sleeping at midnight, we found out all about them by sending prime spies. \"There in that camp Lakshmana and Rama are killed by my powerful army led by Prahastha at night.\" Again, and again lifting spears, iron bars, javelins, huge staffs, sparkling maces, shining iron mallets and clubs, lances and strong Musalas, the Rakshasas hurled at Vanaras. Again, and again lifting spears, iron bars, javelins, huge staffs, sparkling maces, shining iron mallets and clubs, lances and strong Musalas, the Rakshasas hurled at Vanaras. \"There after the head of Rama, who was sleeping, was severed by Prahastha, skilled at striking, with a big sword without any feeling of attachment.\" \"When Vibheeshana rose up he was caught by chance. Lakshmana and Vanaras fled in all directions.\" \"O Sita! Vanara Lord Sugriva with his neck broken, Hanuman with chin broken were killed by Rakshasas and are lying down fallen on the ground.\" And while Jambavan was rising on his knees, he was struck by many iron bars in comb at and had fallen down like a tree. \"Mainda and Dwivida of huge bodies, who are slayers of enemies, the bulls among Vanaras are breathing hard, and bathed in blood roaring, having been cutin the middle of their body.\" \"Mainda and Dwivida of huge bodies, who are slayers of enemies, the bulls among Vanaras are breathing hard, and bathed in blood roaring, having been cutin the middle of their body.\" \"Panasa is lying down on earth like jackfruit.

Darimukha is lying down shattered by many arrows. Brilliant Kumuda too is torn off and silently lying down.\" \"By the many arrows of Rakshasas reaching towards Angada, he lies down chopped up and destroyed, with his armlets dropped down throwing up blood.\" \"There, some of the sleeping Vanaras were crushed by elephants, so also, just as by the speed of wind the clouds are crushed the Vanaras are crushed to death.\" \"Some were followed behind as they were speeding like lions and mighty elephants afflicted and frightened, struck by Rakshasas.\" \"While a few Vanaras dived into the sea, some took refuge in the sky. Resorting to their natural way the Bears climbed the trees.\" \"Many fierceeyed Rakshasas killed several Vanaras on the shore of the ocean, in the mountains and woods.\" \"In that way the army of your husband has been killed by Rakshasa army and his decayed head drenched in blood covered with dust has been brought.\" Then Ravana, the highly unassailable king of Rakshasas spoke these words to the hearing of Sita. \"Bring that Rakshasa, Vidyujihvam of cruel deeds who brought Rama's head from the battlefield.\" Then holding the head along with the bow, Vidyujihvam bowed his head down in salutation and stood in front of Ravana. Then the king, Ravana spoke to Vidyujihvam, the Rakshasa with extended tongue, who stood close by. At once place the head of Dasaratha's son before that piteous woman. Let her see the ultimate status attained by her husband at the end (said Ravana). Having spoken immediately placed the head of Rama that was pleasing to see, by the side of Sita and went away. Thus addressed Ravana casting down the bright great bow that is famous in the three worlds. \"Prahastha has brought this bow duly tied with the string after killing human Rama in the night.\"",
                "On seeing the esteemed Rama's head and bow, remembering the description made by Hanuman about the friendship with Sugriva thinking of the eyes, complexion of the face, the hair, and curls of her husband at the end Sita recognized the auspicious Chudamani. Identifying all those marks to be like Rama's she felt very sad and cried like a deer and abused Kaikeyi.

You, who are given to creating quarrel have ruined the race.\" \"Kaikeyi, you have given bark robes to prince Rama and sent him to the forest with me. What harm has he done for you? Thinking of this again and again Sita cried.\" That miserable young, Vaidehi, having said so, fell on the ground trembling like a cut off banana plant. Broadeyed Sita, regaining her consciousness after a while, sat close to the head of Rama and lamented. \"O mightyarmed one! Alas you are killed while following heroic vow. I live to see you in the last state of your life, widowed. I am done.\" \"O Rama, you are faithful to your vows, a noble one! It is said that because of a woman's faults, the husband will die. It is not even so as you died in front of a virtuous woman of good conduct.\" \"I am in grief and filled with an ocean of sorrow. You who have come to save me and are also killed.\" \"O Raghava! Even my motherinlaw Kausalya is separated from her dear son just as cow is separated from calf.\" \"O Raghava of incomprehensible valour! the words predicted by astrologers that your life is long is falsified. Your life has been short.\" \"Or else, even the wisdom of a learned one is diffused and lost perhaps! the effect of time which is the cause of all living beings has caused this.\" \"You are the knower of all sastras, and capable of warding off all calamities. How did death have a chance to meet you and overtake?\" \"O lotuseyed Rama! After you have lost contact with me, the most horrible cruel night has killed you cutting you off from me.\" \"O mightyarmed one! A bull among men and a noble one, you are embracing the earth as though it is your beloved and sleeping leaving me in the sky.\" \"O Hero! This bow that was decorated with gold was always worshipped with sandal and flowers diligently by you and me with utmost devotion.\" \"O Sinless one! Surely you have reached heaven where your father, my fatherinlaw Dasaratha and your grandfathers have reached.\" \"In heaven, you will be seeing luminaries of the sky who are dear, who have done great deeds and earned merit and the royal sages of your own race.\" \"O King! I have come to you while I was young. I am your companion and wife also. Why are you not seeing me? Why are you not talking to me?\" \"O Kakutstha! while you held my hand (at the time of marriage) you promised that you will be with me and likewise promised to take me, a (wretched one) with you to the other world. Remembering that I am sad.\" \"O Jewel among those who attained good state! Why have you gone abandoning me dear? To which world have you gone from here? I am pained by your deserting me.\" \"This body which used to be decorated by me with auspicious items, with great respect is dragged by cruel animals.\" \"Why are you, who performed all kinds of sacrificial rituals of fire with all offerings deserve sanctification without doing fire sacrifice?\" \"Seeing only Lakshmana returning, of the three exiled, Kausalya will be immersed in grief (will ask).\" \"When she questions, he may tell that you and your army were killed by the army of friends at night.\" \"Raghava! Hearing that you were killed while asleep and I was taken to the home of Rakshasas, Kausalya will not be able to survive with a broken heart.\" \"On account of an undeserving one, Rama, the son of the emperor, a valiant one who does not deserve to be killed, after having crossed the ocean is killed by a footprint of a cow(easily).\" \"In ignorance as an obloquy of his race, the noble son of Dasaratha married me. For such Rama's wife turned out to be his death.\" \"Undoubtedly I may have obstructed a supreme offering (such as offering a girl in marriage) in some other (previous) life. So now I am pained even though I am the wife of one who is kind to all.\" \"O Ravana! You may quickly join me with my husband as it will be highly auspicious for the wife to join the husband.\" \"O Ravana! Join my head with his and my body with his body. I will follow him in the same way.\" Burning in sorrow, the broad eyed Sita gazing at the head of her husband and the bow again and again lamented. While Sita was wailing in that manner, as said earlier, the Rakshasa guarding her approached the king and offered salutations with both hands. The Rakshasa (guard) greeted the king saying, \"Let you be victorious!\" and announced reverentially, \"Prahastha, the army chief has arrived.\" \"O Lord! Accompanied by all ministers Prahastha is waiting and sends me desiring to see you.\" \"O great king, endowed with forgiveness and royalty! there is a little urgent work. Undoubtedly, they are waiting to see you please.\" On hearing the submission of the rakshasa, the tenheaded king left the Asoka grove to see the ministers. Having known all about Rama's prowess, Ravana and ministers entered the assembly to think carefully about the task to be carried out and how to do it. As soon as Ravana departed, that head and the excellent bow vanished from there. The king of Rakshasas and the ministers of terrific valour then thought about the course of action to be taken against Rama and decided. The Rakshasa king who resembled the god of death spoke to the heads of army force and wellwishers who stood close by. \"Break forth by beating the drums with powerful drumsticks calling the army to assemble without telling the reason.\" Then the attendants collected the great powerful army saying, 'so be it', to Ravana who was desirous of war.

Then Saarana of sweet expression, comforted Sita who was put off and was extremely sorrowful because of the Rakshasa king. Most compassionate Saarana, determined to protect was friendly with Sita while she was ordered for protecting her by Ravana. Saarana saw her friend Sita, who had lost consciousness, fully covered by dust by rolling on the dirty ground like a female horse. Saarana consoled Vaidehi of noble vows in a friendly way and encouraged her to recover saying, \"Let there be no pain at heart.\" \"O Broadeyed friend! You are constantly under fear (timid). Give up fear of Ravana, I have overheard all that you have spoken to Ravana and his reply by hiding in a secret place out of my affection, without caring for my life.\" \"O Broadeyed friend! You are constantly under fear (timid). Give up fear of Ravana, I have overheard all that you have spoken to Ravana and his reply by hiding in a secret place out of my affection, without caring for my life.\" \"O Mythili! I know all about why the king of Rakshasas returned back agitated.\" \"Rama is a knower of his Self. It is not possible to kill him while he is asleep. Nay death is not possible for he is a tiger among men.\" \"Vanaras are fighting with trees and are not capable of being killed. Just as the gods are protected by their Lord Indra, Vanaras are protected by Rama. It is not feasible to kill them.\" \"O Sita! One who is endowed with long rounded arms and broad chest, a valorous one, a glorious wielder of bow and powerful Rama along with his brother Lakshmana, is always a protector of himself and all surrounding him. He is a knower of sastras of propriety. Raghava is majestic with inconceivable courage and a destroyer of foes. He will not be killed.\" \"O Sita!

He will not be killed.\" \"On account of his perverse thought and being inimical to all beings Ravana a tricker has attempted a trick at you in anger.\" \"Your sorrow has gone. All auspiciousness awaits you. Surely you will attain good fortune (Lakshmi). You listen to my happy and pleasant news.\" \"Rama accompanied by Vanara army has crossed the ocean and reached the southern shore of the ocean.\" \"Rama, a fully accomplished soul accompanied by Lakshmana together with army stands protected by the army and is stationed on the seashore.\" \"These swift footed Rakshasas sent by the king brought the news of Rama crossing the sea.\" \"O Broadeyed Sita! On hearing the news (of Rama crossing) Rakshasa king is holding consultation with ministers about what to do.\" While Saarana was speaking to Sita, frightening sounds of the army making all kinds of attempts were heard. On hearing the loud sounds of army maces, rods, and drums, Saarana looked at Sita and spoke these sweet words. \"O Timid Sita! Listen to the deep penetrating sounds of drums like the rumbling of rain clouds signifying the preparations of the army.\" \"Elephants in rut are being decorated, charioteers are getting ready for war in thousands and discharging darts from hands and laughing loudly.\" \"See the weird appearance of footsoldiers collected here and therein groups prepared to go. The royal path is filled with choking sounds of the troops moving fast, like an ocean filled with streams of water. It is strange.\" \"Look at the sheen of weapons, the leather shields, spreading forth different pleasing colours, the brightness of which resembles the burning of forest fire arisen and spread in summer. And here are chariots, horses and elephants decked with ornaments following Ravana, as well as the powerful Rakshasa army full of joy.\" \"Look at the sheen of weapons, the leather shields, spreading forth different pleasing colours, the brightness of which resembles the burning of forest fire arisen and spread in summer.

Listen to the flourish of the trumpets. The happy Rakshasas are making tumultuous noise causing horripilation.\" \"Listen to the bustle of noise of the Rakshasas lifting the weapons, ringing of the bells (of elephants), and rattling of chariots, and neighing of horses.

Your husband, the lotuspetal eyed Rama whose prowess is inconceivable like that of Indra who vanquished Daityas will come and kill Ravana and win you back.\" \"Your fire of anger will be gone. Your husband, the lotuspetal eyed Rama whose prowess is inconceivable like that of Indra who vanquished Daityas will come and kill Ravana and win you back.\" \"Your husband accompanied by Lakshmana will exhibit his valour against Rakshasas just as Indra did against enemies accompanied by Vishnu (descended as his younger brother).\" \"When the enemy is killed, and your objective is accomplished, I shall behold you mounted on the lap of Rama.\" \"Virtuous Sita! Hugged by your broad chested Rama, you will shed tears of joy on his bosom.\" \"O Sita! God like lady! Mighty Rama will soon release your single plait hanging up to hind part for many months before.\" \"God like Lady! Beholding the face of Sri Rama whose face is like a just risen full moon, you will cast off tears of sorrow just as a female snake sets its slough free.\" \"O divine Mythili! Killing Ravana in war before long, your beloved who deserves to be happy will be happy in the company of his beloved.\" \"Just as the earth becomes green with crops blessed with good monsoon, so also you will become joyful by seeing the great soul Rama's heroism.\"",
                "Thus, Sita's agony was put off by Saarana's consoling words and Sita was glad just as the parched earth was delighted with shower of rain. Then Saarana who knew the right time to do so, wishing the welfare of her dear friend Sita and desirous of doing anything for her smiled before she started speaking. \"Darkeyed Sita! I am eager to go (to Rama's presence) and communicate your welfare and message. I can return back hidden (from Ravana's view).\" \"While I fly through the sky without any support, either the wind god or even Garuda will not be capable of following my movement.\" When Saarana was telling Sita in that way, Sita's face which was earlier filled with tears became pleasant and she spoke again. \"You are capable of flying through the sky or even going to the underworld. For my sake you will do what cannot be done also and that it is your bounden duty, is also known to me.\" \"In my opinion, your duty for me is to go and find out what Ravana is doing now, if you are firmly resolved.\" \"Ravana has the power of conjuring tricks, makes enemies cry. He is cruel, evil minded and deluding me as though he has drunk liquor.\" \"He, that Ravana makes even the frightful Rakshasa care takers threaten me and reproach me repeatedly every day.\" \"I am perturbed and doubtful (of my life). My mind is not at ease. Even though I am in Ashoka Grove I am disturbed.\" \"Indeed, please tell me certainly in toot, whatever decision that enemy takes and everything. Be kind to me and tell.\" Saarana who speaks sweetly, kept wiping Sita's face covered with tears gently and replied in this manner. \"Janaki! If you think so, I shall go to Ravana secretly and find out his intention and return back.\" Having said so to Sita, she (Saarana) moved closer (to Ravana) and heard Ravana's conversation with his ministers. Having heard and known the intention of evilminded Ravana, she (Saarana) quickly reached the beautiful Ashoka grove. On entering the Ashoka grove, she saw the daughter of Janaka eagerly waiting for her every moment, looking like Lord Vishnu's wife Lakshmi, who lost her lotus seat. On seeing the kind Saarana returning, Sita was very glad. She embraced her and offered a seat herself. \"Seated here happily reveals to me truly that cruel and evil minded Ravana's intention.\" To the trembling Sita, Saarana narrated totally all the discussion Ravana had with the ministers. \"O Vaidehi! Ravana's mother Kaikasi and the aged minister Aviddha advised the Lord of Rakshasas to release you.\" \"Let Mythili be given back to the ruler of the people (Rama) offering good hospitality. The (killing of fourteen thousand Rakshasas) amazing performance at Janasthana by Rama should serve as sufficient proof to you (of the consequences).\" \"Crossing the ocean, reaching Lanka, seeing Sita and killing Rakshasas in comb at was done by Hanuman. Which man can do this on earth?\" \"Even though his mother and aged minister counselled Ravana, he is like a miser holding on treasure not inclined to set you free.\" \"O Mythili! Ravana is not interested in liberating you unless he goes to the other world in combat. (It can't happen when he is alive) This is certain. There is no doubt about this.\" \"This thought has come to him only to cause him death. Because of impending death, he is very steady in his mind. This Ravana will not be able to liberate you before his death and of the Rakshasas.\" \"Rama will kill Ravana in war with his sharp arrows and take you back to Ayodhya, O darkeyed lady!\" In the meantime (while Saarana was telling Sita) the sounds of drums and conchs combined with the clamour of Vanara troops was heard and it was as though the surface of the earth was shaking. On hearing the sounds of Vanara troops, the Rakshasas present in Lanka became dull, overcome by depression, thinking that because of Ravana's mistakes they could not see any good prospects for them.    This is the end of the thirty fourth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by Valmiki.",
                "The mighty armed Rama, the conqueror of enemy cities, Raghava marched forth with the noise of the blowing of conches and the sounds of drums. Ravana, the Lord of Rakshasas, looked at his ministers on hearing the sounds and reflecting for a moment. Thereafter the mighty Lord of Rakshasas, a cruel one, a scourge of the world addressed the assembly of his ministers and spoke abusing them. \"You have told me about the valour of Hanuman the messenger of Rama and his prowess in crossing the ocean which I heard just now.\" \"Even though you are truly valorous in war, on knowing Rama's prowess, you are standing mute looking at each other. I know that.\" Then, Malyavan the maternal grandfather of Ravana, a very wise Rakshasa indeed said this on hearing Ravana's statement. \"O king! Whoever is well versed in all the fourteen sciences and is a follower of justice, he alone wins over enemies and rules the kingdom for long.\" \"Continuing to act in that way in course of time a king who encounters his enemies and expands his own side, enjoys great sovereignty.\" \"When a king is losing strength, he should join hand s with the enemy who is equal to him. He should not disrespect the enemy but quit his hostility and join him (if the enemy is more powerful).\" \"O Ravana! Joining with that Rama is agreeable to me. Let that Sita for whose sake you have been attacked be restored to him.\" All the celestial sages and Gandharvas are wishing him victory. Therefore, do not have enmity. Making an alliance with him is desirable for you. \"The divine Brahma, the grandfather of the universe created two orders, deities and devils. They took the refuge of virtues and vices respectively.\" \"The great souls were towards righteousness and Rakshasas took the side of unrighteousness.\" \"When moral merit destroys unrighteousness, it is called Krtayuga. So also, when virtue gets eclipsed by unrighteousness, it is called Kaliyuga.\" \"While you were ranging in all the worlds, you gave up righteousness and embraced unrighteousness. Therefore, the enemy who is righteous is stronger than you.\" \"You are nourishing unrighteousness mistakenly. Therefore, it is going to swallow us. It has become the cause for the divine celestial side to become powerful.\" \"Being engaged in matters of sense pleasures you have created great agitation(disturbance) in the minds of the seers (engaged in penance) who resemble gods of burning fire.\" \"Their power is difficult to overcome as they are pure souls and blazing like fire by their austerity. They follow virtues faithfully intending to acquire merit like brahmanas. They are standing firmly curbing their senses doing sacrifices offering oblations into sacrificial fires following tradition.

They are crying most frightfully.\" \"Women of dark colour like coal with yellow teeth are speaking unpleasant things standing before us in dreams laughing heartily.\" \"In the houses, food offerings made for gods are eaten by dogs, donkeys are procreating cows and rats of mongoose.\" \"Cats are having the company of (mating) Leopards, pigs are mating with dogs, Kinneras with Rakshasas as well as human beings also.\" \"The white and redfooted doves are moving about impelled by time spirit boding destruction of Rakshasas.\" \"Minas living in households grappling with bellicose birds in delight are falling down dead.\" All birds and animals are making hostile noise.

                "The tenheaded Ravana, having fallen under the sway of death could not tolerate Malyavatha's words of advice. Then Ravana who had come under the influence of anger, knitting the brows of his face rolling his eyes said to Malyavan. \"Harsh and not wellmeaning words have been uttered by you taking the enemy's side. I will not listen to what you said earlier.\" \"For what reason do you say that a wretched human being, alone, forsaken by a father who has taken asylum in the forest, who is taking the help of vanaras is capable?\" \"The Lord of Rakshasas is a terror to all including the Devas and am endowed with all kinds of prowess and efficiency. Why do you think I am deficient?\" \"I suspect that out of hatred towards me, you are speaking such harsh words to a hero encouraged by the enemy.\" \"Which person who has learned the truth of sastras will address such harsh words to one in power without instigation?\" \"Sita who is like Lakshmi without the lotus has been brought from the forest. Why would I return her for the fear of Rama?\" \"Indeed, in a short while crores of Vanaras, Sugriva and also Lakshmana and Raghava will be killed by me. Oh!\" As even gods will not with stand Ravana in war, of whom Ravana will be afraid of in a duel. \"I would break my head into two also but not bend my head to anyone. It is my weakness. It is hard to overcome nature.\" \"Rama has constructed a bridge by chance and because of that you are fearing what wonder is there in it?\" \"Rama having crossed the sea with his Vanara army will not go back with life. It is true.\" When Ravana was abashed and speaking in that way realizing that he is angry, Malyavan did not reply feeling shy. Malyavan offered blessings to the king for success in accordance with tradition left to his house. Ravana then held discussions with his companions and ministers and made unequalled arrangements for (safety of) Lanka. Ravana posted Prahastha surrounded by many Rakshasas at the east gate, and the Rakshasas of great prowess, Mahaparsva and Mahodara at the southern gate, and like that Mahamaya and Indrajith, his own son at the western gate. Ravana posted Prahastha surrounded by many Rakshasas at the east gate, and the Rakshasas of great prowess, Mahaparsva and Mahodara at the southern gate, and like that Mahamaya and Indrajith, his own son at the western gate. Ravana posted Suka and Sarana at the north gate of Lanka and himself reached there and told the ministers that he would be there. In the middle of the city, he placed Virupaksha, a Rakshasa endowed with extraordinary strength and many more Rakshasas. The best of Rakshasas under the sway of destiny, having been ordered in that way in Lanka, Ravana felt as though he had accomplished the task. There after making arrangements adequately for the protection of Lanka, taking leave of ministers who offered blessings for his prosperity and uttered words of benediction for his success Ravana entered the inner chambers of the palace.

It appears that this city is unconquerable to Devas, demons and Gandharvas also by the immortals.\" \"Rakshasa king Ravana is ever present here. Prepare yourself to achieve success in the mission and determine your duty.\" While they were speaking like that to one another, Ravana's brother Vibheeshana spoke courteously, words full of meaning. \"My ministers Anala, Sarabha, Sampathi and also Praghasa went to Lanka and saw it and returned.\" All of them assumed the form of birds and went deep into Lanka, saw the enemy strength and arrangements made by the enemy and turned up. \"Rama!

For the sake of assisting one Rakshasa in war ten lakhs of Rakshasas are staying at his service.\" Mighty armed Vibheeshana revealed to Rama all the information that was told to him by ministers. Again, Vibheeshana, the prosperous brother of Ravana, spoke to Rama everything about Lanka made known to him by the ministers. Vibheeshana looking at the lotus petal eyed Rama, intending to please Rama, spoke. \"Rama!

The best of vanaras saw dark coloured rakshasas who stood like another boundary in a row. All the vanaras saw the rakshasas eager for war, and as Rama stood looking at them many kinds of clamours were heard. Thereafter the Sun had set in, and twilight reddened.

                "The heroic leader of the monkeys kept awake that night on the Suvela and saw forests and gardens there in Lanka. They were amazed to see the even terrain, beautiful and expansive, long, and continuous sanctuary lovely to look at being a feast to the eyes. Thickly covered with trees like Champaka, Asoka, Punnaga, Sala, Tala, Samala and Tamala trees concealing the woods, surrounded with Nagamala trees all over  and Hintala, Arjuna and Neepa in full bloom, Saptaparni, Tilaka, Karnakara and Patala trees with crests laden with flowers, intertwined with creepers and wonderful variety of flowers trees with tender red leaves as if clothe d in red, flowers of diverse kind and similarly colourful Neela and Sadala as king of forest, it was shining like Amaravathi, capital of Indra.

Having reached there where trees bore fragrance, very beautiful flowers and fruits seemed as though humans were wearing ornaments. Appearing like the chaitra chariot of Kubera, Nandana garden of Indra, green in all seasons filled with bees, the garden was a wonderful delight. The Vanaras heard the singing of cuckoos, dancing of peacocks, crying of gallinules, lapwings and herons from the gardens abounding in cascades. There after the rejoiced heroic Vanaras who can change their form at will happily entered the woods and gardens inhabited by birds in heat full of emotion, trees covered with cuckoos, and wandering bees, rendered noisy by birds, resounded with the singing of large black bees and bees going around clinging to trees, mingled with sounds of various birds and noise of cries of cranes.

Then the Vanaras of extraordinary energy, were enjoying the breeze redolent with the fragrance of flowers as they were entering, and the wind blew. Some other monkey heroes permitted by Sugriva went to Lanka decorated with flags. Other monkeys capable of roaring went into Lanka, spreading out terrifying the birds, dispiriting the deer and elephants by noise. Those Vanaras endowed with speed went trampling down on the ground with force, the dust under their feet rose to the sky in a fraction of a second. Alarmed by that sound the Bears, lions, pigs, elephants, buffaloes were frightened and went in all the ten directions. Trikuta peak was fully covered with flowers, sparkled with gold, spread over a hundred yojanas, beautiful to look at, splendid and smooth. It is difficult even for birds to reach, for sages even in thought and difficult to access by any physical action. It is praiseworthy as if touching the sky alone.

It is difficult even for birds to reach, for sages even in thought and difficult to access by any physical action. It is praiseworthy as if touching the sky alone. Lanka ruled by Ravana was a hundred yojanas in breadth and thirty yojanas in length was seen. The city of Lanka looked charming with tall towers resembling white cluster of clouds fortified with gold and silver. The tall buildings decorated beautifully resembled air planes and were shining like heavy rainy clouds exposed to the sun. The building in the centre resembled the abode of Vishnu. In that city, which was always protected fully by a hundred Rakshasas, there was a palace with thousand pillars, which looked like peak of mount Kailas, and was as though it was scraping the sky and it as like an ornament of Lanka, the city of Rakshasa's Lord.

Prosperous Rama, brother of Lakshmana along with Vanaras saw different kinds of forests, mountains filled with different kinds of minerals, delightful gardens endowed with different varieties of flowers, charming birds singing happily, frequented by a variety of deer, attended by Rakshasas.

                "Rama accompanied by Vanara troop and Sugriva, ascended the peak of Suvela mountain spread over yojanas. Remaining there for a short while, Rama observed the view of Lanka in all directions. He saw Lanka built on the charming peak of Trikuta strongly by Vishwakarma, endowed with delightful groves. From there Rama saw on the peak of the tower the Rakshasa king, who is difficult to approach. He was fanned by white whisks on both sides, graced with triumphal parasol, decorated his body with red sandal paste, adorned in redcoloured ornaments, resembling dark clouds, attired in red like the hare's blood, embroidered with golden thread, with scars on his chest caused by indentations made by the tusks of Airavata the elephant of Indra, looked like a mass of cloud covered by sunshine at dusk.

Looking at the sight of Raghava seeing Rakshasa king, Sugriva the king of Vanaras got up instantly rashly. Provoked by anger, courageous and strong Sugriva rose up impelled by impetuosity and flew to the peak of the tower. For a moment he stood looking at the ogre fearlessly in his mind and treating him like straw spoke harsh words. \"O Rakshasa! I am a friend and servant of the king of kings, ruler of the world. By his power I will not leave you!\", Sugriva said. Having spoken thus, Sugriva got up speedily and flew to the top of the tower (here Ravana was located) held the diadem and pushed it on the ground. Observing Sugriva coming towards him, Ravana said, \"When you were not seen by me you had a neck. I will make you neckless.\" Telling like that that Ravana got up and threw Sugriva by his hand s to the ground. Then Sugriva getting up like a ball fallen pushed Ravana down. Sugriva and Ravana, their bodies sweating all over, bodies coloured red with blood looking like red silk cotton trees, their bodies clinging together interlocked with each other stood motionless. They were fighting with their fists, palms and blows of forearms, hurting each other with nails and carrying out unbearable forms of war. Sugriva and Ravana, their bodies sweating all over, bodies coloured red with blood looking like red silk cotton trees, their bodies clinging together interlocked with each other stood motionless. They were fighting with their fists, palms and blows of forearms, hurting each other with nails and carrying out unbearable forms of war. Violently fighting like that aggressively for long, throwing each other down repeatedly, bending and moving their feet in a direction, stood on the fl at area of the peak in the middle portion. Squeezing their bodies of each other they dropped down between the boundary of the peak and the moat. They were gasping heavily for a moment and clung their body to each other jumping. Both pressing their bosom to each other, clung to each other, and fastened themselves in embrace in the comb at having received similar training in war and both endowed with might. At this time, they went on in comb at using several war methods. Both of them resembled a tiger and lion affected by pride, connecting to each other through their shoulders like Lordly elephants, hitting and hurting one another holding one another fell down at once simultaneously. Both of them were holding one another, snubbing each other gradually following many kinds of combat. As both the heroes were well trained in wrestling and fighting, they did not feel tiresome. Both Ravana and Sugriva endowed with mighty arms, were resisting each other, and keeping away one another engaging in comb at for a long time. They kept on moving, going around each other swiftly. Both of them intent on destroying each other were approaching one another and now and then growling like cats for the sake of food. Both Vanara king and Ravana being learned in war craft, went around in circles like ox's urine, stood in different wonderful postures, moved forward and backward horizontally and obliquely to evade movements, hitting, and delivering each other, standing steadily motionless, striking, jumping, assaulting each other coming forward and going away, going backwards jumping from behind, holding hands and folding to resist exhibiting their skill in combat.

In the meantime, Ravana thought of exhibiting his superiority by jugglery and jumped to the sky. Knowing that Sugriva, the untiring Vanara king assumed the air of victor and rose up to the sky. Baffled Ravana stood thinking Sugriva would come there. In the meantime, Ravana thought of exhibiting his superiority by jugglery and jumped to the sky.

Then Sugriva, the Sun god's son, the Lord of Vanara chiefs, who had won fame of winning in battles, victorious exhausting Ravana in comb at flying the extensive sky reached Rama who was amid Vanara army. Sugriva the son of the Sun god, having completed the feat, rejoiced by increasing the joy of foremost of Raghus. Then he who is adored by the monkey chiefs entered the army of Vanaras.    This is the end of the fortieth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, brother of Lakshmana, seeing the signs of war, embraced Sugriva and spoke these words. \"You have done this courageous feat without consulting me. Rulers do not do such actions.\" \"O hero, who is fond of daring actions! To me, to the army and Vibheeshana you created a great doubt by this bold action of yours.\" \"O broad shouldered hero, tamer of foes! Do not do this kind of action. Even if you were harmed a bit, O destroyer of foes, of what use is it to me or even to Sita, Bharata, Satrughna or to Lakshmana or even to my body?\" \"O broad shouldered hero, tamer of foes! Do not do this kind of action. Even if you were harmed a bit, O destroyer of foes, of what use is it to me or even to Sita, Bharata, Satrughna or to Lakshmana or even to my body?\" \"Mighty Sugriva! You resemble Indra and Varuna in might. Your valour is known to me. I have decided in my mind to kill the sons of Ravana and his relatives in battle, coronate Vibheeshana in Lanka, and hand over the kingdom to Bharata and give up my body.\" \"Mighty Sugriva! You resemble Indra and Varuna in might. Your valour is known to me. I have decided in my mind to kill the sons of Ravana and his relatives in battle, coronate Vibheeshana in Lanka, and hand over the kingdom to Bharata and give up my body.\" To Rama who was speaking in that manner, Sugriva replied, \"Heroic Rama! Seeing that Ravana, who has borne away your consort, and knowing my own strength, how can I tolerate?\" To Rama who was speaking in that manner, Sugriva replied, \"Heroic Rama! Seeing that Ravana, who has borne away your consort, and knowing my own strength, how can I tolerate?\" Raghava heard the hero Sugriva, applauding him and spoke these words to Lakshmana, who was endowed with prosperity. \"Lakshmana! We should occupy a region with cool water and good fruits and plan to divide the army and be ready.\" \"I foresee the terrific destruction of eminent heroes among Bears, monkeys and Rakshasas. I see the danger approaching.\" \"The winds are blowing severely, the earth is quaking in, the mountain peaks are shaking, and the elephants bearing the earth (in the four corners) are falling.\" \"The fierce clouds resembling wild birds are making terrible harsh sounds and rain mixed with drops of blood is showering.\" \"The twilight appears like red sander trees, the burning fire falling from the sun is like a mass of fire and frightening.\" \"The desperate inauspicious sounds of ominous beasts crying pitifully facing the sun are causing great fear.\" \"Like at the time of universal dissolution, the moon is not radiant, being surrounded by black and red halo at night and is tormenting.\" \"Lakshmana! Short dark spot observed in the Sun 's orbit is inauspicious. moon is surrounded by copper colour and dreary.\" \"Just as the spots on the moon, the stars are also dirty and not visible. It forebodes the end of the universe Lakshmana!\" \"The crows, hawks and also vultures are joining lowly animals like jackals and making loud noises which is inauspicious and not good.\" \"The land will remain covered by rocks, tridents, swords hurled by the Vanaras and Rakshasas and with flesh and blood.\" Mighty hero Rama, (the elder brother of Lakshmana) said to Lakshmana in this manner (as described earlier) and descended from the peak of the mountain without delay. Climbing down the mountain, the righteous Rama reviewed in his mind the strength of his army and the enemy which is difficult to assail. Raghava, who is knowledgeable of when to do what, motivated the army of Vanaras and Sugriva and ordered. Surrounded by a large army in front, the broad shouldered Rama proceeded towards Lanka. Then Vibheeshana, Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan, Nala, Neela in the same way Lakshmana followed. Then the bears, monkeys, covering all over the land went behind Rama. The monkeys who were of the size of elephants capable of warding off the enemy, bore huge grown up trees in their hands and went. In a short while the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, tamers of foes reached the city of Lanka. Commanded by Rama's words the Vanaras remaining in their positions as ordained, entered the wonderful Lanka, which was decorated with flags, embellished with gardens. The defensive walls and arches of the boundary of Lanka were difficult to access even for Devatas. Commanded by Rama's words the Vanaras remaining in their positions as ordained, entered the wonderful Lanka, which was decorated with flags, embellished with gardens. The defensive walls and arches of the boundary of Lanka were difficult to access even for Devatas. Accompanied by his brother Lakshmana, Rama, armed with bow, blocked the northern gate of Lanka which was like a lofty mountain peak and protected. (Dasaratha's son) Rama who had Lakshmana as follower reached the northern gate protected by Ravana. Just as the ocean is guarded by Varuna, it was guarded by terrific Rakshasas, who were secretly hiding all over like the Rakshasas in the subterranean region with small amounts of numerous armours for protection. It was not possible for anyone other than Rama to enter. (Dasaratha's son) Rama who had Lakshmana as follower reached the northern gate protected by Ravana.

Just as the ocean is guarded by Varuna, it was guarded by terrific Rakshasas, who were secretly hiding all over like the Rakshasas in the subterranean region with small amounts of numerous armours for protection. It was not possible for anyone other than Rama to enter. Rama Saw there, numerous weapons of every kind so also shields for the combatants of war. Neela the commanderinchief of the army of monkeys, a valiant one, also Dwivida, and Mainda reached the east gate and remained there. Angada endowed with great prowess along with Rshaba, Gavaksha, Gaja, and Gavaya reached the south gate. Mighty monkey Hanuman united with heroes Pramati and Praghasa and others protected the west gate. Sugriva chief of all army and best of the monkey army who was equal to Garuda of beautiful wings, endowed with wind speed remained in the middle (of north and west) post. Renowned generals of the Vanara army and thirtysix crores of Vanaras stood there camping. By the command of Rama, Vibheeshana accompanied by Lakshmana posted crores and crores of Vanaras there. Sushena along with Jambavan and a large army of Vanaras were posted in the centre not far from Rama at the west by Rama's order. Vanaras who resembled tigers, endowed with sharp teeth joyfully stood there holding trees and peaks of mountain waiting to combat. All had their tails lifted unusually, had their nails and teeth sharp as weapons, some had unnatural face, and all of them had distorted eyes (as in fury). A few of them were having the strength of ten elephants, some had ten times more than others, and a few were endowed with great strength equal to thousand elephants. Few monkeys had strength of an ogha, some had a hundred times more, and the monkey commanders possessed immeasurable strength. There it seemed as if a flight of locusts had gathered, with monkey army gathered there. It was amazing and astonishing. Vanaras settled in such a way all around Lanka completely covering the land with those already at Lanka. A hundred thousand bars and monkeys and several others already gathered at the gates of Lanka to fight proceeded. All over the mountain the monkeys surrounded the boundary wall of Lanka city to collect information. Mighty Vanaras holding uprooted trees occupied everywhere and it seemed difficult for even wind to enter Lanka. Caught by Vanaras like clouds and equalled Indra in valour gave way to wonder for the Rakshasas. Thereafter with the divisions of the Vanara army moving like the ocean on the mountain peak, appeared like the roaring sound of water in the ocean moving out of boundary. By the great sound the boundary, the archways and the mountains and forests shook violently. Protected by Rama and Lakshmana and Sugriva that an army of monkeys became difficult to assail even for Rakshasas and Devatas. Deliberating on the action to be taken to kill the Rakshasas, Raghava himself called the army and gathered them and the ministers all of them again and again discussed and took the decision. Later recalling the king's duty with Vibheeshana, summoned Vali's son Angada and spoke these words.

Later recalling the king's duty with Vibheeshana, summoned Vali's son Angada and spoke these words. \"O noble Hanuman crossing over Lanka without fear, giving up the difficulties experienced earlier we reached. Admonish the tenheaded king who has lost senses, his past fortune and sovereignty.\" \"O night ranger! the time has come for punishment for the sins committed by you to the sages, Devatas, so also to Gandharvas, celestial beauties, Nagas, Yakshas and the kings because of your delusion in conceit. Surely your pride about the boons begotten from the selfborn creator will be gone, said Rama. \"O night ranger! the time has come for punishment for the sins committed by you to the sages, Devatas, so also to Gandharvas, celestial beauties, Nagas, Yakshas and the kings because of your delusion in conceit. Surely your pride about the boons begotten from the selfborn creator will be gone, said Rama. \"O night ranger! the time has come for punishment for the sins committed by you to the sages, Devatas, so also to Gandharvas, celestial beauties, Nagas, Yakshas and the kings because of your delusion in conceit. Surely your pride about the boons begotten from the selfborn creator will be gone, said Rama. \"You, who have abducted my wife, I will punish you with a rod of punishment. I am your chastiser, O king of Lanka I have taken position.\" \"O Rakshasa! Even Devatas, sages and even royal sages have also lost their lives, killed by me.\" \"O lowly Rakshasa! By deceiving me you took away Sita. Display that strength now.\" \"If you do not seek my protection I will devoid this world of Rakshasas with my sharp arrows.\" \"This Vibheeshana, the best of Rakshasas will be glorious and fortunate undoubtedly having got the kingdom of Lanka.\" \"One who is not aware of himself, an unrighteous sinner ruling with foolish mates cannot enjoy the kingdom even for a moment.\" \"O Rakshasa! You are resorting to fortitude and valour and embracing gallantry in war. By my arrows you will obtain peace (in death).\" \"O Ravana! You have no control over your mind, and if you come in the range of my eyesight and enter the three worlds also you will not go alive again.\" Having addressed it in well meaning words, Rama said 'I will do you obsequies as no one will be left in Lanka to do your last rites'. Rama having spoken that way, Tara's son, Angada, who was like fire god, who was unwearied in action flew to the sky. Angada landed on Ravana's palace in a moment and saw the tiger like prosperous Ravana seated with his ministers. Thereafter, the leader of the monkeys, Angada adorned with golden armlets stood like a blazing fire at a distance. \"I made known the words of Rama completely without adding or deleting. You may listen.\" \"I am the son of Vali,by name Angada,an envoy of Rama ,the king of Kosala of unwearied action. You may know that I have landed\" \"Raghava, the enhancer of the happiness of Kausalya speaks to you. Ruthless Rakshasa! Sallying forth, get ready for combat.\" \"You and your son's relatives and followers being killed (by me) the three worlds will be rid of fear of you.\" \"You are an enemy of the gods, Danavas and Yakshas, Gandharvas and Nagas and being a thorn in the neck of sages, I will uproot you from here.\" \"Unless you return back Vaidehi respectfully, bowing down to me you will be killed and Vibheeshana will get the fortune.\" The leader of the monkeys having spoken in that manner, Ravana the ruler of night rangers was overtaken by fury. Thereafter, Ravana who was shaken by fury repeatedly commanded his ministers and said 'Let this evil minded monkey be seized and killed'. Thereafter, having heard the words of Ravana, the four Rakshasas seized Angada blazing in brilliance like fire. Then Angada, the son of Tara, on his own wanting to exhibit his strength in the presence of the Rakshasa army allowed himself to be caught. Then Angada holding the Rakshasas by his arms came down like birds on the roof of the palace which stood like a mountain. Crushed by that speed of Angada coming down as if from the sky all the Rakshasas fell down on the ground while the Rakshasa king looked on. Then as the courageous Vali's son landed on the high peak of the palace which resembled a mountain peak, Ravana stood looking. As Ravana was looking, Angada trampling his feet gave way to the palace just as Himalayan peak broke to hit Indra. Hitting on the peak of the palace, Angada declaring his own name emitting loud sound rose up to the sky. Angada caused pain to the Rakshasas and delighted the monkeys and returned to the midst of Vanaras near Rama. Ravana exhibiting extreme anger at the shattering of his palace and seeing his destruction started sighing heavily. Delighted by the roaring sound of many monkeys Rama awaited surrounded by groups of monkeys desirous of starting war. Sushena of great prowess, who resembled a mountain in form stood there surrounded by many Vanaras who could change their form at their will. Sushena, a monkey who is difficult to encounter, went around all the four gates just like the moon goes around stars by the order of Sugriva. Seeing the large army of a hundred Akshauhinis of monkeys staying near Lanka spreading beyond the sea waiting for war the Rakshasas were wonder struck, some feared, some were alarmed to witness the jubilant Vanaras who exhibited joy alone. Seeing the large army of a hundred Akshauhinis of monkeys staying near Lanka spreading beyond the sea waiting for war the Rakshasas were wonder struck, some feared, some were alarmed to witness the jubilant Vanaras who exhibited joy alone. The Rakshasas were desperate to see the spread of monkeys over the entire area from the boundary to moat of Lanka. The way the space between was filled with Vanaras seemed as though the Vanaras converted into boundaries. Rakshasas were seen making a loud noise.",
                "Then the Rakshasas proceeding to Ravana's abode informed that Rama along with the vanaras have occupied the whole of Lanka. On knowing that Lanka is occupied, the night ranger Ravana, became very furious and doubled the forces of Lanka for the protection and went to the top of Lanka palace. He observed a countless number of Vanara troops spread all over Lanka, mountains, and forests. Seeing the Vanaras occupying the entire earth, Ravana thought of destroying and started thinking. Ravana, thinking over for long, picking up courage, saw Rama's Vanaras with thoughtful eyes. Raghava accompanied by the army happily went near and witnessed Lanka filled with Rakshasas all over. The son of Dasaratha saw Lanka decorated with flags and posts and thinking of Sita he became very worried. \"Here (Lanka) is the daughter of Janaka, immersed in sorrow because of me, tormented and emaciated without food and struggling.\" Thinking of Vaidehi again and again, who is pained, Rama ordered the Vanaras to kill the enemies immediately. Ordered in that way by Rama, who does not cause sorrow, the monkeys roared like lions getting ready for war on hearing Rama's words. The monkey troops thought of crushing Lanka with their fists and mountain peaks. Holding the mountain peaks, huge trees of many kinds, the Vanara leaders stood ready to fight. To make Rama happy, all the Vanara army divided into groups and started ascending the boundary (of Lanka) walls the king of Rakshasas was witnessing. Vanaras of copper colour faces and golden coloured ones, dedicating their lives for the sake of Rama holding Sala trees and rocks went towards Lanka. With the means of mountain peaks, as well as their fists, the Vanaras scaled the boundary walls and gateways of the city. The Vanaras started filling the moats with soil, pure water, logs of wood, grass, and mountain peaks. Then the Vanaras in thousands and crores ascended Lanka. The Vanaras started breaking the golden gateways and crushing them which were like peaks of Kailasa mountain. Jumping here and there like huge elephants, the Vanaras roaring like lions went into Lanka. \"Victorious is Sri Rama, who is exceedingly strong and Lakshmana who is endowed with supreme strength. Victorious is Sugriva the king of Vanaras who is protected by Raghava on all sides.\" Shouting in that manner, the monkeys who could change their form at their will started roaring and rushed towards the defensive walls. Veerabahu, Subahu, Nala and the foremost of the Vanara leaders storming the boundary walls in the meantime went inside and stationed at the northeast gate. Kumuda, surrounded by ten crores of mighty monkeys, who appeared like conquerors, stationed at the east gate. Praghasa the broad shouldered Vanara, was surrounded by Panasa for assisting him who encamped surrounded by many. Valiant Satabali with twenty crores of monkeys stood besieging the south gate. Sushena, father of Tara, (Vali's wife) the mighty, stood with sixty crores of monkeys at the western gate. Reaching the north gate, Sri Rama along with Saumithri, blockading the gate stood Sugriva the Lord of monkeys. Gavaksha of gigantic body and fierce appearance, along with one crore of Golangula species of monkeys endowed with extraordinary virility stood by the side of Sri Rama. Accompanied by a crore of Bears of redoubtable fury, Dhumra (brother of Jambavan), an exterminator of foes endowed with extraordinary valour stood by Rama's side. Vibheeshana with defensive clamour, of extraordinary virility accompanied by his mighty ministers, stood there with his mace in hand. Gaja, Gavaksha, Gava, Sarabha, Gandhamadana stood protecting the monkey troops wandering all over. Thereafter Ravana, the Lord of Rakshasas overcome by fury ordered all his forces to advance. Hearing the command issued from Ravana's mouth, immediately a terrific roar was raised by the night rangers. Then shone the white discs like the moon beaten by the Rakshasas with gold sticks making terrific sound. With hundred thousand Rakshasas blowing sonorous conchs, with the wind from their mouths, terrific noise arose. The night rangers with their brilliant dark limbs, with conchs, were like dark clouds provided with armour with flashes of lightning and accompanied by herons. Urged by Ravana, the army then joyfully rushed forth swiftly like a great ocean at the time of universal destruction. Thereafter the Vanara army emitted a sound that filled all sides of Malaya Mountain, its major and minor caves. By the blast of conchs and roll of drums, and roar of lions of Vanara and Rakshasa forces it resounded all over the earth, sky and up to the ocean. The trumpeting of the elephants, the neighing of horses, the clatter of the wheels of the chariots and the shout of Rakshasas resounded in the air. In the meantime, dreadful conflict arose all over between Rakshasas and Vanaras, which was like the conflict between Devas and asuras earlier. Vowing their own prowess, the Rakshasas began to strike the Vanaras with maces, flaming javelins, tridents, and pikes fiercely. \"May the vanara king,triumphant Sugriva be victorious\", thus sounded the cry of vanaras in the battlefield. Vanaras in the same manner attacked the Rakshasas, with trees and mountains, swiftly and with their nails and teeth. Standing on the walls, the redoubtable Rakshasas, pierced the Vanaras with swords, dreadful Bhindipalas. The vanaras jumping up dragged the Rakshasas stationed on the boundary wall down to the ground. The conflict that happened between the Rakshasas and Vanaras was amazing and intense and left a mire of flesh and blood.    This is the end of the forty second sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter the gigantic army of Vanaras were fighting with exceedingly terrific Rakshasas and the anguished Rakshasas could not tolerate the sight. Wishing victory for Ravana, the tiger among ogres, the Rakshasas of terrific deeds sallied forth accompanied by horses with golden trappings and seizing posts, which were like flames of fire shining like the sun's rays on the chariots and delightful shields, roaring resounding in all the ten directions. Wishing victory for Ravana, the tiger among ogres, the Rakshasas of terrific deeds sallied forth accompanied by horses with golden trappings and seizing posts, which were like flames of fire shining like the sun's rays on the chariots and delightful shields, roaring resounding in all the ten directions. Wishing triumph even the powerful army of powerful Vanaras of terrific deeds went ahead to fight with Rakshasas. At that time the Vanaras and Rakshasas facing each other started a dual fight. Indrajith, an exceedingly brilliant Rakshasa, contended with Angada, son of Vali just like Lord Siva with and haka, the Lord of death. Sampathi , who is invariably difficult to encounter in war fought with Prajangha, and Hanuman started with Jambumali. Highly furious Rakshasa, Vibheeshana, brother of Ravana fought with Rakshasa, Mitraghna. Gaja of great strength fought with Rakshasa Tapa, and highly energetic Neela fought with Nikumbha. Sugriva the Lord of Vanaras fought with Praghana and prosperous Lakshmana fought with Virupaksha. Agnikethu, a Rakshasa who is difficult to win over, Rasmikethu, Suptaghna and Yajnakepu waged war with Rama. Vajramushti with Mainda and Asaniprabhu with Dwivida, the chief of monkeys, fought with the two Rakshasas. Heroic and dreadful Pratapana, who is indomitable in the battle, fought with Nala endowed with high speed. Mighty Sushena, the righteous son fought with well known Vidyunmali. And fierce monkeys and Rakshasas fought in dual war with each other. Mighty Sushena, the righteous son fought with well known Vidyunmali. And fierce monkeys and Rakshasas fought in dual war with each other. Fierce war which made hair stand on end happened there, with the heroic Rakshasas and Vanaras longing for victory. In that war, the streams of blood that flowed from the bodies of Vanaras and Rakshasas were strewn like weeds in the form of hair, bearing logs of wood in the form of dead bodies. Enraged, Indrajith struck Angada with his mace, the destroyer of hostile forces which was like Indra who had done a hundred sacrifices, would strike with his thunderbolt. With the same mace (snatched from the Rakshasa) Angada swiftly struck Indrajit hand destroyed the horse, chariot, and charioteer. While Prajangha injured Sampathi with three arrows, in turn Sampathi killed him with Aswakarna tree in the midst of war. Jambumali of extraordinary might mounting on the chariot in the battle pierced Hanuman in his chest. Hanuman the son of wind god, getting on to the chariot quickly destroyed that Rakshasa Jambumali with his palm. Dreadful Pratapan roared and jumped over Nala. Nala in turn gouged out the eyes of Pratapan. Sugriva, the Vanara leader, taking hold of Sapataparni tree hit Pratapan who had his mouth open as if to swallow the army and killed him. Even Agnikethu who is difficult to attack, Rakshasas Rasmikethu, also Mitarghna and Yajakopa mangled Sri Rama with arrows. Raged Rama with his sharp arrows which were like flames of fire destroyed all the four Rakshasas by cutting their heads. Even Vajramushti fell on the ground struck with the fist by Mainda and the chariot and charioteer fell like the fort. Just as the Sun 's rays pierced through clouds Nikumbha was shattered and fell like a mass of collyrium in the battlefield. Nikumbha, the night ranger who was endowed with speed in shooting arrows again shot with a thousand arrows and laughed heartily. Like Lord Vishnu, Nila took the wheels of the chariot of Nikumbha and shattered the charioteer into pieces. Dwivida whose body was like a thunderbolt to feel, moved about on the mountain peak as Rakshasas were watching. Asaniprabha shot arrows resembling lightning at Dwivida the Vanara Lord who was fighting with trees. Dwivida whose limbs have been injured being enraged took Sala tree and killed Asaniprabha and the charioteer as well as the horses. Vidyunmali mounting the chariot started releasing arrows covered with gold at Sushena and roared. Nay, Sushena, the leader of Vanaras, saw himself down and Jambumali on top in the chariot. He crushed him with a big mountain peak. Vidyunmali seeing Sushena, the monkey leader got a huge rock, and hit him on his chest with the mace. Thereafter overtaken by anger, the monkey leader Sushena seized the huge rock from the Rakshasa and dropped it. Then Vidyunmali, seeing the leader of monkeys getting the huge rock, hit him on the chest with the mace. The great monkey leader Sushena, not caring for the mace, dropped the rock on Vidyunmali's chest. Vidyunmali, the Rakshasa hit by the huge rock, was ceased of life. In that manner the Rakshasa warriors and the Vanara warriors fought the duel wonderfully and like the way Devatas killed the Demons, the Rakshasas were killed. The battlefield was dreadful and, frequented by jackals with spears, javelins, maces, and swords, strewn all over, similarly with broken chariots, horses, elephants, and monkeys fit for war. Broken wheels and axles of chariots were found all over. The battlefield was dreadful and, frequented by jackals with spears, javelins, maces, and swords, strewn all over, similarly with broken chariots, horses, elephants, and monkeys fit for war. Broken wheels and axles of chariots were found all over. It was like the war between Devatas and demons, with the trunks of the bodies of Vanaras and Rakshasas rubbing together lying scattered in all directions. Then the Rakshasas killed by Vanara leaders, their bodies full of blood were looking for sunset and again picking up strength began to battle.    This is the end of the forty third sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus, as the Vanaras and Rakshasas were battling, the Sun began to set, which is not favourable to the life of Vanaras. Then Vanaras and dreadful Rakshasas being strongly inimical to each other started the night battle wishing victory. In the fierce darkness that prevailed, monkeys hit monkeys thinking to be Rakshasas and Rakshasas hit Rakshasas thinking to be Vanaras (not knowing in darkness) hit each other. \"Strike\", \"Tear\", \"Why are you running away?\" were the kind of tumultuous echo heard in the darkness of the night. In that darkness the dark complexioned Vanaras and Rakshasas covered with golden armour in the night seemed like shining herbs of the forest in the mountain. \"Strike\", \"Tear\", \"Why are you running away?\" were the kind of tumultuous echo heard in the darkness of the night. In that darkness the dark complexioned Vanaras and Rakshasas covered with golden armour in the night seemed like shining herbs of the forest in the mountain. In that pitch darkness, which was difficult even to move, the Rakshasas overcome by anger and lost senses were wandering devouring the monkeys. The mighty strong Vanaras, terribly angry at the Rakshasas sprang up to the sky, and tore with their sharp teeth, the horses of Rakshasas decked with golden ornaments pervading like fire in the battle. Having lost senses in fury they dragged the elephants, those mounted upon them, and the chariots decorated with posts and flags and tore them with their teeth. Then Rama as well as Lakshmana with their venomous snakelike arrows killed both visible and invisible principal Rakshasas. Then the dust rose from the ground pulverised the horses' hooves and crushed by the chariot wheels, filling the ears and eyes of those in war. In that way as the war was going on, and rivers of blood flowing with the terrific noise it made hair stand on end. There arose wonderful sounds of musical instruments, the sounds of kettle drums, wooden drums, mixed with conchs and flutes. There from the battlefield arose the roaring sounds of wounded and appeased Rakshasas and Vanaras. There with warriors of Vanaras wounded by javelins, tridents and axes, and the Rakshasas of mountain size who could change their form at will, the battlefield was muddy, and wet with blood flowing and difficult to reach. There with warriors of Vanaras wounded by javelins, tridents and axes, and the Rakshasas of mountain size who could change their form at will, the battlefield was muddy, and wet with blood flowing and difficult to reach. Like the dreadful night for all beings, difficult to spend, as if it were a dissolution, destructive to Vanaras and Rakshasas. Thereafter in that exceedingly fearsome dark night in the battlefield highly delighted Rakshasas assailed Rama with a rain of arrows. The thundering noise of the angry Rakshasas rushing towards Rama was like the seven seas rising to flow into the ocean. On Rama striking with the six best of shafts like flames in a time of twinkling of eyelids, the six Rakshasas, Yamasatru, Mahaparva, Mahodara, Mahakaya, and Vajradamshtra found it difficult to overcome. Along with the two Suka, Saranas all of them were struck by Rama's fire like arrows in their vital parts and escaped with leftover life.

Along with the two Suka, Saranas all of them were struck by Rama's fire like arrows in their vital parts and escaped with leftover life. Mighty Rama with his shafts that were like flames of fire, decorated with gold, brightened in all directions. Those fierce Rakshasas who stood in front of Rama were destroyed like fireflies fallen in fire. By the rain of thousands of golden feathered arrows, the night appeared as if illumined by fireflies and like a wonderful autumnal night. The night which was fierce appeared more dreadful with the loud noise of Rakshasas and Vanaras. Resounding with the sound rising all over the caves of Trikuta mountain echoed and it looked as if the mountain was responding to someone's call. The dark complexioned Rakshasas of gigantic body, who were highly energetic were held tightly by the monkeys with black faces and long tails and allowed them to be devoured. Angada who was determined to kill the enemies, in no time wounded Ravana's charioteer and also the horses. As the violent war was going on, the great cheat, Indrajith disappeared from there as Angada had already killed his horses and charioteer. As the violent war was going on, the great cheat, Indrajith disappeared from there as Angada had already killed his horses and charioteer. Angada who was worthy of worship, was praised by even the sages, all deities and both Rama and Lakshmana for his action. All beings present in war were aware of Indrajith's deeds. Therefore, they were gratified to see him defeated. Thereafter, Sugriva, Vibheeshana and all monkeys gratified with Angada's deed cried out saying \"Excellent, Well done\". Then Indrajith of terrible deeds defeated by Angada in the comb at became terribly angry. That sinful son of Ravana, who is capable of encountering rising up remained invisible and shot sharp arrows. The angry Rakshasa (remaining invisible) pierced arrows full of serpents all over the body of Rama and Lakshmana. The Rakshasa waging war in invisible form with all beings by his supernatural powers fought with both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana and bound them in a network of arrows. Then the Vanaras beheld the two brothers, tigers among men bound forcibly by the angry Rakshasas like venomous monkeys. Then the evil minded Rakshasa king's son, being incapable of getting bound in visible form, by remaining invisible, bound them deceitfully.    This is the end of the forty fourth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rama, the son of the king, a powerful and strong warrior, ordered ten Vanaras to know the whereabouts (of Indrajith). Rama, the scorcher of enemies, ordered the two sons of Sushena, the best of Vanaras Neela, Jambavantha, Angada, as well as courageous Sarabha, Vinatha, and Hanumantha and Sanuprastha endowed with extraordinary might, also Rshaba and Rshaba Skanda. Rama, the scorcher of enemies, ordered the two sons of Sushena, the best of Vanaras Neela, Jambavantha, Angada, as well as courageous Sarabha, Vinatha, and Hanumantha and Sanuprastha endowed with extraordinary might, also Rshaba and Rshaba Skanda. All those monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, held huge trees, and went in ten directions searching and sprang to the sky. Ravana's son being skilled in the use of weapons and an expert in mystic powers, he prohibited the speed of the Vanaras with his swift arrows. The Vanaras were mangled with iron arrows, however endowed with high speed they could not make out Indrajith in utter darkness just as the sun covered by clouds. Indrajith who is ever victorious, pierced repeatedly arrows all over the body of Rama and Lakshmana. Both Rama and Lakshmana were pierced by furious Indrajith with serpents like arrows furious. Both Rama and Lakshmana bleeding excessively, wounded profusely, looked bright and red like Kimsuka trees with flowers. Then Ravana's son with the corner of his eyes turned red in anger looking like a huge collyrium, vanished from there and spoke these words to the two brothers, Rama, and Lakshmana. Indrajith who had fire like eyes, said,\" even the ruler of gods cannot discern while I am fighting war, why speak about you? It is not possible.\" \"Raghava brothers! You are enmeshed with plumes of arrows all over the body. My anger will not go waste. I will send you to the abode of Yama, the Lord of death.\" Indrajith having spoken to the righteous brothers Rama and Lakshmana in that way, began to pain them with arrows and stood rejoiced roaring aloud. Indrajith who was like a mass of crushed black hill, mounting the huge bow released terrific arrows again and again in that great conflict. There after that warrior went on digging sharp arrows into the vital parts of Rama and Lakshmana again and again and kept roaring. In a fraction of a second, both Rama and Lakshmana facing the battle were bound by arrows and did not have energy to retaliate. Pierced all over their bodies with the heads of arrows, the gallant princes freed themselves from the cords by shaking violently like the banners of Indra. Pained by the hurting of the vital parts of both the princes, the Lords of the world fell. Pierced all over their bodies with the heads of arrows, the gallant princes freed themselves from the cords by shaking violently like the banners of Indra. Pained by the hurting of the vital parts of both the princes, the Lords of the world fell. The princes were lying on the warrior's bed in the battlefield, their limbs fully covered with arrows, in a highly distressed state. Not an inch of space on their bodies remained without being pierced. Not even a part of the body was left unshaken, unhurt, or wounded. Wounded by the cruel Rakshasas capable of changing form at their will, blood flowed from their body copiously like water from spring bringing out their vital life breaths. Rama fell first pierced by arrows in his vital parts released in anger by Indrajith, by whom Indra was utterly defeated. Indrajith pierced Rama with arrows coated with gold and gold tipped arrows, which had even and circular heads, with halfmoon arrows, with axe like heads, heads like joined palms, heads resembling teeth of calf and lion teeth arrows as well as razor sharp arrows which descended quickly unobstructed like dust. Rama lay relaxed on the hero's bed quitting his goldplated bow strung and bent at both ends, and the middle. Lakshmana remained beholding the best of men fallen at an arrow's throw disappointed at his life. Lakshmana grieved seeing his elder brother Rama pierced by arrows, pained, and fallen on the ground. Even the monkeys' eyes were filled with tears, very much stricken with grief seeing Rama fallen and shrieked. Hanuman's army of Vanaras collected together stood surrounding fallen princes lying on the ground, despondent and extremely sorrowful.    This is the end of the forty fifth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter looking at the sky and the ground for Rama and Lakshmana, the Vanara leaders saw the two brothers, lying on the ground hurt by arrows. Indrajith retired after completing the task, like a cloud that retires after raining. Then came Vibheeshana and Sugriva to that location. Neela, Dwivida, Mainda, Sushena, Kumuda, Angada accompanied by Hanuman grieved intensely on looking at the Raghavas. Unable to move, with feeble breath, drenched in blood and the body covered all over with arrows, lying on a bed of arrows, stunned, with reduced prowess, sighing like serpents, the heroes, Rama, and Lakshmana, who were like golden posts became dull. Rama and Lakshmana were lying on a heroic bed, arrows stuck to the bodies. Vibheeshana and all the Vanaras kept seeing both the scions and wept surrounding them.

Rama and Lakshmana were lying on a heroic bed, arrows stuck to the bodies. Vibheeshana and all the Vanaras kept seeing both the scions and wept surrounding them. Though the Vanaras searched all over the battlefield and in all directions of the sky, they could not see Indrajith of mystical powers. Vibheeshana started looking with occult powers for his brother's son endowed with occult power following occult means and found Indrajith. Brilliant and glorious Vibheeshana, capable of difficult deeds, incomparable at work, and in fight, unrivalled in battle, saw the hidden hero Indrajith by virtue of a boon (from Brahma). Reviewing the scions lying on bed by his action, Indrajith caused extreme joy to all Rakshasas and spoke. \"The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who slayed Dushana and Khara have been struck.\" \"Even if all the sages, Devatas and Rakshasas collected together come, they cannot get liberated from this bondage of arrows.\" \"On whose account my father was in grief and spent all night and passed the three parts of the night (without sleep) and why he was unable to sleep was not understood clearly. By his (Rama's) action this Lanka is agitated like a river during the rainy season. He, who is the root cause of this calamity, has been got rid of by me,\" thought Indrajith. \"On whose account my father was in grief and spent all night and passed the three parts of the night (without sleep) and why he was unable to sleep was not understood clearly. By his (Rama's) action this Lanka is agitated like a river during the rainy season. He, who is the root cause of this calamity, has been got rid of by me,\" thought Indrajith. \"Rama, and Lakshmana and even all valiant Vanaras have been got rid of just like clouds of autumn are wasted.\" Indrajith, having spoken in that way to all Rakshasas, began to strike all the Vanara leaders looking at him. The slayer of enemies, Indrajith attacked Neela with nine shafts, so also Mainda and Dwivida with three separate sharpedged shafts. Indrajith endowed with great bow pierced Jambavan in his chest, and released ten arrows at Hanuman, endowed with speed in war. Indrajith endowed with speed in war, attacked highly energetic Gavaksha and Sarabha with two arrows each. Thereafter Indrajith attacked the ruler of Golangulas, and Vali's son Angada with many arrows. Mighty son of Ravana, then attacked the best of monkeys with arrows which were like flames of fire. Indrajith hurt the Vanaras with hails of arrows terrifying them. Then the mighty armed son of Ravana laughed and spoke these words. \"O Rakshasas! Look at these two brothers together bound by my fierce arrows in front of you.\" Indrajith having spoken in that way to the Rakshasas, all of them were highly amazed by the action of Indrajith and went laughing. The Rakshasas thundering like rain clouds, roaring aloud thinking 'Rama is killed' by Ravana's son offered prayers. Thereafter having seen the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana not responding or breathing, lying on the ground, he thought they were dead. Indrajith, who is victorious in battles, feeling happy and creating happiness to all Rakshasas collected there entered the city of Lanka. Sugriva was overtaken by fear on seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddled with arrows from head to foot all over the body Sugriva was overtaken by fear on seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddled with arrows from head to foot all over the body Sugriva was overtaken by fear on seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddled with arrows from head to foot all over the body Sugriva was overtaken by fear on seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddled with arrows from head to foot all over the body \"O Vanara! We are helpless, be confident, for those following righteousness and truthfulness there is no fear of death.\" Vibheeshana, having spoken in that manner, there after dipped his hand in water and wiped the beautiful eyes of Sugriva to brighten. Thereafter the dutiful Vibheeshana taking water as per tradition consecrated chanting sacred text and wiped Sugriva's eyes. Wise Vibheeshana having wiped Sugriva's face clean in accordance with time addressed with opportune words. \"O king of monkeys! This is not the time for faint heartedness. Extreme attachment at this time will lead us to death.\" \"Therefore, give up faintheartedness as all actions will be destroyed by that. Following Rama's leadership, think of the army's welfare.\" \"Or else till they become conscious, protect the Kakuthsa princes. When they become conscious, they can get rid of our fear.\" \"Therefore, Rama has no fear of death, even a little. Whatever splendour is lost, prosperity will not leave him.\" \"Therefore, restoring breath let us reassure the army again till all actions are carried out by restoring their confidence.\" \"O Monkey leader! these monkeys whose eyes have become big (are dilated) with fear are talking ear to ear (about Rama).\" \"Let the army forces of monkeys be happy seeing me moving, getting rid of the inherent fear in them just as they discard a garland of flowers enjoyed by them earlier.\" The king of Rakshasas, Vibheeshana having assured Sugriva, knowing the Vanara army he reassured them. Great Indrajith surrounded by all army entered the city of Lanka and approached his father. Having reached Ravana, Indrajith greeted him with folded palms and broke the pleasant news, \"Rama and Lakshmana are killed.\" In the midst of Rakshasas, Ravana hearing the news of his enemies being killed, rejoiced, and got up from his couch and embraced his son. Delighted Ravana kissed his son on the forehead and enquired of him of the details. Indrajith presented details saying that both Rama and Lakshmana were stunned in the network of arrows, and lost splendour. Delighted Ravana kissed his son on the forehead and enquired of him of the details. Indrajith presented details saying that both Rama and Lakshmana were stunned in the network of arrows, and lost splendour. Hearing the words of the great chariot warrior, Ravana was filled with excessive joy at heart. His fear and agony of Dasaratha's son having gone on hearing the words of his son, Ravana greeted him.    This is the end of the forty sixth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After accomplishing the task Ravana's son entered Lanka while the bull among monkeys guarded Raghava staying around. Having arranged the army in place, Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Kumuda, Nala, Gava, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Sanuprastha, Jambavan, Rshaba, Rambha, Satavali, Pruthu, who are always alert were holding trees and looking above, on either side and in all directions and guarded Rama.

Whenever there was movement of even a blade of grass, they thought that it might be Rakshasa. Ravana was also content to send away his son Indrajith and calls for the Rakshasa woman, caretaker of Sita. The rakshasi and also Trijata came and waited there by the order. Lowly Rakshasa, Ravana, full of joy addressed rakshasi. \"Rama and Lakshmana are killed by Indrajith in war. Take Vaidehi in the aerial car and show her.\" \"That husband with whose support she was proud and not yielding to me is unconscious along with his brother who have been killed,\" said Ravana. \"Mythili, rid of sorrow and free from perturbation, giving up hope (of Rama) can wait upon me adorned with all kinds of jewels.\" Ravana thought that the broad eyed Sita coming to conclusion in course of time that Rama has gone along with Lakshmana, rid of hope, with no other haven, will seek him on her own accord. The evil minded Rakshasas listening to Ravana's words went to the aerial car. Thereafter, by Ravana's order the Rakshasas went with the aerial car to Mythili in the Ashoka Garden. Then the Rakshasas took the aerial car near Sita who was overcome by her husband's grief. Thereafter the Rakshasas along with Trijata went to Sita and made her ascend Pushpaka to see Rama and Lakshmana. The Lord of Rakshasas rejoiced and went to Lanka decorated with flags and posts proclaiming that Rama and Lakshmana were killed by Indrajith in war. The Lord of Rakshasas rejoiced and went to Lanka decorated with flags and posts proclaiming that Rama and Lakshmana were killed by Indrajith in war. Sita and Trijata flying on the Pushpaka saw all the fallen Vanara army. Sita beheld extremely happy Rakshasas, and grief stricken Vanaras, in great agony near Rama and Lakshmana. Thereafter Sita beheld both Rama and Lakshmana lying on the bed of arrows, unconscious, struck by arrows, with shields of darts, arrows with feathers, all limbs wounded with shattered armour, bows and reeds. Thereafter Sita beheld both Rama and Lakshmana lying on the bed of arrows, unconscious, struck by arrows, with shields of darts, arrows with feathers, all limbs wounded with shattered armour, bows and reeds.

                "On seeing her husband killed and also mighty Lakshmana, Sita became emotional in intense sorrow and cried piteously. \"Whoever was capable of predicting the future have said that I will be the mother of sons and not become a widow. Now if Rama is dead, they become liars.\" \"Whoever conducted sacrificial ceremonies and are knowledgeable of sastras have told me that I would be consort. They are all liars now as Rama is killed.\" \"The astrologers, brahmins who have promised me to be auspicious and all the wise who have spoken are liars if Rama is killed.\" \"Whoever has told me that I will be the wife of a man of great prowess, worshipped by husband, and all wise men are liars if Rama is killed.\" \"Those virtuous lotus marks that a woman has on their feet to become crowned queen of a kingdom are seen in my feet.\" \"Those inauspicious signs found in unlucky and widowed women are difficult to find in me. I do not see any such signs in me.\" \"Characteristic marks of lotuses, unfailing in their effect (truthful) predicted are all false if Rama is killed.\" \"My hair is fine and dark, my eyebrows are uniform and not joined, my shanks are round devoid of hair, and my teeth are closely set.\" \"My temporal bones, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, thighs are even, and my fingers are fleshy and round with nails proportioned and bright.\" \"My breasts are well formed and developed, the nipples are depressed and joined, the navel is deep, and the surrounding part is fleshy.\" \"My complexion is like the shine of a gem. My hair on the skin is soft. When I touch the ground with my ten fingers and toes, it is said to leave auspicious marks.\" \"My palms and feet placed together have no space which are auspicious marks and brahmins have said that my gentle smile is also a mark of auspiciousness.\" \"The prediction of astrologers that I will be consecrated with my husband and all that is falsified.\" \"Having gained Janasthana and crossing the ocean which is impossible knowing about my whereabouts and getting me is impossible since the brothers have been killed by the maya of Indrajith whose footprints are like a cow's hoof.\" \"Raghavas knew to use Varuna's weapons, fire god's weapons, Indra's also, even wind god's and Brahma's weapons. Why have they not used?\" \"Indrajith remaining invisible in war by conjuring could kill my husband who is equal to Indra in valour. Rama and Lakshmana! I am orphaned now.\" \"Even if the enemy is endowed with speed of thought, if he comes in the range of Rama's sight, he will not go alive.\" \"Rama along with Lakshmana has fallen in the battlefield. Time spirit is too heavy and capable of doing anything, so difficult to conquer.\" \"When I think of Rama or even great warrior Lakshmana, or my mother or myself I am not so sad as when I think of my motherinlaw who is an observer of austerity.\" \"She will also be worried and wait for Rama who has completed his vow (for fourteen years) and Lakshmana and Sita to come.\" Looking at Sita, worried, Trijata said 'Devi, do not despair. Your husband is alive'. \"O Devi! Rama and Lakshmana are alive. I see great reasons for this.\" \"If a husband ceases life in war, their face will not have an angry look or happy appearance.\" \"Vaidehi! Indeed, this aerial car called Pushpaka which is an auspicious one would not have brought you if they are ceased of life.\" \"The army chief killed, the interest of the troop lost, Pushpaka will move about without making an effort like the ship which lost the helmsman.\" \"O Lady, given to austerities! These monkeys are guarding Kakuthsa as proclaimed by me lovingly. Do not be confused. They are safe.\" \"This army is not doubting, not perturbed also, that they are killed. They are guarding the Kakutsthas lovingly. I am telling you.\" \"I have not uttered untruth earlier nor shall I do now. Indeed, you have found entry into my mind being a woman of good disposition.\" \"These two are not capable of being won in war even by gods or demons. On observation of the indications by me I am making you realize.\" \"O Mythili! Even though both of them have fallen and unconscious under arrows their body splendour has not diminished. You may see.\" \"Normally when we see men who have ceased life and stopped breathing their features are unappealing.\" \"O Janaka's daughter! You give up grief and delusion about Rama and Lakshmana. They are alive, no doubt.\" Sita who was like deity, on hearing the words of consolation, spoken by Trijata, greeted Trijata with palms together. Then Trijata took Sita in the Pushpaka chariot endowed with the speed of mind and entered Lanka. Thereafter Sita along with Trijata went to Pushpaka. Making Sita to get down, rakshasi also entered Ashoka grove. Having entered the Rakshasa's pleasure garden which had many trees, Sita gave way to intense sorrow having keenly observed the king's sons.

Sugriva, the very powerful one and all the best of Vanaras stood immersed in sorrow surrounding the great sons of Dasaratha, who were lying on the ground bound by a network of arrows like serpents, sighing, bodies covered with blood. In the meantime, Rama, although bound, being a man of fortitude established in spiritual discipline, returned to consciousness. There after seeing the piteous countenance of his brother, bound, and injured, Rama lamented. \"Of what purpose is my life when I behold my brother lying lifeless in war? What do I have with Sita? Or even with my life?\" \"In a mortal world I can look for a woman like Sita but not possible to find a helpful and capable brother.\" \"If Sumithra's dear son gets merged with the five elements, I will give up my life as the Vanaras are beholding.\" \"What can I say to mother Kausalya, Kaikeyi and mother Sumithra waiting to see her son?\" \"If I go to Ayodhya without him, how can I console Sumithra crying aloud like a female osprey?\" \"How can I return bereft of Lakshmana who went with me to the forest? What can I tell Satrughna, also the Bharata of great fame?\" \"If Sumithra asks me, I can't endure. I cannot bear it. I shall give up my body, my life here itself.\" \"What a pity! Me of sinful deeds and not a noble one, because of whose action Lakshmana's life having departed and lying on the bed of arrows.\" \"You were always comforting me when I was sad. Now however much I am grieved, ceased of life you cannot comfort me.\" \"You, who have struck down many Rakshasas in war, are lying unconscious on the same ground struck by arrows.\" \"Lying on the bed of arrows in the network of arrows, blood flowing out from the body he remains shining like the setting sun.\" \"Struck in the vital parts by the arrows, it is not possible for you to speak, but your anguish is indicated in your looks.\" \"This Lakshmana glowing in brightness, travelled with me following me in the forest. In the same way I shall follow him to the abode of death.\" \"He who was liked by relatives, was following ignoble me ever devoutly has reached this state.\" \"Indeed, heroic Lakshmana never uttered an unpalatable word. I do not remember him speaking harsh words even when he was deeply provoked.\" \"He who, in one go released five hundred arrows (with two hand s) is therefore superior to Kartaveerya (with thousand hands) releasing the same arrows.\" \"He, who could destroy Indra's arrows also deserves to be on Indra's bed, is lying on the ground, killed.\" \"I have not made Vibheeshana as the king of Rakshasas. Because of that untruth utterance they want to consume me, no doubt.\" \"Sugriva! You return back from here now. Strong Ravana will chase you because of my not being here.\" \"Sugriva! Return back from here along with the army keeping Angada in front, even Neela and Nala. Cross the ocean.\" \"O King of Bears! King of Golangulas! Difficult action has been done by you and others in war. I am pleased with Hanumantha's action.\" \"Formidable war was done by Angada, Mainda, Dwivida, and by all the Vanaras, Kesari and Sampathi.\" \"Gava, Gavaksha, Sarabha and others even Vanaras have done war sacrificing their lives for me.\" \"Sugriva! It is not possible for human beings to overcome God (destiny). O scorcher of enemies! Sugriva, my best friend, you have all done righteously that which is not possible.\" \"O Bulls among Vanaras! All of you should go permitted by me. You have done friend's work. You may go where you wish to go. I permit said Rama.\" All the Vanaras started shedding tears from their tawny eyes on listening to the lamentation of Rama. Thereafter, Vibheeshana, settling all the army, hastened to reach Raghava with a mace. Seeing Vibheeshana resembling a dark mountain, thinking him to be Indrajith, all the Vanaras ran from there.

                "Extremely brilliant and mighty Sugriva looking at the army of Vanaras said, \"Why are you worried like a boat tossed by wind in water?\" On hearing Sugriva's question, Angada the son of Vali said, \"Did you not see Dasaratha's sons Rama and chariot warrior Lakshmana, the great souls lying on a bed of arrows bathed in blood?\" On hearing Sugriva's question, Angada the son of Vali said, \"Did you not see Dasaratha's sons Rama and chariot warrior Lakshmana, the great souls lying on a bed of arrows bathed in blood?\" Then Vanara king Sugriva looking at Angada said, \"I do not think that the Vanaras running like this is not without any cause. Maybe out of fear of some reason ahead.\" \"Here, the distressed Vanaras with sad faces, their eyes downcast, are fleeing in all directions abandoning their arms.\" \"Without waiting to look back at others, not shy to see one another, the Vanaras are distancing themselves from those fallen and are seen fleeing.\" In the meantime, heroic Vibheeshana holding mace came to Sugriva and Rama and cheered with victory. Beholding Vibheeshana, the Vanaras fled, said Sugriva to the great Jambavan who stood near him. \"Vibheeshana has come here. Beholding him the foremost of the Vanaras fleeing suspecting him to be the son of Ravana.\" \"Call them back who are running in different directions quickly. Tell them Vibheeshana has come here.\" Sugriva having spoken in that way, the king of Bears, Jambavan restored the confidence of Vanaras. Having heard Jambavan, all the Vanaras finally shed their fear and returned to see Vibheeshana. On seeing the body of Rama and Lakshmana fully covered by arrows, Vibheeshana also became piteous and sad. Vibheeshana, wetting his hands with water cleaned the eyes of Rama and Lakshmana. Tormented with pain he cried aloud. \"Both the princess, who are endowed with good nature, and power are fond of combat. The Rakshasas have reduced them to this state by their deceitful ways.\" \"The princess who were guileless in their prowess were cheated by my evil minded and stupid son of my brother by his crooked thinking and cheating.\" \"Pierced with arrows, fully covered with blood, the bodies of the two princes appear like porcupines sleeping on the ground.\" \"These two bulls among men of great valour and fame whose refuge was sought by me are lying asleep wounded all over and limbs broken.\" \"Having lost my life ambition for the kingdom, frustrated I am. My enemy Ravana, having succeeded in his vow, did this deed.\" To Vibheeshana who was lamenting in that way, Sugriva, who was endowed with good qualities embraced him and spoke. \"O righteous one! there is no doubt that you will attain the kingdom of Lanka. Ravana and his sons will not attain what they desire.\" \"Both these heroes Raghava and Lakshmana wounded and pained having shaken off from their unconscious state will kill Ravana and his army in war.\" Thus, consoling and pacifying, the Rakshasa, Vibheeshana in that manner, Sugriva turned to his uncle Sushena and spoke. \"On regaining consciousness, take the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the tamers of enemies to Kishkinda accompanied by the heroic monkey army.\" \"On killing Ravana and his sons along with his kin, I will on my part also bring Mythili just as Indra recovered his prosperity.\" Hearing the words of Vanara Lord, Sushena spoke about the fierce and great war that he had experienced between Devas and asuras. \"Then the Rakshasas adept in using arms went about agitating concealing themselves, attacking Devatas who were learned in using arms.\" \"Brhaspati, the priest restored the wounded and lifeless, unconscious by means of reciting mantras, prayers and treatment by herbs.\" \"Let Sampati and Panasa go quickly to the milky ocean in a swift phase to get those medicines.\" \"Those monkeys only know the supreme medicine available in the mountains. They have to get Sanjeevakarani and Visalyakarani known to Brahma.\" \"There, where the milky ocean, the foremost of oceans, was churned, two mountains have risen by the name Chandra and Drona. The supreme herbs of medicine are present there.\" \"Both the mountains are well known. Deities have kept the herbal medicine there. Let the son of wind god, Hanuman proceed.\" In the mean while winds blew, clouds also rose up, water in the ocean was scattered about by the wind and lightning appeared in the sky. All the huge trees of the island were broken by the flutter of the wings (of Garuda) and fell into the salt water of the ocean. All the serpents and sea monsters inhabiting there terrified at Garuda went quickly into the salty waters of the ocean. Then all the Vanaras perceived Garuda endowed with mighty prowess, the son of Vinatha blazing like fire. Seeing the noble Rama and Lakshmana bound by the serpents in the form of arrows (released by Indrajith), the serpents fled. Thereafter Garuda paying his respects to the noble Rama and Lakshmana, touching their feet, wiped their face which shone like the moon. Caressed by Garuda, both their bodies were cleared of wounds instantly shone like gold and turned bright. Their brilliance, prowess, daring courage, intelligence, memory, and great qualities got manifested many folds. Raising up both the princes who were extraordinarily brilliant and equalled Indra, Garuda embraced Rama joyfully and thus spoke. \"By your kindness, we have overcome this calamity caused by Ravana's son and regained our strength as before.\" \"For me to meet you is like meeting my father Dasaratha and grandfather, Aja. My heart rejoices.\" \"Who are you, richly endowed with charming appearance, smeared with unguents adored in dust free garments, wearing beautiful ornaments?\" To Rama whose eyes were filled with joyful tears, Vinatha, the king of birds, full of brightness and strength said. \"O Kakuthsa! I am Garuthman, your dear friend and your outer breath. I reached here to help you.\" \"For the demons endowed with great strength and of mighty valour or for Gandharvas, or Vanaras or for even Devatas, or Indra who has done a hundred sacrifices, it is not possible to get relieved from bondage of the arrows of Indrajith of cruel deeds carried out by tricks.\" \"For the demons endowed with great strength and of mighty valour or for Gandharvas, or Vanaras or for even Devatas, or Indra who has done a hundred sacrifices, it is not possible to get relieved from bondage of the arrows of Indrajith of cruel deeds carried out by tricks.\" \"These arrows are serpents born of Kadra Devata. They have sharp fangs and are highly poisonous. By the tricks of Rakshasa, it has turned into arrows and reached you.\" \"You are lucky and also Lakshmana your brother, destroyer of foes in war. Rama your strength is truth, and you are righteous.\" \"Having heard the information about both of you bound by serpents, out of my friendship and affection and in obedience to you I hastened and reached here.\" \"Considering it as my duty to relieve you both from the frightful bondage of snakes I reached. Do not be inattentive and guileless.\" \"Rakshasas by nature use tricks in war. For noble people with good nature guilelessness is strength.\" \"Being so you should not trust Rakshasas. By this experience you know that Rakshasas are crooked.\" Having said so, Suparna endowed with mighty strength embraced Rama most affectionately and took leave of him. \"My dear friend! I wish to take leave of you. Truly you are knower of what is right, and you are dear even to an enemy.\" \"Heroic Rama! No question about your curiosity about our friendship now. After winning the war you will recognize.\" \"Lanka will be left with youngsters and the aged with your arrows. The enemy Ravana killed, you will recover Sita.\" Having spoken to Rama in that manner, Suparna endowed with wind speed in flight embraced Rama and went around him as a mark of reverence and soared into the sky. Having spoken to Rama in that manner, Suparna endowed with wind speed in flight embraced Rama and went around him as a mark of reverence and soared into the sky. Thereafter the Vanara troops, seeing the Raghavas freed from anguish, roared like a lion, and lashed their tails. Then the Vanaras played drums and even mridangams, blew conches and started jumping and leaping as before. The Vanaras who can fight with trees, uprooted several trees expressing their capacity distinctly and breaking them, and cracking their fingers. Making loud noise in hundreds and thousands stood there. Making a lot of noise, the Vanaras reached the gates of Lanka frightening night rangers and desiring to wage war. Thundering sounds resembling heavy clouds making terrific sounds arose, as if universal destruction was taking place at midnight.    This is the end of the fiftieth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Ravana and all the Rakshasas heard the increasing and highly tumultuous sound made by the courageous Vanaras. Thereafter, hearing the loud and deep sounds of roaring and seeing his (Ravana's) ministers in the midst, he spoke as follows. \"Many Vanaras have collected together and roared making loud noises just as thunder rumbling clouds. By that there is no doubt that they are very happy. For that reason, even the wide ocean is agitated.\" \"Many Vanaras have collected together and roared making loud noises just as thunder rumbling clouds. By that there is no doubt that they are very happy. For that reason, even the wide ocean is agitated.\" \"The two brothers Rama and Lakshmana are bound by sharp arrows. By the loud noise that I hear I doubt in my mind!\" Having spoken like that to the ministers, the Lord of Rakshasas said to the Rakshasas who stood waiting close by. \"For what reason are the Vanaras (rangers of woods) rejoicing that way in the time of grief? It may be found out speedily.\" Ravana having said so, the bewildered Rakshasas scaling the boundary wall beheld the army protected by great Sugriva and the prosperous Raghavas relieved from arrows and happy, he became worried. Ravana having said so, the bewildered Rakshasas scaling the boundary wall beheld the army protected by great Sugriva and the prosperous Raghavas relieved from arrows and happy, he became worried. All the dreadful Rakshasas getting down the boundary wall with pale faces, sad countenance reached the Lord of Rakshasas. Rakshasas who were well versed in talking, desperately conveyed the unpleasantness as it is to Ravana. \"The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are like powerful elephants have been set free from the bondage of arrows of Indrajith in the battlefield. Their shoulders are relieved and are like elephants snapped off the rope binding them.\" \"The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are like powerful elephants have been set free from the bondage of arrows of Indrajith in the battlefield. Their shoulders are relieved and are like elephants snapped off the rope binding them.\" The Rakshasa king endowed with mighty prowess became pale in face, worried and enraged on hearing the words of Rakshasas. \"My enemies who are bound by the formidable and unfailing, sharp, poisonous and bright arrows like the sun of Indrajith blessed with boons, are liberated from the bondage! I doubt if my army is in danger!\" \"My enemies who are bound by the formidable and unfailing, sharp, poisonous and bright arrows like the sun of Indrajith blessed with boons, are liberated from the bondage! I doubt if my army is in danger!\" \"My arrows which are equal in brilliance to Vasuki by which my enemies' life was taken away has become in fructuous now.\" Having said so, hissing Ravana called Dhumraksha to the midst. \"Dhumraksha of fierce prowess, you along with a huge Rakshasa army go just now to destroy Rama along with able Vanaras.\" Commanded by the Intelligent king of Rakshasas in that manner, Dhumraksha offered prayers and went from there joyfully. There after Dhumraksha went from the gateway and said to the CommanderinChief of the army\" Get ready immediately and start quickly. Why delay?\" On hearing the words of Dhumraksha, the CommanderinChief of the large army, he got ready quickly by the order of Ravana. Mighty army bound with girdles of bells to their waist, of fierce form roaring surrounded Dhumraksha joyfully. The dreadful Rakshasas set out roaring like rain clouds armed with different kinds of weapons, like tridents, darts, maces, spears, iron bars, rods, even clubs, spears and slings, arrows in thousands. The dreadful Rakshasas set out roaring like rain clouds armed with different kinds of weapons, like tridents, darts, maces, spears, iron bars, rods, even clubs, spears and slings, arrows in thousands.

And others collected together holding shields, fearless like tigers, frightful in appearance, mounted on fast horses, chariots yoked to donkeys of different kinds covered with gold mesh, on maddened elephants Set out. Dhumraksha of frightful tone mounted on a chariot adorned with gold yoked to donkeys with lion and bear like faces. Heroic Rakshasa, Dhumraksha surrounded by rakshasas set forth laughing to the west gate where Hanuman stood. While the Rakshasa was mounted on the chariot and going braying like a donkey, a fearful bird going in the sky stood before his chariot. A foul smelling frightening vulture (that feeds on the dead body) descended on top of the chariot and fell down. A trunk of a white bird drenched in blood sounding discordant fell near by Dhumraksha. It appeared like a rain god shedding blood on the ground. A trunk of a white bird drenched in blood sounding discordant fell near by Dhumraksha. It appeared like a rain god shedding blood on the ground. Thunder like roar was heard. Wind blew adversely. Darkness pervaded, and directions could not be seen. Then Rakshasa feared seeing the dreadful manifestation and got worried. All the Rakshasas walking in front of Dhumraksha lost consciousness. Thereafter many strong and powerful Rakshasas surrounding Dhumraksha, who was enthusiastic about war, beheld many Vanaras protected by Raghava like at universal dissolution.    This is the end of the fifty first sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Seeing Dhumraksha of terrible prowess returning, the vanaras made loud noises out of joy and desire to wage war. Tumultuous war took place between Vanaras and Rakshasas, striking one another, monkeys with terrible trees and Rakshasas with tridents and clubs. Fierce Rakshasas mowed down the Vanaras all over and even the Vanaras pulled down Rakshasas to the ground with trees. Highly enraged Rakshasas on their part fixed the Vanaras with sharp dreadful arrows with itching feathers. The Vanaras although strong were wielding maces, spikes, tridents, terrific iron bars and multitude of weapons of many kinds to crush the Rakshasas. They were endowed with prowess, knowledgeable of weapons and doing their duty without fear and with great enthusiasm. The Vanaras although strong were wielding maces, spikes, tridents, terrific iron bars and multitude of weapons of many kinds to crush the Rakshasas. They were endowed with prowess, knowledgeable of weapons and doing their duty without fear and with great enthusiasm. Vanaras 's bodies split in their necks by the terrible tridents, took up trees and rocks to fight. The monkeys endowed with terrific speed, proceeding from there roaring, proclaiming their names crushed the Rakshasa heroes. Wonderful fight took place between Vanaras and Rakshasas who held trees and rocks of several kinds. Vanaras who had conquered fear crushed Rakshasas into lumps of flesh indeed the Rakshasas threw out blood from their mouths. Some tore by the sides of the body, some crushed by the trees, some powdered by the rocks, and some were torn into pieces with teeth. Indeed, the night rangers were killed, their flags were broken. They were crushed, their swords were destroyed with chariots fallen. By the Vanaras hurling from the mountains, the crushed elephants were like mountains and the horses with riders crushed covered the ground all over. The Vanaras with their terrific valour jumping up wounded the Rakshasas in their face with their sharp nails. Some others with pale faces and dishevelled hair lost senses due to rolling in blood dropped on the ground. Other Rakshasas of terrific valour, extremely enraged, hit the monkeys with their palms which were hard as diamond to touch. Endowed with speed, the Vanaras also fell on the Rakshasas at greater speed, knocking them down with fists, feet, teeth and even trees. Dhumraksha, the bull among the Rakshasas seeing the army distressed and running away, being eager to fight began to cause havoc to the Vanaras. Few Vanaras mutilated by barbed darts, some struck with mallets, blood oozing dropped down. Some were pound by iron bars, some were torn up, some split and some pierced and cut ceased in life. In the battlefield some Vanaras, attacked by Rakshasas, were floating on the ground in blood, dead. Some with their hearts open and broken, beaten on side laid detached of their inner parts. The monkeys and Rakshasa groups took part in a fierce fight with rocks and trees abounding loud noise. It seemed like music in the form of twang of bow strings, neighing of horses like the sound of wooden cymbals, vocal music in the form of trumpeting of elephants, that battle seemed like symphony. Dhumraksha with his bow in hand, showering arrows, laughing in battlefront dispersed the Vanaras in directions. Beholding the perturbed army, Hanuman seized a huge rock and turned towards Dhumraksha. Endowed with mighty valour equal to his father, an angry Hanuman hurled the rock at the chariot of Dhumraksha. Beholding the rock descending upon him, Dhumraksha rushed instantly on the ground from the chariot and stood. That rock fell on the chariot and got crushed along with its wheel and axle and with arrows. Hanuman the son of WindGod in that way started destroying the chariot and the Rakshasa with tree trunks and stems. Some Rakshasas hit by trees with their heads broken, shedding blood fell on the ground. Hanuman the son of WindGod, after chasing the army of Rakshasas reaching the top of the mountain, jumped on Dhumraksha. Lifting his mace on seeing Hanuman, heroic and brave Dhumraksha darted on Hanuman, roaring like a lion. And then lifting his mace fixed with many nails, Dhumraksha enraged lighted on Hanuman. That fierce mace fell on Hanuman's head. Hanuman who was equal to wind god without caring for the hit dropped the peak of the mountain on the centre of Dhumraksha's head. By the falling of the peak of the mountain on Dhumraksha, all his limbs broken to pieces and crushed fell on the ground like a mountain. Those Rakshasas who survived the onslaught, seeing Dhumraksha killed, reentered Lanka out of fear of being killed by Vanaras. The son of wind god, the great soul, having killed the enemy in the battlefield and making the river of blood to flow, was exhausted by killing enemies. The monkeys started worshipping him in joy.    This is the end of the fifty second sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The Lord of Rakshasas was overcome with anger on hearing about Dhumraksha's death. He was hissing like a serpent, heaving a deep burning sigh, for having done a dirty task. He spoke to cruel Vajradamshtra of mighty prowess. The Lord of Rakshasas was overcome with anger on hearing about Dhumraksha's death. He was hissing like a serpent, heaving a deep burning sigh, for having done a dirty task. He spoke to cruel Vajradamshtra of mighty prowess. \"O Hero, proceed, accompanied by Rakshasa companions and kill Dasaratha's Rama and Sugriva along with Vanaras.\" The king of Rakshasas, being a deceit, having spoken in that way, many generals of the army went accompanied by elephants, horses, camels, and donkeys with chariots decorated with banners and pennons, and diadems collected together. The king of Rakshasas, being a deceit, having spoken in that way, many generals of the army went accompanied by elephants, horses, camels, and donkeys with chariots decorated with banners and pennons, and diadems collected together. Thereafter adorned with wonderful crowns studded with keyura gems, wearing a co at covering the body with bow in hand went alert. The general went ascending the chariot shining with well polished shining gold, decked with flags after going around clockwise. Armed with swords, many foot soldiers carrying poles, strange clubs, tridents, iron bars, slings and roped to throw spears and spears with sharp edges, swords, battle axes, javelins, and maces, departed. Armed with swords, many foot soldiers carrying poles, strange clubs, tridents, iron bars, slings and roped to throw spears and spears with sharp edges, swords, battle axes, javelins, and maces, departed. All the Rakshasa leaders decorated with lovely raiment, glowing, the heroes moved like mountains. They seemed like elephants intoxicated with ichor. Carrying tridents, clubs, and goads eager for war the Rakshasas mounted on mahouts and horses of noble characteristics, warriors with extraordinary might departed. Then the entire Rakshasa army determined with a purpose roaring like clouds of the rainy season it looked splendid and crossed over the southern gate where Angada was stationed. As they were leaving evil portents appeared. Dreadful jackals, dazzling fire from the sky and meteors falling appeared. As they were leaving evil portents appeared. Dreadful jackals, dazzling fire from the sky and meteors falling appeared. Then the fierce animals indicated the death of Rakshasas, who were going deluded with war and fell down. Mighty Vajradamshtra who was energetic, picking up courage seeing the portents that came up, sallied forth eager for war. Vanaras who assumed victory, seeing the Rakshasas coming out stretching filled all the ten directions with loud noise. Then dreadful encounters of fierce form took place between Vanaras and Rakshasas each one trying to kill another. Proceeding Further, very eager to fight they fell on the ground with their bodies broken, heads severed, and all limbs bathed in blood. Heroes in war whose hand s were like iron clubs, who never turned back in war, indeed flung weapons of many kinds on one another. There, a very loud fearful noise was heard which pierced the hearts in the battlefield, that was produced by the striking of weapons with trees and rocks. Then came out tumultuous sounds of clutter of chariots, bows, conches, kettle drums and tom toms. Indeed, abandoning the weapons, the Vanaras fought with their palms, fists, feet, trees, and knees and smashed the Rakshasas crushing their bodies like rocks. Indeed, abandoning the weapons, the Vanaras fought with their palms, fists, feet, trees, and knees and smashed the Rakshasas crushing their bodies like rocks. Vajradamshtra went about in the battle striking Vanaras just like death goes with a noose for destruction of the world. Mighty Vajradamshtra, who was endowed with the skill of using every kind of weapon, deluded with anger, went after the Vanara army. Seeing the Vanaras being destroyed, Vali's son, Angada with redoubled anger, like fire at the time of universal destruction, started to exterminate Rakshasas. Heroic Angada, equal to Indra in prowess, enraged, eyes turned red in anger, seizing a tree made a fierce fight with Rakshasa army like a lion with small animals.

There, struck by Angada of fearful valour, the Rakshasas fell like trees smashed and heads broken. Then the wonderful chariots, flags, horses, Vanaras and Rakshasas bodies bathed in blood fell on the ground looked fearful. The battlefield with strewn armlets, necklaces and clothes, weapons looked like autumnal night decorated all over.",
                "Vajradamshtra, the mighty Rakshasa became enraged with the destruction of his army and victory of Angada. Stretching his terrific bow which had the splendour of Indra's bow he (Vajradamshtra) showered shafts at the army troops of Vanaras and assailed them. Seated firmly on the chariots the chiefs and heroes of Rakshasas also fought steadily with different weapons in the combat. The best of Vanara warriors also gathered together with rocks in hand contended. Then in that battle the Rakshasas went on hurling thousands of missiles at the chiefs of Vanaras. Heroic Vanaras who resembled elephants in rut showered mountains and trees and huge rocks at Rakshasas. Between the heroes fighting the battle, who never returned, Great War continued between Rakshasas troops and Vanaras. There lay strewn some monkeys and Rakshasas also with severed heads, broken feet, with many weapons mangled with bodies, bathed in blood, arms and feet looped to necks devolving as prey to buzzards, vultures and crows surrounded. There lay strewn some monkeys and Rakshasas also with severed heads, broken feet, with many weapons mangled with bodies, bathed in blood, arms and feet looped to necks devolving as prey to buzzards, vultures and crows surrounded. Then in the battlefield, the timid vanaras and even rakshasas with their arms and heads cut off, bodies wounded allover dropped down. Thereafter Rakshasas were killed by Vanaras as Vajradamshtra kept looking at them and the Rakshasas ran from there. Struck by monkeys the Rakshasas were in fear. Seeing the Rakshasas Vajraddamshtra's eyes turned red in anger with bow in hand penetrating the Vanara troops terrifying them. Struck by monkeys the Rakshasas were in fear. Seeing the Rakshasas Vajraddamshtra's eyes turned red in anger with bow in hand penetrating the Vanara troops terrifying them. Valiant Vajradamshtra became very furious and pierced with arrows of plumes of buzzard which never missed target in seven, eight, nine and five Vanaras at a time. Struck with fear the Vanaras sought the protection of Angada just as people seek protection of Brahma, the creator of beings. Then the son of Vali gazing at the broken monkeys looking at Vajradamshtra in anger, faced himself. Vajradamshtra and Angada both enraged and strode among Rakshasas and monkeys and fought like a lion and intoxicated elephant. Then Angada endowed with great strength, pierced Vajradamshtra in his private parts with clubs used for piercing elephants. Angada who was endowed with great strength all his limbs bathed in blood and terrific valour took hold of a huge tree and shattered Vajradamshtra. That Rakshasa (Vajradamshtra) seeing the tree coming towards him was not bewildered. He shattered it into pieces, and it fell on the ground. The bull among monkeys, Angada seeing the valour of Vajradamshtra seizing a huge hillock hurled at the Rakshasa making loud sounds and breaking. The valiant Rakshasa who was not perplexed with mace in hand leaping down the chariot looking (at the hillock hurled) sat on the ground. The hillock discharged by Angada went right in the forefront of the battle and shattered the chariot along with its wheels and pole. Then Angada seized a huge hillock adorned with trees hurled at Vajradamshtra. Vajradamshtra vomiting blood became unconscious and clasping his mace breathing heavily he remained senseless for a while. The night ranger regained his senses, extremely angry, stood firmly and attacked Angada, son of Vali on his chest with his mace. Then leaving off the mace, a dual fight started there between one another, the monkeys, and Rakshasas. Exhausted by strain both very valiant fought like planets Angaraka and Budha and spit out blood. Then highly energetic, bull among Vanaras, Angada, uprooting a tree full of many flowers and fruits stood there. (The Rakshasa seized) a huge bright sword, a shield decorated with tiny bells and sword encased in hide sheath. Then desiring victory both monkey and Rakshasa struck one another passionately in wonderful harsh ways. Their wounds streaming blood, exhausted in the battlefield, when they rested on their knees on the ground, they were like charming Kimsuka blossoms. Angada, the elephant among the monkeys rose up in the mere twinkling of eyes, like a serpent struck by staff glowing in his eyes. Mighty son of Vali lopped off the great head of Vajradamshtra's with a sharpened stainless sword. His (Vajradamshtra's) limbs bathed in blood, cut off by sword, eyeballs rolling cleft into two dropped down. Deluded with fear, the Rakshasas seeing Vajradamshtra killed by monkeys, panic stricken, heads bent in shame, faces woebegone fled to Lanka. Deluded with fear, the Rakshasas seeing Vajradamshtra killed by monkeys, panic stricken, heads bent in shame, faces woebegone fled to Lanka. Mighty son of Vali, having killed Vajradamshtra, honoured in the midst of great Vanara army was joyful surrounded like the thousand eyed Indra, the Lord of gods.  This is the end of the fifty fourth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing about Vajradamshtra being killed by Vali's son, Ravana spoke to the chief of the army who stood with folded hands. \"Send for Akampana quickly, who is of terrific valour, difficult to encounter and skilled in all sastras.\" Akampana is a tamer of foes, protector of people, in that way capable, always desirous of welfare, lover of war. \"Scorcher of enemies, this Akampana will win Sugriva of terrific might, Rama and Lakshmana, dreadful Vanaras, and put an end to enemies.\" Then accepting Ravana's order, accordingly, taking hold of the army dispatched them. Thereafter taking different weapons, Rakshasas of fearful eyes and terrific appearance rushed forward ordered by CommanderinChief of the army. Mounted on a huge chariot, Akampana, decked in pure gold jewels, like cloud in form and complexion, whose loud voice resembled thunder, surrounded by Rakshasas went forward. Akampana who, possibly could not be shaken in war by suras shone like the sun in that manner. As Akampana was going forth excited to wage war, an expression of desperation developed suddenly in the horses drawing the chariots and an experience of depression in him. Himself being a lover of war, became pale with his countenance changed, voice choked, and his eyes lost its lustre. At a time on a good day of fine weather, it became cloudy, birds and beasts were making frightening cries all over. He whose shoulders were developed like that of a lion, who equalled tiger in valour, went forth not minding the evil portents. While that Akampana was going like that along with Rakshasas huge noise that arose was as if the ocean was agitated. Huge troops of Vanaras holding trees and hillocks stood prepared for waging and by that the noise that arose expanded. Vanaras and Rakshasas dedicated their lives for Rama and Ravana, respectively in that way were enraged and battle took place. Intending to kill one another both Vanaras and Rakshasas who resembled hills, also of extraordinary might and heroic fighting. A tremendous sound thundered in that war when they fought with exceeding impetuosity with one another and yelled at each other. Terrific dust of red colour arose instantly in all the ten directions by the Vanaras, and Rakshasas and it enveloped all over. The combatants could not see one another in the battlefield, and it seemed as though white silk piece was shaken by the wind by the appearance of the surrounding dust. By the dust raised, the posts, flags, shields and not even horses, weapons and chariots were visible. As they were rushing over one another, terrific noise was heard, and no form was discernible. Then in that darkness and in anger Vanaras went attacking Vanaras and Rakshasas also attacked Rakshasas (not knowing). Not knowing enemies and own people the Vanaras and Rakshasas terminating drenched the mud with their blood and covered the earth. Then moistened with blood, the dust settled on the ground was seen covered with bodies and limbs. Then Rakshasas and Vanaras fought one another vigorously with trees, javelins, maces, darts, rocks, and peaks. The Vanaras of terrific deeds, like hills in form, resembling iron bars attacked many Rakshasas in the battle. There, the highly furious Rakshasas also exterminated the Vanaras with their weapons and darts. Highly enraged Akampana of fierce valour cheered all the Rakshasa troops. Even the Vanaras mangled Rakshasas countering with weapons, huge rocks and trees and destroyed them. In the meantime, in the midst Kumuda, Nala, Mainda, heroic vanaras became furious and went Great heroes of the Vanara leaders, chiefs of army sportively waged a great battle and crushed Rakshasas repeatedly.    This is the end of the fifty fifth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Observing the great action and accomplishment of the foremost Vanaras in the battle, Akampana exhibited violent anger. Looking at the deeds of enemies, deluded with violent anger, Akampana spoke these words holding the bow and looking at the charioteer. \"O Charioteer, quickly drive the chariot to that place where many Rakshasas are destroyed in the battle.\" \"Those Vanaras are mighty and terribly angry. They are using trees and hillocks as weapons. Take me where chiefs are standing.\" \"I wish to see the end of Vanaras who boast of their warfare. The entire Rakshasa army is destroyed by them.\" Then Akampana seated in the chariot drawn by fast moving horses, assailed the Vanaras with a network of arrows. The Vanaras could not counter or stand nor fight in battle. What to say more? Shattered by Akampana's arrows, they all took to their heels. Having observed that Vanaras are fallen under the sway of Akampana and under the sway of death, mighty Hanuman approached Akampana. Seeing the great monkey, the Vanara troops got together and surrounded him. Seeing Hanuman, the monkey leaders took their shelter under him, got established firmly and became strong. On Akampana, who was well established like a mountain, mighty Hanuman showered torrents of arrows like Indra showered rain. Mighty Hanuman unmindful of the volley of arrows pierced in his body thought in his mind only about the destruction of Akampana. Hanuman, the highly energetic son of Maruthi laughing, sprung up causing the earth to shake and rushed to that Rakshasa. As he roared, his brilliance was blazing, his form was burning and became formidable for others to be at him. Vanara leader himself knowing that he is without any weapon, full of anger took up a mountain quickly. He, the heroic Maruthi, with one hand alone taking a huge mountain whirled round making loud noises. Then he went to Akampana and tormented him just as Indra did with his thunderbolt to Namuchi. Seeing the peak of the mountain uplifted, Akampana also discharged halfmoon shaped great arrows from a distance. Hanuman seeing the peak of the mountain broken into pieces by Rakshasa's arrows and fallen was deluded with anger. He (Hanuman) filled with pride and anger quickly uprooted an Aswakarana tree as huge as a mountain and held it. He (Hanuman) endowed with great splendour, seizing a huge trunk of Aswakarana tree with great delight, whirled it round on the ground laughing. Highly enraged Hanuman was running at high speed that his feet were seen breaking the trees and cleaving the earth. Hanuman struck the mahouts, elephants, similarly the chariots and riders of chariots as well as the terrific Rakshasas who fought standing on feet. Hanuman, enraged like the spirit of death, took their life (Rakshasas) armed with trees and on seeing him the Rakshasas took to their heels. The heroic Akampana saw Hanuman coming towards him very angry. Fearing Hanuman, the Rakshasas ran roaring in fear. With fourteen pointed powerful arrows, Akampana tormented and split the body of Hanuman. Valiant Hanuman, even though interrupted several times with rain of arrows, stood still like a mountain full of trees. The gigantic Hanuman, exceedingly valiant and courageous one shone like a fully blossomed Ashoka tree, resembled smokeless fire. Then Hanuman performed another supreme deed by uprooting a tree and striking on the head of Akampana, the chief of Rakshasas. Reacting in anger the great Vanara chief struck the Rakshasa with a tree, by which the Rakshasa fell down dead. Seeing Akampana lying dead on the ground, the Rakshasas were shaken like the trees in the earthquake and were distressed. Abandoning weapons, all Rakshasas having been defeated, chased by the Vanaras, frightened, ran away into Lanka. Perplexed, broken hearted, defeated, hair loosened the Rakshasas sweating all over their limbs, sighing heavily ran away very fast. Again, and again looking back in fear, covertly, bewildered, crushing one another, they went into the Lanka city. Those Rakshasas, endowed with prowess, on entering Lanka got together and paid respects to Hanuman. Hanuman also who was richly endowed with goodness greatly honoured all the Vanaras accordingly. In an atmosphere of triumph, the monkeys sportively shouted again saying that they are willing to give up their life also. Great Vanara, Maruti shone like a triumphant hero and saviour in front of the army, just as Lord Vishnu, the Lord of Devatas shone after killing the foes (demons). Thereafter Rama with the army of Devatas, Atibala and Lakshmana, in the same way Sugriva, the army chief, so also, Vibheeshana of exceeding might praised Hanuman.    This is the end of the fifty sixth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The king of Rakshasas hearing about the death of Akampana, was pale and a little angry and looked at his ministers. Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, reflected for a while and deliberated with his ministers and proceeded in the forenoon to inspect all posts in Lanka. Ravana saw Lanka guarded by the Rakshasa army, surrounded by many posts, with flags, posts, and pennants. Ravana, the Lord of Rakshasas seeing the city besieged, spoke to Prahastha who was skilled in warfare for his welfare. \"I am not able to see anyone (other than you) knowledgeable in warfare to deliver the city oppressed suddenly and can liberate from war.\" \"Either myself or Kumbhakarna, or my CommanderinChief, or you, or Indrajith, or Nikumbha can undertake such a burden.\" \"Therefore, quickly get ready with the army and take charge for conquering the vanaras collected there.\" As soon as you go there surely the unsettled Vanara army will run away hearing the uproar and loud noise of Rakshasas. \"Vanaras, who are fickle minded, undisciplined and volatile, will not endure the roar of lions of glowing Rakshasas.\" \"Prahastha! Knowing your strength, the helpless Vanaras will surely run away and along with Saumithri. Rama will fall into your power.\" \"If uncertain death comes it is good, not when it comes by not encountering. Think what is acceptable to you and what is not acceptable to you and that is acceptable to me.\" Prahastha, the CommanderinChief having heard Ravana, replied to the king of Rakshasas just as the preceptor of Rakshasas spoke to Bali. \"O king! This was deliberated with capable ministers earlier, is it not It was reviewed with one another, and controversy arose.\" \"If Sita is given away it is beneficial and if not given war is foreseen is known to us.\" \"You have always given me gifts, many honours and praises earlier and worshipped me. When time comes why will I not do\" \"I do not need to protect my life, sons, wives and wealth also. I am willing to give up my life also in war for you. You will see.\" Prahastha, having submitted to his king Ravana in that way, the CommanderinChief of the army commanded the army that stood before him. \"Get the great Rakshasa army together with me to the battlefield speedily. By my arrows all the carnivorous birds will be killed and satisfied with the flesh (of Vanaras) today\", said Prahastha. \"Get the great Rakshasa army together with me to the battlefield speedily. By my arrows all the carnivorous birds will be killed and satisfied with the flesh (of Vanaras) today\", said Prahastha. As soon as the commander in chief ordered in that way, the Rakshasa troops mobilized in the abode of Rakshasas. In a short while the whole of Lanka was filled with elephant size Rakshasa warriors gathered with different kinds of weapons. A fragrant breeze blew past there with Rakshasas propitiating fire god, with offerings and by the worshipping of brahmins the air was pleasant filled with the fragrance of ghee and flowers. Then the Rakshasas rejoiced, wishing victory, consecrated military material with chanting and wore flower garland s. Wearing bows and shields, looking at and greeting the king Ravana, they swiftly surrounded Prahastha. Taking leave of the king and causing terrific sound of blowing of drums, Prahastha, ascended, laughing on to a splendorous chariot, equipped to fight, driven by horses endowed with good speed and capable charioteer, sounding like a thundering cloud, shining like the sun and moon, with a sign of serpent on flag, provided with a wooden fence for defence, which was difficult to collide, covered with gold net.

Taking leave of the king and causing terrific sound of blowing of drums, Prahastha, ascended, laughing on to a splendorous chariot, equipped to fight, driven by horses endowed with good speed and capable charioteer, sounding like a thundering cloud, shining like the sun and moon, with a sign of serpent on flag, provided with a wooden fence for defence, which was difficult to collide, covered with gold net. Then, by the order of Ravana, Prahastha set out immediately and departed from Lanka taking a se at in the chariot, surrounded by the great army. As the CommanderinChief was going there arose sounds of kettle drums, blasts of fanfares, and noise of blasts of conchs filling the earth was heard. Rakshasas of fierce appearance, of huge body size, making dreadful sounds went marching ahead of Prahastha. Naranthaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada, Samunnatha, the adjutants of Prahastha went with him. He, emerged from the eastern gate, surrounded by a huge, formidable army formed into a battlearray, which resembled a herd of elephants. Prahastha emerged in rage surrounded by his forces which was like an ocean that resembled Kala (time spirit), Anthaka (death) and Yama (God of death). By the sounds of roaring that emerged at the departure of the Rakshasas all beings of Lanka shrieked in unnatural ways. The birds living on flesh and blood reached the sky and circled anticlockwise around the chariot. A meteor fell from the sky, the wind blew violently. Jackals howled vomiting tongues of fire. The planets clashing with one another did not shine. The clouds were violent like donkeys and rained blood on top of the chariot and the marching Rakshasas drenched. The planets clashing with one another did not shine. The clouds were violent like donkeys and rained blood on top of the chariot and the marching Rakshasas drenched. Seeing a vulture sitting on the banner (of Prahastha) facing south scratching both sides, Prahastha became pale as if the entire prosperity had been snatched away. A charioteer and knower of controlling the horses, the whip slipped many times from his hand. The splendour of Prahastha which is difficult to destroy, disappeared at that moment and the horses stumbled on even ground. Seeing Prahastha, who is well known for his valour coming towards, for war with various weapons, the monkey army stood facing. And when the monkeys took hold of heavy rocks and trees for fighting exceedingly tumultuous clamor arose. The yelling noise of Rakshasas and roaring noise of Vanaras of both armies, who were powerful and seized with speed, who sought the destruction of one another, challenging noises of Rakshasas and Vanaras, highly rejoiced, was heard. The yelling noise of Rakshasas and roaring noise of Vanaras of both armies, who were powerful and seized with speed, who sought the destruction of one another, challenging noises of Rakshasas and Vanaras, highly rejoiced, was heard. Thereafter, perverted Prahastha entered into that army of monkey king grown immensely, to conquer the army, just as moth enters into flame, being at the point of death.    This is the end of the fifty seventh sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Rama seeing Prahastha, the tamer of enemies of terrific valour coming towards him, said to Vibheeshana, having a gentle smile. \"Oh, Broad shouldered Vibheeshana! Who is this Rakshasa of gigantic form coming surrounded by a great army He seems to be a valiant one. Tell me.\" On hearing Raghava's words Vibheeshana replied.\" He is a Rakshasa, by name Prahastha, commander in chief of the army of Rakshasa king. He is widely known for his prowess, conversant with weapons and courageous. He is heroic and a third of the army of Ravana is under his command.\" On hearing Raghava's words Vibheeshana replied.\" He is a Rakshasa, by name Prahastha, commander in chief of the army of Rakshasa king. He is widely known for his prowess, conversant with weapons and courageous. He is heroic and a third of the army of Ravana is under his command.\" The huge army of powerful Vanaras saw Prahastha of terrific prowess, fierce, surrounded by Rakshasas coming towards them roaring. The huge army of powerful Vanaras saw Prahastha of terrific prowess, fierce, surrounded by Rakshasas coming towards them roaring. The Rakshasas rushing towards Vanaras seeking victory, seizing swords, javelins, double edged swords, pikes, mallets, maces, iron bars, spears and bows of different kinds shone brightly. The Rakshasas rushing towards Vanaras seeking victory, seizing swords, javelins, double edged swords, pikes, mallets, maces, iron bars, spears and bows of different kinds shone brightly. The Vanaras burning with desire to fight, for their part went with huge trees in bloom, huge and long rocks. Each of them approached one another with showers of rocks and many arrows and by that a great war happened. In the course of war many Rakshasas killed many Vanara leaders and many Vanaras killed many Rakshasas also. Indeed, some were killed by Rakshasas with pikes, some by javelins, a few with iron bars, and a few were hacked with axes. Few got cut and deprived of life and fell on the ground. Some struck by arrows had their hearts broken into pieces. Few Vanaras cut into two by Rakshasas fell down and few Vanaras fell on the ground sides of the body cleft ceased life. Then the highly enraged Vanaras completely crushed Rakshasas in groups by crushing them on the earth's surface with trees and mountain peaks. Hit by fists and hands that had the impact of thunderbolt, teeth and eyes smashed and fallen out, the Rakshasas vomited blood from their mouth excessively. Tumultuous noise like the roar of lions arose in the battlefield with Vanaras and Rakshasas cries of pain. Following the path of heroes and infuriated, their eyes reeling, the vanaras and rakshasas carried out their deeds without fear. Naranthaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada, Samunnata, all these associates of Prahastha made short work of the monkeys. Rushing at great speed, the Rakshasas and also killing the Vanaras in that way, Dwivida alone struck down Naranthaka with a mountain peak. Dhurmukha monkey uprooting a huge tree holding it in hand killed the Rakshasa Samunnata. Energetic Jambavantha, enraged, took a huge rock, and hurled at the chest of Mahanada who fell down. And thereafter, valiant Tara closed with Kumbhahanu and attacked him with a tree on the head and he lost his life. Then intolerant of the exploit, Prahastha got on to the chariot with bow in hand and caused dreadful havoc among the monkeys. Then the sound of both armies was like an agitated, boundless ocean, whirling round and frightening. In that major conflict, highly furious Prahastha, an expert in war tormented the Vanaras with a stream of arrows. The bodies of Vanaras and Rakshasas strewn on the ground, seemed like mountains had fallen. That battlefield drenched with blood shone bright as though veiled with blossoms of Palasa in the month of Magha. Heaps of slain leaders as banks, broken weapons like large trees, torrents of blood as vast stretch of water, liver and spleens as its mire, scattered entrails as duckweeds, severed trunks and heads as fish, fingers and parts of limbs as grass, crowded with swans in the form of vultures, frequented with cranes in the shape of buzzards, overspread with f at in the form of foam, groans of the wounded for its murmur, difficult to cross for cowards, frequented by swans and cranes, that battlefield of river flowed. The Rakshasas and Vanaras swam across the river even though it were difficult to cross as leaders of elephant herds would cross a lotus pond covered with pollen of lotuses.

The Rakshasas and Vanaras swam across the river even though it were difficult to cross as leaders of elephant herds would cross a lotus pond covered with pollen of lotuses. Further Nila saw Prahastha seated and trembling and discharging a volley of arrows with vehemence exterminating monkeys. Prahastha, the commander of the army darted, just as the violent wind blows away mass of clouds, observing Nila coming towards him, in his chariot which was bright as the sun. Prahastha, the commander of the army darted, just as the violent wind blows away mass of clouds, observing Nila coming towards him, in his chariot which was bright as the sun. Prahastha, the CommanderinChief of the army, supreme among wielders of bow, stretched his best bow and drew it and began to discharge arrows at Neela. The arrows discharged by Prahastha, penetrated piercing into Nila's body at great speed like infuriated serpents and went straight into the earth. Great Vanara, a valiant one, Nila having been hit with arrows sharp as tongues of fire, struck Prahastha, who is most difficult to encounter and rushing towards him by uprooting a tree. Great Vanara, a valiant one, Nila having been hit with arrows sharp as tongues of fire, struck Prahastha, who is most difficult to encounter and rushing towards him by uprooting a tree. Having been struck by Nila, the Rakshasa leader became furious, and began to roar and showered rain arrows on the monkeys. Not able to check the volley of arrows released by the Rakshasa, Nila received them with closed eyes. Just as a mighty bull faces sudden downpour of autumnal rain, in the same way Nila precisely tolerated the rain of arrows of Prahastha, which are difficult to face, with eyes closed. Neela endowed with great prowess, became angry (by the rain of arrows showered on him) and hurled a huge Sala tree at Prahastha. Thereupon, Neela firmly holding the bow of mighty Prahastha broke it again and again and roared Deprived of bow and chariot, Prahastha, the CommanderinChief seizing a terrific mallet jumped down from the chariot. Both Nila and Prahastha, deadly enemies, CommanderinChief of the armies, their limbs disfigured, wetted with blood, stood like elephants. Tearing up each other with exceedingly sharp teeth they were behaving like a lion and tiger. They had won many wars and never turned back in war. They were heroes like Vrta and Indra desiring to conquer and attain fame. Tearing up each other with exceedingly sharp teeth they were behaving like a lion and tiger. They had won many wars and never turned back in war. They were heroes like Vrta and Indra desiring to conquer and attain fame. Then Prahastha struck speedily with a mallet and hit Neela on the forehead and blood flowed from there. Then drenched with blood, Neela was enraged and took hold of a huge tree and hurled at the chest of Prahastha. He (Prahastha), not caring for the wound, taking a huge mallet went towards that courageous monkey (Neela). Then, seeing Prahastha waging and coming towards him, the great monkey, Neela, endowed with high speed threw a huge rock. Fighting with the mallet, Neela quickly dropped the rock on that Prahastha's forehead Hurled by Neela, the foremost of monkeys, the huge rock broke the head of Prahastha into pieces. Life, splendour, strength, and senses departed Prahastha fell instantly on the ground like a tree cut at the bottom. From his shattered head much blood flowed from all over the body just as a spring from a mountain. Prahastha having been killed by Neela, the cheerless Rakshasas and unshakeable troops could not stay there any more. The CommanderinChief having been killed the troops could not remain there just as water reached a breached dam. CommanderinChief killed, those Rakshasas reduced to speechlessness went to the abode of their Lord and remained without consciousness.",
                "Commander in chief of the Rakshasa army killed by Neela, the bull of Vanaras, the army Rakshasas with dreadful weapons which were like the fury of an ocean, ran. Having gone to the king of Rakshasas, the survivors said, \"Prahastha is killed by the son of fire god.\" Thereafter, the king of Rakshasas fell prey to anger. Even as Rakshasas revealed about Prahastha's death, tormented by grief and anger Ravana spoke to Rakshasa troops just as Indra spoke to celestial troops. \"No low opinion to be entertained with regard to an enemy by whom my commander in chief of the army was killed, who is capable of killing the army of Indra with his followers and elephants.\" \"I shall go myself without thinking to that wonderful battle scene and put an end to the enemy and succeed.\" \"Now I will go and burn up that army of Vanaras along with Lakshmana and Rama with the stream of my arrows just as forest fire without the use of fire.\" Ravana, the enemy of the king of Devatas, having spoken like that ascended a chariot yoked to the best of horses, shining by virtue of its form (golden) and luminous like fire. As the foremost king of the Rakshasas went forth, a blast of sounds of conchs, beat of drums and clapping of arms and the roaring sounds followed by the chanting of auspicious verses sung by the Rakshasas eulogizing and honouring the king highly. The Rakshasa king surrounded by Rakshasas who resembled mountains and clouds in form seemed like Rudra surrounded by asuras. Thereafter, Ravana possessed with great splendour stopped at the city and saw the army of Vanaras collected together looking like an ocean of clouds wielding trees and rocks. Rama, whose arms were like the king of serpents, shining with splendour, followed by army, seeing the army of Rakshasas exceedingly furious, spoke to Vibheeshana the foremost of the wielder of weapons. \"Under whose command is this unshakeable army with several kinds of flags, posts and weapons armed with missiles, tridents, swords spikes and darts, with elephants the size of Mahendra mountain\" Thereupon, Vibheeshana, equal to Indra in valour, on hearing the great soul Rama, revealed about the Rakshasa army endowed with great strength. \"O King! the one seated on the elephant, by whose weight the elephant head is shaking, whose coppery face is like the rising sun, a gigantic one is Akampana.\" \"The one on the chariot, distinguished by the sign of a lion, and making sound with his bow, splendid as Indra's bow with terrific teeth projected forward looks like an elephant, eminent by virtue of the boons bestowed is Indrajith by name.\" \"He who resembles Vindhya Mountain in the west (where the sun sets) and the Mahendra mountain (in size) seated on the chariot, is a great chariotwarrior, a hero unequalled in size, wielding a bow whose body is grown out of size, who is coming in sight is by name Atikaya.\" \"He whose eyes are coppery red in anger, who rides on elephant resembles the beating of bells, roars in harsh tone are a great courageous one by the name Mahodara.\" \"He who is mounted on horses decorated with gold shining, like a mountain crowned with cloud, radiant as the Sun holding the shining yokes coming at high speed is by name Pisacha.\" \"He who comes firmly shining like lightning, surpassing thunderbolt in speed, seizing a trident, riding a Lordly bull shining like a mountain is the famous Trisira.\" \"There comes Kumbha whose form is like a cloud in form, whose chest is fleshy and broad. He is fully prepared, coming with a sign of the king of serpents (Vasuki) stretching his bow.\" \"There comes Nikumbha, studded with gold and diamonds, shining and smoky, who is the chief of Rakshasa army seizing an iron club, is capable of wonderful and terrific deeds.\" Again, comes Naranthaka, with multitude of swords and arrows, mounted on top of a chariot with flags, blazing like fire, who fights with mountain peaks. \"One who is surrounded by several hideous forms, like heads of tigers, camels, Lordly elephants and horses, rolling eyes, just as Rudra by his attendants, who is surrounded by Rakshasas and is humbled by the pride of even Devatas, over him shines the white canopy resembling the moon with slender ribs is the king of Rakshasas.\" \"One who is surrounded by several hideous forms, like heads of tigers, camels, Lordly elephants and horses, rolling eyes, just as Rudra by his attendants, who is surrounded by Rakshasas and is humbled by the pride of even Devatas, over him shines the white canopy resembling the moon with slender ribs is the king of Rakshasas.\" \"There is the king of Rakshasas shining like Sun, whose countenance shines with hanging earrings, of terrible form like the Himalayas and Vindhya, who has humbled the pride of Mahendra and Yama.\" Then Rama the scourge of enemies replied Vibheeshana, \"Oh! Ravana! King of Rakshasas is endowed with luminous glory.\" \"Ravana blazing like the sun is difficult to gaze even. His shine is spread all over and not perceptible to discern.\" Among the Devas and Danavas such brilliance is not there. He shines so brightly. \"The great warriors of Ravana fighting in war are like mountains and all fought with mountains and glowing weapons.\" \"The Rakshasa king is surrounded by sharp, furious beings of terrible valour shining like the god of death.\" \"By his good luck, this sinful one has come under my sight. I will give vent to my wrath born of Sita's abduction.\" Indomitable Rama having spoken in that manner, followed by Lakshmana got ready and took out an excellent bow and stood. There upon the great soul, the king of Rakshasas thus spoke to the strong army of Rakshasas, \"Fully complacent, free from any apprehension be stationed at the gates and the buildings of the four main streets.\" \"Coming to know that I am here with you, this side, considering it to be a weak point, the forest dwellers may enter the vacant city and Devastate all united.\" After the counsellors departed from there Ravana pierced through the ocean of Vanaras just as gigantic fish would pierce in the sea. Watching Ravana advancing suddenly on the battlefield with great speed, Sugriva took a huge mountain top and went towards Rakshasa king. Seizing mountain tops whose slopes were filled with trees Sugriva hurled at the night rangers. Watching this Ravana quickly broke them with his arrows fixed with golden shafts. After that slope covered with excellent trees had fallen on the ground and broken, Ravana got readied with an arrow as if for arranging destruction like the spirit of death. Seizing an arrow which shone like sparks of fire and had the speed of wind, nay vied with thunderbolt of Indra in speed, he (Ravana) released an arrow in anger. That arrow released from Ravana's arm, which was hard and sharp as the thunderbolt of Indra, pierced Sugriva just as the sharp thorn edged spear of Guha penetrated Krauncha mountain. That hero (Sugriva) hurt by the arrow lost senses and fell on the ground groaning in the battlefield. Seeing that the Rakshasas shouted joyfully overtaken by evil spirits. Thereafter Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sudamshtra, Rshaba, Jyothimukha and Nala increasing their body size rushed towards the king of Rakshasas. The Rakshasa Lord made the mountain peaks useless by the hundreds of arrows released by him. The streams of arrows with golden shafts could resist the Rakshasas and strike the Vanara king. The Vanara leaders of fierce form torn by the streams of sharp arrows discharged in the three directions fell covering the ground. Those monkeys struck and fallen by the piercing of arrows shrieking went to seek refuge from Rama. The great soul Rama who was holding a bow went seizing it. Lakshmana approached him immediately with folded hands and addressed Rama with words consonant with truth. \"I will exterminate the evil minded Ravana. Oh! noble brother, may I be permitted to complete the task\" Sri Rama, who was highly energetic and truthful in enthusiasm to succeed, told Lakshmana, \"You go and be careful in the battle.\" \"Ravana is a great hero in the battlefield. His valour in war is wonderful. He is angry but none can withstand him in the three worlds.\" \"Remaining alert, apply your arrows in the direction of his arrows. Looking at his arrows carefully, making an effort to protect yourself, set your bow.\" On hearing Raghava's words, son of Sumitra embraced him and offered prayers, paying respects sallied forth for the encounter. He saw Ravana, endowed with round shoulders like elephant trunks, with fierce bow glowing and the broken bodies of Vanaras spread all over. Ravana was showering nets of arrows and instigating vanaras. The son of the wind god, Hanuman, a brilliant one seeing Ravana, obstructed the stream of arrows and darted towards him. Courageous Hanuman seeing the chariot of Ravana lifting his right arm menacing him spoke these words. \"Your life is surely secure from gods, demons, Gandharvas and Yakshas and Rakshasas but you fear Vanaras.\" \"I raised this right arm that way with five branches (five fingers) at you that will expel your subtle self (made up of the five subtle elements) from your body.\" Ravana of truly fierce valour, hearing Hanuman's words, his eyes became blood red and spoke to Hanuman this way. \"O Vanara! Go about without any hesitation. Attain the fame of a Vanara hitting Ravana permanently. Thereafter knowing your prowess, I shall put an end to you.\" Having heard Ravana's words, Hanuman said, \"Think of your son Akshaya killed by me earlier.\" Having spoken that way by Hanuman, the Lord of Rakshasas slapped his hand on Hanuman's chest. Smacked by him (Ravana), Hanuman, a brilliant and intelligent one stood firm for a while and picking up courage, highly enraged struck the enemy of gods with his palm. Thereupon, struck by the great soul, Vanara, the ten headed Ravana was shaken like the earthquake on the mountain together. Ravana hit by hand in that way in a hard manner, the siddhas, demons as well and even Devatas raised their voice. And thereafter, thus spoke extremely energetic Ravana recovering from breath, \"Well done vanara. You are courageous and praiseworthy, my enemy!\" Ravana having spoken in that way, Maruti said \"Oh Ravana! What a shame on my valour, you survived.\" \"O evil minded one, why do you brag You do this once more I will strike you once again with my fist and send you to the abode of Yama.\" Consequent to Maruti speaking like that, Ravana's eyes turned red, burning with anger. The powerful Ravana lifted his right fist instantly and brought it down on his powerful enemy. Consequent to Maruti speaking like that, Ravana's eyes turned red, burning with anger. The powerful Ravana lifted his right fist instantly and brought it down on his powerful enemy. Hit on his chest, Hanuman got hurt again and reeled. Seeing Hanuman's power, overcome with fear, the best charioteer Ravana drove quickly towards Neela. The ten headed indomitable Lord of Rakshasas with his arrows that resembled serpents, dreadful, capable of piercing into vital parts began to strike at Neela, the leader of monkeys. The ten headed indomitable Lord of Rakshasas with his arrows that resembled serpents, dreadful, capable of piercing into vital parts began to strike at Neela, the leader of monkeys. Pressured by the streams of arrows, the monkey leader, Neela single handed took up a peak of a mountain and hurled at the Lord of Rakshasas. Endowed with a great mind and energetic Hanuman became alert and seeking to fight with Ravana, feeling fresh, enraged, looking at Nila said \"It is not correct to attack one who is fighting with another.\" Endowed with a great mind and energetic Hanuman became alert and seeking to fight with Ravana, feeling fresh, enraged, looking at Nila said \"It is not correct to attack one who is fighting with another.\" Ravana, endowed with extraordinary energy attacked that peak hurled by Neela with seven sharp arrows and it fell broken into pieces. On seeing the crushed peak, Neela, the killer of stupendous foes, shone like fire at universal destruction in anger. In the battle Neela hurled Aswakarana, Sala and Mango trees in good bloom and several other trees at Ravana. Ravana broke those trees in return and showered rain of formidable arrows at Neela. When Neela was covered by Ravana's arrows, it was just as clouds cover mountain peaks. Neela reduced his size and landed on top of Ravana's bow. Neela stood on top of the post of the bow of Ravana. On seeing that Ravana was burning in anger while Neela roared. Then, when Ravana was unable to release the arrow from the bow on Neela, who was shifting from the top of the post to the crown. Seeing that Lakshmana, Rama and Hanuman were amazed. Ravana endowed with extraordinary energy was also wonder struck at Neela's agility. Then he took up the shining shaft presided over by fire god. Thereafter, seeing Neela's feat in the war, Ravana was agitated and the Vanaras were cheerful for having achieved their wish and shouted in joy. Provoked by the clamour of the vanaras, Ravana's heart was full of anger and did not know what to do. And then the night ranger Ravana taking up, fitting the arrow charged with fire, looked at Neela resting on top of the bow. Ravana endowed with extraordinary energy said, \"Oh monkey, you are unfair, very tricky and further deceptive.\" \"Oh monkey! You are taking different forms and doing different deeds. If you have the ability, save your life.\" \"The arrow released by me now is charged with a missile and will destroy your life. You have been protecting (changing your forms) your life.\" Speaking like that, Ravana, the king of Rakshasas chanting the mantras and fixing the arrow struck the commander in chief (Neela) of the Vanara army. Struck by the arrow propelled by the missile (of Ravana) on the chest, Neela fell on the ground. By virtue of his father's greatness and his own power, his life did not cease but he fell on the ground. Finding the vanara unconscious the ten headed Ravana who was eager to fight went towards Saumithri in the chariot making sounds that resembled the sound of rattling of clouds. In the midst of the battlefield stood Ravana, intercepting with his glowing bow making loud sounds as though shaking the earth. Saumithri who was not depressed in spirit (by Ravana's attack) addressing Ravana who was stretching his bow said \"Oh! Lord of night rangers, Be aware. You ought not to fight with vanaras.\" Hearing the challenging statement of the king of Rakshasas and hearing the vibrating sound, Saumithri standing close by spoke these wrathful words. \"Oh Raghava! You have come under the path of my sight. You are going to meet your end. You who are perverted in mind, struck by a stream of my arrows will reach the abode of death this very moment.\" Saumithri, not surprised at the screaming of Ravana with his projected teeth, said, \"You are great in sinful action. People of great valour do not display such bluster. Do not shout like that.\" \"Your valour, heroism, strength and prowess are known to me. I stand firmly with bow and arrow come on. What is the use of bragging\" Lakshmana, having spoken in that manner, the Lord of Rakshasas released seven arrows with beautiful plumes. Lakshmana tore them into pieces with sharp pointed and sharpheaded arrows with gold shafts. Seeing the arrows cut down with force broken pieces like coils of serpents, the Lord of Lanka overtaken by anger let go another sharp arrow. The brother of Rama stretched his bow into a circle and showered rain of piercing arrows. He tore the arrows of his enemy with his arrows Kshura, Ardhachandra, karni and Balan without nay, perturbance. Ravana, the enemy of gods seeing all his streams of arrows ineffective, was astonished at Lakshmana's skill, and let go sharp arrows again and again. Lakshmana also, who is comparable to Mahendra, fitting his bow and arrows that shone like fire released sharp and pointed arrows to put an end to Rakshasa king. The Rakshasa king broke into pieces those arrows of Lakshmana and struck him on the forehead with the arrow gifted to him by Brahma, that was bright like the fire at the time of universal destruction. Lakshmana hurt by Ravana's dart, shaken up, seizing the bow feebly with great difficulty regaining consciousness tore the bow of the enemy of Indra into pieces in return. Then Lakshmana son of Dasaratha, struck the bow of the king into pieces with three sharp and pointed arrows. The king swooned and recovered with great difficulty. Hurt by the arrows, bow cut, bathed in blood, limbs splattered with fat, Ravana the enemy of gods, himself being endowed with formidable energy gifted by the Self born creator seized javelin on the battlefield. The Lord of the world of Rakshasas instantly flung javelin, emitting fire without smoke, on Saumithri, which created fear among Vanaras. Lakshmana, the brother of Bharata struck the fierce weapon coming towards him like flames of fire fuelled by ghee, even then it struck him on his broad chest. Lakshmana the eminent hero of Raghu's was badly hurt by the javelin and was burning in pain. King Ravana caught him who was losing consciousness, violently and held him by his shoulders. It may be possible to lift Himalayas, Mandara, Meru mountains or even the Devatas of the three worlds but not possible to lift Lakshmana by shoulders. Even though Saumithri was wounded in the chest and the power of Brahma entered (into his chest) he recalled himself as an inconceivable form of Vishnu. Thereafter, Ravana the enemy of Devatas was not capable of lifting Lakshmana's shoulders. Lakshmana could crush the pride of Rakshasas. Then the son of the wind god, enraged, came towards Ravana. Full of anger, he struck him with his thunderbolt like fist on the chest of Ravana. By the blow of Hanuman's fist, Ravana the Lord of Rakshasas was shaken and fell on the ground on his knees. Much blood flowed from his(Ravana's) mouth, ears, and eyes. Rolling in the hind part of the chariot he became still and sank. Ravana of fierce valour having lost senses and waking up from unconscious state, perturbed, did not know where he was. Seeing this the sages, even Vanaras, the demons as well as Devatas shouted in joy. Brilliant Hanuman holding Lakshmana wounded by Ravana in both shoulders brought him to Rama. Lakshmana though unshakeable for enemies, became light for the son of wind god by his friendship and high devotion. That power returned back to Ravana's chariot to its position, leaving Lakshmana, who was difficult to vanquish. Lakshmana who could destroy foes, recovering from unconsciousness, relieved of wounds again remembered himself to be part of Vishnu of immeasurable power. Ravana of mighty prowess waking up from consciousness took over his sharp arrows and the great bow also. Raghava also assailed Ravana seeing the fallen Vanara heroes struck in the combat. And then Hanuman submitted to Rama, \"Just as Lord Vishnu mounted on mighty Garuda, you should also be mounted on my back and subdue Ravana.\" And then Hanuman submitted to Rama, \"Just as Lord Vishnu mounted on mighty Garuda, you should also be mounted on my back and subdue Ravana.\" On hearing the sub mission of Hanuman, Sri Rama, the Lord of humans climbed on the great monkey and saw Ravana on the chariot. Beholding Ravana, highly energetic Rama wielding his bow went furiously towards him just as Lord Vishnu went with his discuss against Virochana. Rama created a sound like a clap of thunder ringing intensely, a majestic one and spoke in a deep voice to the king. \"Oh! Tiger among Rakshasas, forbear, forbear. Having done such an offence to me, where are you going for deliverance\" \"If you go to Indra or Yama or Sun God or the selfborn Brahma or fire God or Shankara or the ten directions like that, and if you run in front of me you cannot escape.\" \"Oh! king of Rakshasa troop! He, who was struck without support now, even if he were to come now in front, you with your sons and grandsons will be struck to death by him.\" \"By me, who is your adversary, fourteen thousand Rakshasas of fierce forms, who had taken abode at Janasthana and used choicest weapons were exterminated.\" On hearing Raghava's words, the mighty strong king of Rakshasas seized with violent anger, recalling earlier enmity, struck with blazing arrows like tongues of fire at the time of universal destruction while Hanuman bore Rama. On hearing Raghava's words, the mighty strong king of Rakshasas seized with violent anger, recalling earlier enmity, struck with blazing arrows like tongues of fire at the time of universal destruction while Hanuman bore Rama. Even though Hanuman was hurt by the arrows discharged by the Rakshasa king, being endowed with energy by nature, his energy went on increasing. Seeing the wounds caused by Ravana to Hanuman, the tiger among monkeys, possibly Rama was seized with anger. Advancing towards him, (Ravana), Rama tore into pieces his chariot, wheels, horses, standard and canopy including the charioteer and the darts and swords. Then with a shining thunderbolt like arrows Rama struck with the weapon of Indra into the fine chest in between the shoulders just as Indra would strike the Meru Mountain with his thunderbolt. He, that heroic king, who was not disturbed hurt by thunderbolt of lightning, was agonized when struck by Rama's arrow and let his bow fall. Seeing Ravana swooning, great soul Rama took up a crescent shaped arrow and hastily broke his crown into pieces which were shining bright red like the Sun. Rama said to the king of Rakshasas, who was like a serpent rid of poison without (head) crown, without splendour like the Sun without brightness, his glory lost with the crown broken in the combat. A great task of killing mighty heroes has been accomplished by you. Therefore, you are exhausted. I declare that I will not send you to death. \"King of night rangers! I know you are agonized after the war. Go to Lanka and rest and reenter, mounted on your chariot with bow. You will witness my strength.\" Rama having spoken in that way (consoling), the king with his vanity and pride crushed, bow broken into pieces, horses and charioteer killed, wounded by arrows, crown broken entered Lanka hastily. After the king of prowlers, the enemy of Danavas and Devas entered Lanka, Rama and Lakshmana also drew out the arrows from monkeys in the forefront of the battlefield and went. The enemy of Indra having been routed, the suras and asuras, the guardians of the four quarters, including the sea, the large serpents, and sages so also the creatures of land and water were joyful.   This is the end of the fifty ninth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then the king of Lanka after entering the city of Lanka, felt humiliated by Rama's arrow, vanity crushed and had lost control over his senses. Overcome by humiliation from the high souled Rama, Ravana remained like an elephant rejected by a lion and a serpent rejected by Garuda. The Lord of Rakshasas remained disquieted recalling the arrows of Rama which emitted light like lightning, resembling Brahmadanda. Ravana seated on the wonderful golden magnificent throne gazing at Rakshasas spoke these words. \" All the penance which I have done, and the asceticism practised by me equal to Mahendra has become purposeless and defeated.\" The dreadful words of Brahma spoken to me\" know that danger from humans is coming to be true. \"I sought protection from Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas and serpents but not asked for protection from humans.\" \"I think that Dasaratha's son Rama, a human being is about whom king Anaranya born in Ikshvaku race, who cursed me earlier saying, 'In my race will be born a man who will kill you in war, with your sons, your horses, charioteers, all army, O evil minded lowest of Rakshasas, and the vilest of Rakshasas.\" \"I think that Dasaratha's son Rama, a human being is about whom king Anaranya born in Ikshvaku race, who cursed me earlier saying, 'In my race will be born a man who will kill you in war, with your sons, your horses, charioteers, all army, O evil minded lowest of Rakshasas, and the vilest of Rakshasas.\" \"In the past, I violated Vedavathi and got cursed by her. The same Woman born as Sita, the daughter of Janaka, is a highly blessed one.\" \"Uma, Nandeeswara, Rambha and daughter of Varuna have cursed me like that and the prediction of those endowed with vision has been attained by me.\" \"Knowing all this, make effort doing what ought to be done and let the Rakshasas strive to succeed positioned on top of the gates.\" \"Let Kumbhakarna of unparalleled profundity, capable of crushing Devas and Danavas, who is in slumber owing to the curse of Brahma be awakened.\" \"Let him be instructed that Prahastha endowed with mighty prowess has been defeated and killed.\" \"Let the Rakshasas climb up the defensive walls and attempt to guard. Also let Kumbhakarna be aroused from sleep.\" \"The Rakshasa, Kumbhakarna, lost consciousness is slumbering at ease and has been sleeping for six to nine months happily.\" \"Deliberating like this with me, Kumbhakarna is sleeping for the ninth day from now. He may be quickly informed (aroused).\" \"Endowed with broad shoulders, he is the foremost of Rakshasas. He will crush many Vanaras immediately and the two princes (Rama and Lakshmana).\" \"He, (Kumbhakarna) is the foremost chief among all Rakshasas enumerated. In that way he is distinguished. But he is insensate, remains addicted always to indecent delight in the form of sleep.\" \" After Kumbhakarna is fully aroused, my sorrow impelled in this terrible comb at with Rama will not be there.\" \"What can I do if he does not assist me in such a dreadful comb at because of his weakness, even though he is equal to Indra in strength\" On listening to the Rakshasa king's words, the Rakshasas went to the abode of Kumbhakarna highly puzzled. The Rakshasas entered the beautiful residence of Kumbhakarna which was one yojana on all sides with huge gates, taking fragrant garlands and foods (to wake up Kumbhakarna) from where they were pushed out by the breath of Kumbhakarna. The Rakshasas endowed with mighty strength pushed their way into the residence of Kumbhakarna and entered. The Rakshasas entered the beautiful residence of Kumbhakarna which was one yojana on all sides with huge gates, taking fragrant garlands and foods (to wake up Kumbhakarna) from where they were pushed out by the breath of Kumbhakarna. The Rakshasas endowed with mighty strength pushed their way into the residence of Kumbhakarna and entered. The tigers among Rakshasas entered the residence paved with gold and precious stones, a delightful one and saw sleeping Kumbhakarna of great prowess. Those Rakshasas collected together started to awaken Kumbhakarna, who was like a scattered mountain in dead sleep. The Rakshasas saw Kumbhakarna, destroyer of enemies, the tiger of the southwest, tamer of foes, with his body fully covered with bristling hair, breathing heavily like a serpent with horrible nostrils, turning back with facemouth as vast as underworld all limbs stretched out, emitting smell of fat and blood, arms adorned with gold bracelets, wearing a crown, and sleeping. The Rakshasas saw Kumbhakarna, destroyer of enemies, the tiger of the southwest, tamer of foes, with his body fully covered with bristling hair, breathing heavily like a serpent with horrible nostrils, turning back with facemouth as vast as underworld all limbs stretched out, emitting smell of fat and blood, arms adorned with gold bracelets, wearing a crown, and sleeping. The Rakshasas saw Kumbhakarna, destroyer of enemies, the tiger of the southwest, tamer of foes, with his body fully covered with bristling hair, breathing heavily like a serpent with horrible nostrils, turning back with facemouth as vast as underworld all limbs stretched out, emitting smell of fat and blood, arms adorned with gold bracelets, wearing a crown, and sleeping. Thereafter the Rakshasas placed a heap of me at the size of Meru Mountain to please him immensely. The tigers of the south west Rakshasas piled up a mass of marvellous food like the me at of buffaloes, swine, and antelopes. Then the Rakshasas placed thirty three kinds of meat, pails of blood, and a variety of wines in front of Kumbhakarna. Again, they daubed Kumbhakarna with highly fragrant sandal paste to take in fragrance, with wonderful garlands and perfumes. They also burnt incense, sandal to send forth fragrance to gratify Kumbhakarna and thundered like clouds here and there. They blew moon size conches shining brightly. Intolerant Rakshasas raised loud noise simultaneously. Those night rangers drawing the limbs of Kumbhakarna pushed his arms, clapping loudly to awaken him making a sound. On hearing the conchs, and of the clapping of arms, and thundering like a lion, the birds playing in the sky got scattered and fell. Kumbhakarna sleeping like that, could not be awakened. Angry Rakshasas roared and hit him with mallets and maces. Then the excited Rakshasas could not wake up Kumbhakarna happily sleeping on the ground in spite of hitting with rocks and trees and their fists. Unable to bear the force of the breathing out of Kumbhakarna, the Rakshasas could not stand. The Rakshasas of terrible valour resorted to abandoned drums and tom toms that way and pails of clay. Ten thousand Rakshasas surrounded him all at once like a mass of antimony striking him and even made a loud noise. But he never responded. They called him again and again, but he never got up. Then they made a difficult and dreadful effort approaching him. They urged horses, elephants, camels, and donkeys to pounce on him, whipping with staff, whips, and goads. The city of Lanka including the woods was filled with that noise. They pushed him with mallets with all their strength, but he did not wake up. All Lanka and mountains were filled by the great noise made by the Rakshasas. Even then Kumbhakarna did not wake up. Then was collected a thousand drums and beaten with polished gold sticks on all sides continuously. Wrapped in sleep like that because of the spell of the curse, he had not wakened. The Rakshasas got enraged. All the Rakshasas endowed with mighty prowess became enraged and others started to arouse with all their strength. While some were beating the drums, some shouted at the pitch of their voice, some started pulling his hair and some bit his ears. Some poured hundreds of pails of water into ears, distressed that he did not wake up under the spell of deep sleep. Some had their nails fixed with mallets, letting their mallets fall on the forehead, on the chest and throw at of Kumbhakarna. Some struck with sataghni (mace) all over his huge body fastened with cords. A thousand elephants were made to walk over his body. Then Kumbhakarna felt the touch but did not understand. Tormented by hunger and hit by mountain peaks and huge trees he sprang up suddenly descended and awakened. Kumbhakarna, devoid of any beauty threw out his limbs which were like the coils of cobra and as hard as mountain tops, his mouth was unnatural like a submarine fire as he yawned. As he yawned his mouth resembling the underworld, it was like the Sun rose over the top of Mount Meru. As the mighty night ranger awakened and yawned continuously his breath was like wind blowing from the mountain. As Kumbhakarna woke up he appeared like the time spirit at the time of dissolution of the universe like a rainy cloud at twilight as if seeking to consume all beings. His huge eyes were like blazing fire dazzling like lightning glowing like two huge planets. Thereafter having seen several kinds of food items of hogs, buffaloes he ate them. After eating the meat and feeling thirsty, the enemy of Indra drank blood, pails of fat and wine. There upon the night rangers realizing that he got up, came before him, and greeted him with heads bent down. With sleepy eyes casting his glance at the night rangers looked at all of them. He, the bull among the south west region, astonished at his awakening, soothed, and spoke to all the Rakshasas in this way. \"What have you done to wake me Hope King is fine and has no fear of danger\" \"Is there any fear of some enemies Is it because of that you have woken me up Let me know.\" \"I will devour Rakshasa king's fear. I will eradicate even Mahendra (mountain) or alleviate fire.\" \"For a small reason he will not awaken me. Tell me the reason truly for waking me.\" Kumbhakarna, tamer of enemies having spoken in that way in anger, Yupaksha, a minister joined palms and replied to him. \"O King! there is no danger from Devas. Only a small destruction done by a human is pressing and causing pain.\" \"O King! This kind of fear from humans has not arisen for us either from Daityas or Danavas.\" This Lanka is seized by a mountain like army of Vanaras. By the abduction of Sita, there is little fear from Rama. \"Earlier this great city was burnt by a single Vanara who killed Prince Aksha, and his elephants and followers.\" \"Rakshasa king, scion of sage Paulastya, an enemy of Devatas, was let off from death by Rama who has the splendour of Sun.\" \"The king could escape from the verge of death and such an act was never done by Daityas or Danavas earlier in the encounter.\" On hearing the words of Yupaksha, regarding the insult of his brother Kumbhakarna said this rolling his eyes. \"I will conquer now the Vanara army along with Lakshmana and Raghava in war and see Ravana.\" \"I will satisfy the Rakshasas with the flesh and blood of Rama and Lakshmana. You will see.\" Hearing the words of the reply of Kumbhakarna, filled with arrogance and pride, Mahodara, chief of the army, submitted with folded hands and said. \"O Mighty Armed One! You hear from Ravana the advantages and disadvantages and thereafter assess the enemy to conquer.\" Kumbhakarna of extraordinary energy, mighty strong, on hearing Mahodara went in surrounded by Rakshasas. After rousing up Kumbhakarna of frightful eyes and fierce strength from sleep the Rakshasas quickly went to the abode of the ten headed king. All those night rangers, approaching the tenheaded king seated on an excellent se at greeted with folded hands and said. \"O Rakshasa Lord! Your brother Kumbhakarna has come here. Greetings to you. Tell us what to do.\" Ravana on his part said this to the Rakshasas feeling cheerful. \"Honour him as propriety demands. I wish to see him.\" All the Rakshasas taking leave from Ravana said this again approaching Kumbhakarna. All the Rakshasa leaders said to Kumbhakarna,\" the king desires to see you. Start. Make up your mind. Be pleased to depart to your brother.\" Formidable and courageous Kumbhakarna also got up from sleep saying 'yes' and rose up. Joyful Kumbhakarna, washed his face, had a bath and being thirsty ordered a drink that can increase his strength. By the order of Ravana hurriedly they got several kinds of wine in pots. (Kumbhakarna) Having drunk two thousand pots of wine, slightly excited and inebriated and replenished with strength and energy was ready to depart. Kumbhakarna surrounded by Rakshasas going to his brother's abode happily looked like the Lord of death bent on destroying the creation. He took strides which shook the earth. Kumbhakarna went like the thousand rayed Sun illuminating the earth by his splendour brightening the royal path, greeted by a circle of Rakshasas joining palms like Indra who has done a hundred sacrifices went to the abode of selfborn Brahma. And then the Vanaras and the leaders of the Vanara army who were present looked at the immeasurably tall form of Kumbhakarna walking through the royal path and got alarmed. Indeed, some took refuge from Rama who could give shelter, some fell down in panic, some went in all directions in panic, and some out of fear lay down on the ground. Oppressed with fear the Vanaras ran here and there seeing the form of Kumbhakarna that was like the peak of a mountain as if touching the selfluminous Sun, crowned and wonderful, grown in size.    This is the end of the sixtieth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On taking up a bow Rama saw Kumbhakarna of extraordinary energy, prodigious, and of large body, adorned with a crown. That foremost of Rakshasas was like a mountain in appearance, it was like Lord Narayana taking steps to the sky earlier. Seeing the Rakshasa who was like a rainy cloud with water, decked with gold ornaments, the commander in chief of Vanaras ran. Seeing the army scared away and the army of Rakshasas growing in size, Rama was astonished and thus spoke to Vibheeshana. \"Who is that hero resembling a mountain, a crowned one with tawny eyes, looking like a rainy cloud driven by lightning? He is seen in Lanka.\" \"He is seen here like a lone comet on earth. Seeing him the Vanaras are fleeing hither and thither.\" \"Who is he, that gigantic Rakshasa? Is he a demon or perhaps a colossus? No such being was seen by me earlier.\" Asked by the prince Rama, of unwearied action, highly intelligent Vibheeshana spoke. \"Vyvasvatha (Lord of death) as well as Vasava (Indra) were defeated by him in war. He is Kumbhakarna, the son of sage Visrava, a stupendous one and there is no other Rakshasa who equals him in size.\" \"O Raghava! In war Devas, Danavas, Yakshas, Nagas, ogres, Gandharvas, Vidydharas, Kinneras in thousands were defeated by him.\" \"This Kumbhakarna with pike in hand and fierce eyes, is mighty strong. All the Devatas could not kill him, deluded that he is death personified.\" \"Kumbhakarna is by nature (by birth) energetic and mighty. The strength of other Rakshasas is on account of their boons received by them.\" \" As soon as he was born, he was hungry and this great soul being strong consumed thousands of created beings.\" \"In that way when Kumbhakarna was devouring, out of fear all people sought the refuge of Indra and represented.\" \"Mahendra who was armed with thunderbolt got enraged and hurt Kumbhakarna with thunderbolt. He reeled and roared with the strike.\" \"People were already afraid of Kumbhakarna, and after hearing the lion roar of this Rakshasa they were even more scared.\" \"Then mighty Kumbhakarna, who was enraged, pulled out the tusk of Airavatham and struck at the chest of Indra.\" \"Hit by Kumbhakarna Indra felt tormented. The Devatas, Brahmarshis and Danavas became despondent. Accompanied by created beings they complained to Brahma.\" \"They reported to Brahma about Kumbhakarna's ruthless deeds, devouring created beings, insulting, harsh and also destroying the abodes of sages violently and abducting others' wives.\" \"They reported to Brahma about Kumbhakarna's ruthless deeds, devouring created beings, insulting, harsh and also destroying the abodes of sages violently and abducting others' wives.\" \"If he consumes created beings every day like that, in the course of time the world will be devoid of beings.\" Hearing the words of Indra, Brahma conjured the Rakshasas and saw Kumbhakarna with them. \"Beholding Kumbhakarna, Brahma was alarmed and spoke to him to restore the confidence of Kumbhakarna.\" \"Surely you are begotten by Paulastya for the destruction of the universe. Therefore, remain sleeping like a dead one from today, ' said Brahma and cursed him.\" \"Thereafter, by the curse of Lord Brahma, Kumbhakarna fell in front. Highly agitated at this Ravana spoke these words to Brahma.\" \"Oh Brahma! Cutting a golden tree at the stage of fruiting is not fair. It is not proper for you to curse your great grandson in that way.\" \"Your words will not become untrue, no doubt. Sleep, he must but waking time may be fixed.\" On hearing Ravana's words, Brahma said\" He will sleep for six months and stay awake for a day.\" \"This hero will open his mouth wide and move about and alone he will consume the world like the swollen fire.\" \"Overtaken by worry, the king out of fear of your prowess just awakened sleeping Kumbhakarna.\" \"This heroic Kumbhakarna has come out of his residence extremely angry and going to and from to consume all Vanaras.\" \"On merely seeing Kumbhakarna, the monkeys are running away. How will they check him who is enraged in war?\" \"Let all the Vanaras be told, that this one standing high is a machine then the Vanaras will not be scared of victory.\" Hearing the words of Vibheeshana, which was reasonable and, in their favour, Raghava said this to Nila, the commander in chief of the army. \"Pavaka, go and organize all the army and get together to occupy all the gates, highways, bridges in Lanka.\" \"Be ready staying on mountain tops, trees, rocks armed with weapons and rocks in hand.\" As instructed by Raghava, the monkey leader Nila, elephant among the monkeys, ordered the monkey troops as instructed. Then taking mountains, Gavaksha, Sarabha, Hanuman, Angada who looked like mountains themselves marched to the gate. The monkeys desiring to be triumphant, took trees and began to strike at the enemies on hearing Rama's control. Then Vanaras taking trees and mountains in their shining hand s marching close to each other seemed like a huge mass of terrible clouds hanging close to a mountain.   This is the end of the sixty first sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "He (Kumbhakaran), who was endowed with indomitable prowess, a tiger among Rakshasas, was sleepy and inebriated, marched along the splendid royal path. Then, Kumbhakarna, who is very difficult to win over, walked violently surrounded by Rakshasas, covered with showers of flowers from houses. He saw the vast abode of the king of Rakshasas, with lattice work of gold and looking bright like the morning Sun He saw entering the abode of Lord of Rakshasas like the Sun penetrating into a mass of clouds, from a distance his elder brother seated on the throne just like Indra saw the SelfBorn Brahma on the throne. While Kumbhakarna accompanied by troops of Rakshasas, was taking strides to his brother's abode, even the earth was shaken. Having gone to his brother's residence, stepping into the enclosure, he saw his brother seated in a perturbed state. The ten headed Ravana seeing Kumbhakarna, was delighted and got up quickly and made him come close to him. Getting up from his seat, Kumbhakarna endowed with extraordinary might bowed down and clasped his brother's feet and asked him, what task he had to do? Getting up from his seat Ravana embraced and greeted Kumbhakarna. So also, he duly rejoiced and occupied the seat. Mighty Kumbhakarna, duly took the seat. Enraged Ravana with blood shot eyes spoke these words. \"O King! For what purpose have I been awakened by you? Whom are you fearing? I wish to know who is to be ceased in life?\" Kumbhakarna, was overcome with anger, and asked his brother Ravana, who was seated and rolling his eyes in anger. \"Oh! Kumbhakarna of extraordinary prowess! You were asleep for long happily. You do not know that I am afraid of Rama.\" \"Rama, the son of Dasaratha accompanied by Sugriva, crossed the ocean with an army that was cutting our roots.\" \" Alas! You see how the Vanaras, arriving at Lanka, crossing the bridge have done away with groves and gardens.\" \"Of the Rakshasas, the chiefs have been killed in war by Vanaras. But I did not see even one Vanara to have been killed in war. Vanaras have not failed to succeed in war.\" \"Of the Rakshasas, the chiefs have been killed in war by Vanaras. But I did not see even one Vanara to have been killed in war. Vanaras have not failed to succeed in war.\" \"Mighty strong I am, but such is the fear that has been created in me from them. You have been awakened, to destroy them. Reported Ravana.\" \" All resources of mine are exhausted. These children and aged are only left in Lanka city, knowing that you will save the city of Lanka.\" \"O broad shouldered brother! Do this task which is difficult for others. O Scourge of enemies! I have not asked you before for such a task.\" \"O Bull among Rakshasas! Being my brother, do this for me. I always have affection for you. Considering that you have encountered war with Devas and Asuras and won both Devas and Asuras, do this help.\" \"O Brother of fierce valour! Get up. I have not seen anyone stronger than you among all beings.\" \"You are a lover of wars. You are a lover of relations. You are always my dear well wisher. O self glorious one! Do this task of throwing out the torrent army just like wind throws rainy clouds.\"    This is the end of the sixty second sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the lament of the Rakshasa king, Kumbhakarna replied laughing. \"While we were discussing earlier and taking decisions, that disaster foreseen by me has reaped for having not trusted the well wishers.\" \"Those who do sinful deeds fall unobstructed so also the fruit of your sinful action has come upon you.\" \"O king! All this action was not thought of at the beginning, nor the consequences of action weighed in the pride of your prowess.\" \"Confident of prosperity, he who defers action earlier, he does not know what is right and wrong later on.\" \" Actions performed without regard for time and place will be disastrous like the oblations offered into fire without consecration, gets wasted.\" He who thinks with ministers and considers the five aspects of threefold duties and moves in the right path performs (Five aspects of action are the method of initiating action, material to be worked upon, time and place of action, provision against mischance and the chances of success). Threefold duties with reference to enemies are Sama, Daana, and Bedha.\" \"The king who does his duty in time in accordance with justice and thinking intelligently with his ministers, understands rightly.\" \"O Rakshasa king! A man should pursue his duty or worldly gain or sensual pleasures all the three combined or at least any two in time (the scriptures lay down that duty should be pursued in the morning, wealth in the afternoon and sensual pleasures at night).\" \" A sovereign king or a king hearing these three does not recognize the best of the three is in vain even though he heard many.\" \"You are the foremost of the Rakshasas! After discussing with ministers, a king either by gifting or conciliation or dissension or resorting to all of them at the appropriate time takes resort to pursue virtue, wealth, or sensual pleasures at the right time, never meets with sorrow.\" \"You are the foremost of the Rakshasas! After discussing with ministers, a king either by gifting or conciliation or dissension or resorting to all of them at the appropriate time takes resort to pursue virtue, wealth, or sensual pleasures at the right time, never meets with sorrow.\" \"That king who knows the reality of things and makes decisions in consultation with his ministers, who make their living with their intelligence will live happily.\" \"People whose intelligence level is no better than animals, who have been included to express their views, who do not know the meaning of shastras express their views out of impudence.\" \"Those who have no knowledge of shastras are ignorant of the science of wealth and desire huge wealth. Their advice ought not to be followed.\" \"Those who tender advice, which is unwholesome but in wholesome grab, out of their impudence should be kept away from discussion examining early as they mar the purpose.\" \"Some ministers in order to ruin the king, collide with enemies and make the king take wrong actions.\" \" A ruler should know those ministers bribed by the enemy, who have become close to the enemy and appear as friends. Those ministers must be known through their behaviour in the deliberations.\" \"Enemies find out the weakness of the king who is unsteady and rush after the actions forcibly without thinking like brahmins just as birds find the holes in Krauncha mountain and elaborate to others.\" \"He who knowing fully the actions of the enemy does not protect himself he attains reverses and is also dragged down from position.\" \"The advice given to you in the past by your brother alone is good. That is good for you. Or you may do what you wish.\" Kumbhakarna having spoken that way, the ten headed Ravana frowned, shaking his eyebrows in anger and spoke this way. \"Why do you, who are worthy of respect, instruct me like a father or teacher? These words express your cleverness in speaking. It is time to do what is appropriate now. Follow what is to be done.\" \"Due to delusion, or lack of understanding or due to pride of my strength I did something. To talk of it now again is futile.\" \"You may speak of only what is proper to do now. Do not think of the past as it is gone.\" \"If at all there is any affection in you for me now, you recognize your strengths and think what action is justified in your heart. You may nullify the evil that sprung from my heart.\" \" A friend is one who helps when one's fortune is lost and is desperate. Deviating from morals the one who is prepared to help is a relation.\" Thereafter knowing that Ravana is agitated and arguing in a grave and harsh manner, Kumbhakarna, spoke slowly in a gentle tone. Sensing that Ravana is disturbed very much, Kumbhakarna taking hold of the brother and consoling him slowly said these words. \"Listen to my words, Rakshasa king! You are a scourge of enemies. Put aside this sorrow. Give up the agony also. Be normal. You ought to be your normal self again.\" \"Listen to my words, Rakshasa king! You are a scourge of enemies. Put aside this sorrow. Give up the agony also. Be normal. You ought to be your normal self again.\" \"While I am (my body is) with life you need not entertain despondency. I will exterminate him, by whose account you are agitated.\" \"O king! I will give you good advice in all circumstances being a relation. Salutary advice has been given to you out of brotherly affection.\" \" At this time, you will see a relation doing that which is right out of affection. All enemies will be destroyed.\" \"O mighty armed King! You see Rama along with his brother being killed by me and Vanaras fleeing away from the forefront of war.\" \"Be happy today, O Mighty armed brother! I will bring Rama's head from the battlefield. Sita will be sad. You will see.\" \" All the Rakshasas in Lanka whose relations have been killed will witness Rama's death which will be very welcome.\" Now I will wipe the tears of Rakshasas who lost their kin and are bewailing their loss. \"Now you will see Sugriva the foremost of monkeys in mountain shape, resembling mountains bathed in blood like evening Sun illumined like the cloud.\" \"O Sinless Ravana! As I am going to kill this son of Dasaratha whom Rakshasas are intending to kill, how can Rama kill you now?\" \"Rakshasa king! Raghava will kill you only after killing me. Never give way for distress.\" \"Command me to wage war at this moment, O Scorcher of enemies. There is no one better than me to be sought for O hero endowed with extraordinary strength.\" \"I shall exterminate your enemies, however mighty they may be. I can contend with Indra or fire god or Yama or wind god, Kubera or even Varuna.\" \"Even Indra with a body as big as a mountain, with pointed teeth like a spike, with sharp teeth will fear me and run if I roar. \"Or else giving up weapons and swords using my arms indeed I can crush, and no one can stand in front of me.\" \"I shall not fight with javelin or mace or sword or sharp arrows. Enraged, alone I can strike down even Indra.\" \"Now if that Raghava can withstand the force of my fists, you will see volleys of Rama's arrows will drink my blood.\" \"O King! while I am here for what reason do you worry and have anxiety? I will go now and decidedly destroy your enemy.\" \"O King! Give up the fear, as both Rama and Lakshmana will be made short of work in the battlefield, as also mighty Sugriva and dispose of Hanuman, the destroyer of many Rakshasas and who set fire to Lanka.\" \"O King! Give up the fear, as both Rama and Lakshmana will be made short of work in the battlefield, as also mighty Sugriva and dispose of Hanuman, the destroyer of many Rakshasas and who set fire to Lanka.\" \"I will remain steady in the battlefield and devour monkeys also. I wish to confer an unusual and great glory on you.\" \"Even if there is fear of Indra and Brahma that haunts you, I shall destroy them away like the sun dispels darkness. Devas will fall flat on earth when I am enraged.\" \"I shall quell Lord Yama also, devour fire god, make the Sun including stars fall on earth.\" \"I shall kill Indra who has done a hundred sacrifices, drink up the ocean the abode of Varuna, crush the mountains totally, and break the earth.\" \" All beings all over will be eaten now. For a long time Kumbhakarna was sleeping. Now you will see that the food of all the three worlds, earth, heaven and intermediate region will not be enough to fill my stomach.\" \" All beings all over will be eaten now.

I will collect Rama along with Lakshmana and all the Vanara leaders and devour all.\"",
                "Hearing the words of mighty Kumbhakarna, of massive body and round arms Mahodara said. \"Kumbhakarna!

They are incompatible with what you said and that it is its nature you said. what is the proof?\" \" Actions alone are the means of happiness. Being so how can sinful actions accrue good results?\" \" All virtues and worldly pleasures and even otherwise give only benefit. But if done with disinterest and unrighteousness it can give a result which is other than prosperity.\" \" All beings reap the fruit of their actions in this world as well as in other worlds. He, who remains to be pleasure seeking, devoted to actions will receive blessings and attain pleasures in this life only (not here after).\" \" At that time the king intended in his heart (to abduct Sita), and we approved his action, and it was done. What is wrong in doing such a courageous action against an enemy?\" \"You have set out alone (for war) and the reason adduced by you is ill conceived and improper. I shall tell you.\" \"How is it possible for you single handed to win Raghava of exceeding might, who killed many Rakshasas in the past at Janasthana?\" \"Look! Those highly energetic Rakshasas, who were won by Rama at Janasthana are scared of him even now.\" \"Do you desire to awaken Rama, who is like an enraged lion knowingly, who is like a sleeping snake?\" \"Who can dare to approach Rama, who is difficult to encounter, unbearable and burning in anger like the spirit of death.\" \"Face to face with the enemy this total army will be in danger. You're going alone is certainly not desirable.\" \"How can a weak person desire to go to the enemy who is rich in resources, determined to sacrifice his life several times and submit himself?\" \"O Best of Rakshasas! How would you enter into combat with one who is great among all human beings and while even Indra and Sun God are not equal to him in war?\" Mahodara having spoken to agitated Kumbhakarna in the midst of Rakshasas in this way, submitted to Ravana, who makes people cry. \"Having got Vaidehi, why are you talking like that? Sita will submit to you if you desire.\" \"O King of Rakshasas! A means of bringing her round is known to me. Listen, think over with your intellect.\" \"You pronounce that I, Dwijihva, Samhradri, Kumbhakarna and Vitardana, five of us will go forth to kill Rama.\" \"Thereafter, proceeding forth we shall try to win your enemy. If we win, there will be no purpose for you to do any action.\" \"If our enemy survives in combat, we too will survive and review as we planned and see.\" \"Bathed in blood, wounded by the arrows marked with Rama's name, bodies torn cruelly we will come here from war.\" \"We too will hold your feet saying 'Rama and Lakshmana have been devoured by us'.

                "Kumbhakarna having heard Mahodara, warned him not to speak that way and spoke to Ravana, the foremost of Rakshasas. \"You know me. I will get rid of your enmity killing the cruel minded Rama. Be fearless and happy now.\" \"Warriors will not roar wastefully like waterless clouds. You will see me roaring after having completed the action.\" \"Warriors do not tolerate even when glorified. They never praise themselves. They accomplish difficult deeds without displaying them.\" \"O Mahodara! Your words of appeal will be accepted as cowardly, devoid of intellect and to those who do not know anything, it looks as if you know.\" \"You, who always fear in combat, are talking pleasingly to the king , going after him happily brought the matter to this state.\" \"The king is left alone in Lanka, which is divested of its wealth, and treasury reduced, and the army destroyed by unfriendly people pretending as good friends around him.\" \"I am setting out in this manner to the battlefield, to overpower the enemies in the battle in order to redeem the mistakes done by all of you.\" Wise Kumbhakarna having spoken in that way, the Rakshasa king, Ravana laughed and replied in this way. \"O dear! You are an expert in war! This Mahodara is terrified at Rama. He is not desiring war. There is no doubt.\" \"O Kumbhakarna! There is none who is equal to you in might and friendliness at heart towards me. You go and be victorious by killing the enemies.\" \"You are difficult to encounter. You have awakened for the sake of putting an end to the enemy. It is a momentous period for the Rakshasas, O tamer of enemies.\" \"Therefore, taking up trident holding the noose in hand like the God of Death proceed to devour the monkeys as well as the two princes shining like the Sun.\" \"Seeing your form, the Vanaras will run away, Rama and Lakshmana's heart will break.\" The highly energetic king of Rakshasas having spoken like that to mighty Kumbhakarna, felt as if he had taken birth again. The king who knew the valour and mighty strength of Kumbhakarna remained happy like the moon. The king having spoken these words, mighty Kumbhakarna, pleased with the king's words set forth to fight. The destroyer of enemies, hurriedly seized a whetted flaming iron dart, embellished with polished gold. The dart was like Indra's thunderbolt in form and was equal to thunderbolt, capable of destroying Devas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas and Pannagas, was like rising fire shining like the face of an enemy. It was sharp, wreathed in garlands of red colour and emitting flame. Kumbhakarna wielding the dart said.

It was sharp, wreathed in garlands of red colour and emitting flame. Kumbhakarna wielding the dart said. Enraged and angry Kumbhakarna said, \"I will proceed now. Let my army remain here. I will consume them on keys today.\" Hearing Kumbhakarna's words Ravana said,\" Go with trident, sword and iron bar in hand surrounded by the army.\" \"The Vanaras are gigantic, endowed with speed and determination. They will destroy with their teeth when you are not alert and alone.\" \"Therefore, go surrounded by the army. They are extremely difficult to encounter. They are like thunderbolts. Destroy them who are on the enemy side and not favourable to Rakshasas.\" And then the brilliant Ravana got up from his seat, garlanded Kumbhakarna with garland s of flowers encrusted with gems. Then Ravana placed armlets, rings, exquisite ornaments, garland s of pearls like moonlight on Kumbhakarna's neck. Ravana then placed his crown, wonderful fragrant garlands and rich suspended earrings on Kumbhakarna. Adorned with armlets studded with gems and golden ornaments on his distinguished large ears, Kumbhakarna shone like fire. Adorned with a huge dark girdle, Kumbhakarna seemed like a bright jewel like Mount Mandara used for churning nectar of immortality fastened by Vasuki. Kumbhakarna decked in heavy golden shield (impenetrable by any weapon) and difficult to break, seemed like the lightning with self effulgence, glowing like fire, shone like the evening twilight around the mountain peak. Decked with ornaments on all his limbs, with pike in hand, the Rakshasa was like Narayana ready to take three strides to cover the universe. Endowed with great strength, embraced his brother, went round in reverence bowing down his head and sallied forth. Decked with ornaments on all his limbs, with pike in hand, the Rakshasa was like Narayana ready to take three strides to cover the universe. Endowed with great strength, embraced his brother, went round in reverence bowing down his head and sallied forth. Kumbhakarna, of huge body, of loud voice and highly capable having been dismissed by Ravana, went with the great army after benediction and started observing. Many great warriors seated on the best of chariots, with best of weapons amidst noise of conchs and drums, elephants, horses also and thunder like chariot warriors, started to proceed. On dreadful and mighty serpents, camels, donkeys, horses, lions, antelopes, and birds also the Rakshasas accompanied Kumbhakarna. Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Devas and Danavas determined and eager showered with a rain of flowers, head covered with parasol, excited with drink, wielding sharpened tridents in hand and smeared with blood red fragrant sandal paste, sallied forth in that state. Rakshasas of loud voice, great prowess, and fearful with frightening eyes, lifted the many weapons in hand and followed on foot. Rakshasas with blood red eyes, of huge body size, dark blue in colour, holding tridents, sharpened whetted axes and weapons of many kinds, iron bars and maces, clubs, mallets and palmyra trees, the evil minded vast army set out. Rakshasas with blood red eyes, of huge body size, dark blue in colour, holding tridents, sharpened whetted axes and weapons of many kinds, iron bars and maces, clubs, mallets and palmyra trees, the evil minded vast army set out. Assuming another fearful form, Kumbhakarna who was highly energetic, endowed with mighty strength and frightful in form, which was a hundred bows in breadth and six hundred bows in height, with eyes like wheels of chariot, enraged, seemed like a huge mountain. Assuming another fearful form, Kumbhakarna who was highly energetic, endowed with mighty strength and frightful in form, which was a hundred bows in breadth and six hundred bows in height, with eyes like wheels of chariot, enraged, seemed like a huge mountain. Thus spoke, Kumbhakarna who resembled a charred mountain, with wide mouth, reaching near the Rakshasas, laughing. Thereafter, furious Kumbhakarna said \"Now I will consume all the battalions of Vanaras just as moths are consumed by fire.\" \"These forest rangers have never desired to do any harm to me. This clan serve as ornaments of our gardens.\" \"The root cause of besieging Lanka is Rama and Lakshmana. I will kill them in combat.\" When Kumbhakarna had spoken that way the Rakshasas made noise that was like the sound of an agitated ocean. As wise Kumbhakarna was proceeding swiftly , dreadful portents appeared. The clouds appeared in the colour of donkey and there was thunder and lightning. The oceans, forests and earth seemed as though shaken. She jackals were seen with flaming morsels throwing from their mouths. Birds wheeled in a circular way and settled. On the way as he was going an eagle alighted on his pike. His eyes twitched and left shoulder throbbed. Then a burning meteor fell from the sky making a terrible sound. The sun lost his glow and the wind lost its delight Kumbhakarna went unmindful of the portents which made hair stand on end propelled by the force of destiny. He who resembled a mountain in form, leapt the boundary wall on foot like a cloud and witnessed the amazing Vanara troops. On seeing the mountain like form of the foremost of the Rakshasas. the vanaras dispersed in all directions like clouds swept by the wind. Heavy cloud like Kumbhakarna, a notorious one, perceiving the Vanara troops scattered like clouds in all directions emitted roar, laughing aloud. Hearing the dreadful roar of Kumbhakarna, that resembled the rumbling of clouds, many Vanaras fell on the ground like severed Sala trees. Armed with a huge iron bar, Kumbhakarna stood for destroying the enemies like the great time spirit, deadly God of Death waits at the end of the universe along with Kinkaras, like a king.    This is the end of the sixty fifth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic, the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Mighty Kumbhakarna, a gigantic one, resembling a mountain peak, having swiftly crossed over the boundary of the city roared. Kumbhakarna roared making loud noises as if proclaiming victory, like the breaking of mountains and reverberating of ocean. Observing that rakshasa with frightening eyes, who could not be killed by Indra or Yama or even by Varuna coming towards them the vanaras ran in fear. Seeing the Vanaras running in fear, Angada spoke to Nala, Nila, Gavaksha, Mahabala and Kumuda. \"Forgetting yourself, that you are warriors, not knowing by nature, being Vanaras where are you going?\" \"O good Vanaras! You are modest. Return. Why are you protecting your life? This Rakshasa is not capable of facing war. He can create only fear.\" \"O Vanaras! We will dispel this huge rakshasa, a nightmare with our power. Come back.\" Overcoming fear, the Vanaras getting together from here and there holding trees by hand, proceeded to the battlefield. Those forest rangers who were extremely enraged turned back to hit, determined like the elephants in rut went to vanquish Kumbhakarna. Though Kumbhakarna was hit with lofty mountain peaks and trees with blossoms at crests, he was not shaken. Fallen on his limbs many rocks got broken, even the treetops with blossoms were broken and fell on the ground. Enraged Kumbhakarna began to destroy Vanaras endowed with extraordinary vigour, just as great forest fire burns the forest. Many bulls among the Vanaras lay on the ground like trees with red flowers on top tossed and fallen on the ground. The Vanaras leapt without looking back. Indeed, some dropped into the ocean, and some flew into space. Struck by Rakshasa, the Vanaras ran in the same path crossing the ocean (by which they came). Out of fear the vanaras rushed to plains with pale countenance, some climbed up mountains and bears climbed up trees. Some drowned in the ocean, some entered into the caves, some others not knowing what to do sat down and others fell on the ground and some slept as if dead. Seeing the monkeys routed, Angada spoke, 'Stay, return back. We will fight' \"I do not see any refuge for you even if you go round the globe. All of you return back. Why do you preserve life?\" \"Monkeys! Your valour can't be challenged. If you run away for life abandoning weapons even your wives will ridicule you. That is more than death.\" \"You are born in noble families, and are widely spread. As such why are you running away like ordinary monkeys as if terrified giving up your valour. It is not worthy of you.\" \"You are born in noble families, and are widely spread. As such why are you running away like ordinary monkeys as if terrified giving up your valour. It is not worthy of you.\" \"Earlier in the assembly of people you made vigorous statements and acclaimed yourselves highly with selfpraise. Where has it gone?\" \"He who is defeated lives, but people will say he is timid. Resorting to the path of good people and serving them gives up fear.\" \"If we are killed in war, fallen dead on the ground and our life span is reduced, we will attain the realm of Brahma which is difficult to attain.\" \"By killing the enemy, we will attain fame. Or else we will attain the world of Brahma, liberated.\" \"Just as flies reaching the blazing fire can't escape, so also Kumbhakarna can't escape with life after facing Kakuthsa.\" \"Even though we are distinguished, if we preserve our life by running away for life, destroyed by one, our glory will come to an end.\" While the heroic Angada, adorned with gold armlets, was speaking in that manner to the fleeing vanara heroes, condemned by the hero the vanaras replied as follows. \"Kumbhakarna, the Rakshasa has done havoc to us. This is not the moment to stay. Our life is dear to us.\" All the Vanara troops having replied that way, seeing Kumbhakarna of frightful eyes coming towards them, scattered in all directions. Though the heroic monkeys were running away, Angada by his good words and examples turned them to return from wherever they were. All the Vanara troops having heard Angada, son of Vali happily restored awaiting his command. Rshaba, Sarabha, Mainda and Nila, Kumuda, Susena, Rambha, and Tara headed by Dwiviida, Panasa and Hanuman marched ahead swiftly to the battlefield.    This is the end of the sixty sixth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic, the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard Angada's words, the Vanaras of gigantic body firmly decided to wage war and returned back. The Vanara leaders, having been reminded of their valour in battle by Angada gladly returned with a resolve to stake their life and carried on the battle. The Vanara leaders, having been reminded of their valour in battle by Angada gladly returned with a resolve to stake their life and carried on the battle. Thereafter the Vanaras of huge body wielding huge trees and mountain peaks quickly rushed towards Kumbhakarna. Valiant Kumbhakarna, a gigantic one, highly enraged lifted mace and crescent shaped arrow struck the enemies on all sides. Kumbhakarna held seven or eight or even hundred, thousand vanaras and threw them on the ground like serpents thrown by Garuda. Kumbhakarna became extremely angry, and caught hold of sixteen, eight, ten vanaras in the same way ninetynine and thirty and many more Vanaras and devoured them and went about like Garuda after having eaten the serpents. The Vanaras collected from here and there, having restored confidence in themselves with great difficulty, held trees and mountains and stood in the forefront of the battle. Thereafter Dwivida, a bull among the Vanaras lifted a mountain and went towards Kumbhakarna who resembled a threatening cloud. Vanara (Dwivida) going near Kumbhakarna struck him with the mountain. He missed the target and it fell on his army. The huge mountain peak crushed the horses, elephants and chariots and Rakshasa charioteers also. The battlefield on which the Rakshasas and horses were crushed, charioteers were killed by the speed of the mountain remained wet with blood. The Rakshasa charioteers severed the roaring Vanara leaders forcibly with their arrows emitting frightening sounds. They were like the Lord of Death at universal dissolution. Great monkeys, uprooting huge trees, began to destroy chariots, horses, camels, and Rakshasas. Stationed in the sky Hanuman rained mountain peaks, rocks, and huge trees of several kinds on the head of Kumbhakarna. Mighty Kumbhakarna split off the rocks, mountain peaks and the trees breaking them. Thereafter Kumbhakarna holding a sharp pike rushed towards Hanuman who uprooted a mountain peak and obstructed him placing it before him. Enraged Hanuman struck Kumbhakarna endowed with a rock like frightening body. Overpowered by that blow Kumbhakarna was upset and bespattered with fat and got bathed in blood. Kumbhakarna ,who was like a mountain blazing like fire, pierced at Maruti's chest with his pike shining like lightning just as Guha struck at Krauncha mountain. The great son of windgod, pierced with pike in the chest, ejected blood from his mouth, and roared in a frightening manner which was like thunder rumbling at the time of dissolution of the universe. Rakshasa's army collected together rejoiced to see Hanuman agonized. Vanaras were frightened and fled in fear of Kumbhakarna. The mighty and wise Neela flung a peak of a mountain on Kumbhakarna and restored the confidence of the army. (Kumbhakarna) observing the mountain peak coming towards him pierced it with his fist. Struck by the fist, the peak broke and sparks of fire came out shining brightly and fell on the ground. Rshaba, Sarabha, Neela, Gavaksha and Gandhamadana, these five tigers among Vanaras attacked Kumbhakarna. Those Vanaras of exceptional strength attacked gigantic Kumbhakarna on all sides by rocks, trees and by their fists, hands and feet also. Their attacks were like soft touches to Kumbhakarna, and no pain was experienced by him, and he encircled Rshaba by the shoulders with great impetuosity. Rshaba, the bull among Vanaras, of frightful appearance pressed by Kumbhakarna's shoulders, started bleeding from his teeth and fell down. Angry Kumbhakarna (enemy of Indra) hit Sarabha with his fist, Neela with his knees hurt Gavaksha and slapped him with his palms. Gandhamadana was kicked with force. Angry Kumbhakarna (enemy of Indra) hit Sarabha with his fist, Neela with his knees hurt Gavaksha and slapped him with his palms. Gandhamadana was kicked with force. Hurt by the blows of Kumbhakarna, their eyes bathed in blood, the Vanaras fainted and fell on the ground like cut down Kimsuka trees. Being great leaders and the important among them fallen, the Vanaras went in thousands towards Kumbhakarna. The bulls among Vanaras themselves looking like mountains endowed with great strength climbed up Kumbhakarna and bit him. The bulls among Vanaras hurt Kumbhakarna, endowed with strong shoulders, by scratching with nails, biting with teeth and hitting him with arms and fists. The tiger among Rakshasas covered with thousands of Rakshasas was resembling a mountain with trees grown on itself. Holding the Vanaras, the mighty Kumbhakarna started devouring all Vanaras just as Garuda does with serpents. As Kumbhakarna thrust Vanaras into his mouth, the Vanaras came out through his nostrils and also through his ears. The foremost of the Rakshasas, who resembled a mountain became enraged and mutilated the Vanaras. That terrible Rakshasa swooning and wetting the ground with flesh and blood ranged through the army of Vanaras like fire at the time of dissolution of the universe. Holding pike in hand, mighty Kumbhakarna was shining in the battlefield like Indra holding thunderbolt, and like Lord of Death holding the noose. Just as fire god consumes dried forest in summer, Kumbhakarna was consuming the Vanara army. Then with the army killed, the Vanaras moved without any leader making unnatural sounds out of fear and anger. Destroyed by Kumbhakarna in many ways, the Vanaras were heartbroken and sought the refuge of Raghava. The son of Vali who sprung from Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt seeing the Vanaras routed, rushed towards Kumbhakarna to assault. Angada taking a huge peak of a mountain roaring again and again following Kumbhakarna frightening the Rakshasas flung the mountain top on the forehead of Kumbhakarna and crushed him. Hit on the forehead by Angada, Kumbhakarna, burning with fury rushed. The intolerant Rakshasa then rushed to Vali's son with force. Hit on the forehead by Angada, Kumbhakarna, burning with fury rushed. The intolerant Rakshasa then rushed to Vali's son with force. Mighty Kumbhakarna agitated, making loud noise and frightening all the Vanaras hurled his pike on Angada. Angada who was knowledgeable of warfare, endowed with prowess, a bull among Vanaras, stopped the pike approaching him with agility and escaped. Jumping up that way, Angada slapped him with his palm on the chest in anger. By that the mountain like Kumbhakarna became unconscious. The mighty Rakshasa regained his consciousness and, doubling his fist hit Angada with the back of his hand and Angada fell, lost senses. When the tiger among the monkeys fell unconscious on ground, Kumbhakarna rushed towards Sugriva taking out the pike. Valiant Sugriva, seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna coming towards him jumped (in excitement). Sugriva, of great prowess lifting a mountain peak, whirled it round and round and darted towards Kumbhakarna swiftly. Kumbhakarna, looking at the monkey Lord advancing towards him, stood in front of all limbs braced. Sugriva spoke these words seeing Kumbhakarna who stood smeared with the blood of Vanaras and eating monkeys. Sugriva spoke these words seeing Kumbhakarna who stood smeared with the blood of Vanaras and eating monkeys. \"Give up with Vanaras, who are monkeys by nature. Bear this one mountain's blow of mine.\" Hearing the king of Vanara's words of courage and strength, the tiger among Rakshasas, Kumbhakarna spoke these words. \"O Vanara! You are the grandson of creator Brahma and son of Rksharaja, endowed with fortitude and so roaring like this.\" On hearing Kumbhakarna's words, Sugriva forcibly discharged a mountain resembling a thunderbolt on the chest of Kumbhakarna. Then the mountain peak dropped on the chest broke into pieces. Thereafter the monkeys were despaired, and Rakshasas roared in joy. Struck with mountain peaks, the Rakshasa became furious, and his pride was hurt. He opened his mouth widely making loud noises, his pike glowing like lightning, turned the pike into circles and hurled at Sugriva to put an end to him. Hanuman the son of windgod instantly seized Kumbhakarna with his arms, whose shaft was covered by chains and broke with both hands quickly. Then a rejoiced monkey, resting the thousand bharas iron pike on his knee broke it. Seeing the pike broken by Hanuman, the army of Vanaras rejoiced and roared repeatedly all over and rushed. Rakshasa was dismayed and mellowed. The forest rangers rejoiced and roared like lions going round. Seeing the broken pike Vanaras applauded Hanuman. That great soul, the Lord of Rakshasas seeing the pike broken in that way, was highly enraged. Taking Malaya Mountain from Lanka, he struck Sugriva who was approaching him. Struck by the piece of mountain the Vanara king became unconscious and dropped on the battlefield. Seeing that the Rakshasas were happy and naturally roared with a feeling of triumph. Kumbhakarna approaching the Vanara Lord Sugriva endowed with wonderful and dreadful prowess, went like wind carrying clouds taking him. In the battlefield, the form of Kumbhakarna which resembled a huge cloud was distinguished in appearance like the lofty peak of mountain Meru. Thereafter the heroic Rakshasa king having held Sugriva in the battle went, duly praised (by Rakshasas), hearing the roaring sounds of gods in heaven wondering at Sugriva's capture. Then Kumbhakarna, an enemy of Indra, who was equal to Indra in heroism seizing Sugriva, the Indra of monkeys, who is equal to Indra, thought, 'If Sugriva is killed it is like killing all the army including Rama.' Seeing the army running away here and there and Sugriva being captured by Kumbhakarna, wise Hanuman, the son of Maruti started thinking. 'Sugriva has been caught. What is my duty now? I will do what is just. I will destroy that Rakshasa who is in the form of a mountain', thought Maruti. 'Sugriva has been caught. What is my duty now? I will do what is just. I will destroy that Rakshasa who is in the form of a mountain', thought Maruti. 'Mighty Kumbhakarna shattered by my fist in a duel, and the king of Vanaras delivered, all the monkeys will be rejoiced.' 'Or else this Sugriva alone can get liberated by fighting by himself with gods, demons and Nagas also, even if he is captured'. \"I think that Sugriva, hit by Kumbhakarna with a mountain, has lost senses and is not able to know.\" Sugriva will soon regain consciousness and do what is good for Vanaras. \"If Sugriva is released by me, he will not be happy forever. His fame will be lost.\" \"Therefore, I will see the exhibition of his prowess for a while. Thereafter I shall reinforce the scattered army of Vanaras.\" Hanuman, the son of Maruti thinking in this way said to the Vanara army and brought determination. Then Kumbhakarna taking the great Vanara who started to shake by then, entered Lanka through the roads of lofty mansions from where Rakshasas hailed showering flowers. Exceptionally strong Sugriva with parched grain and fragrant water showered on him in the royal path, being cool, regained consciousness. (Sugriva) being strong and painfully gained senses, from the arms of the great Rakshasa, started looking at the royal path of the city. He was bewildered and started pondering this way. 'Caught in this way, how can I do (take action)? I will do what is possible, pleasing, and good to Vanaras now.' There after the king of Vanaras decided to act and tore off the ears of the enemy ruler of gods (Kumbhakarna) with his sharp nails, bit off the nose with his teeth, and sides of Kumbhakarna. Deprived of ears and nose by Sugriva, splitting with nails and teeth, Kumbhakarna was highly furious and pinning down Sugriva pounded him against the ground, limbs bespattered. Dropped on the ground by Kumbhakarna of dreadful strength, pressed against the ground surface, Sugriva bounced to the sky to get reunited with Rama. Great hero Kumbhakarna, devoid of ears and nose drenched in blood shone like a mountain in springs. Kumbhakarna of terrific valour and gigantic body, drenched in blood, dark in colour like a mountain of collyrium, resembling evening cloud, the night ranger went towards the battlefield. Kumbhakarna of terrific valour and gigantic body, drenched in blood, dark in colour like a mountain of collyrium, resembling evening cloud, the night ranger went towards the battlefield. Himself (Sugriva) gone, the enemy of the Lord of gods rushed again retreating, \"I am ferocious, without weapon.\" Then seizing an iron mallet, Sugriva went reflecting. The great Kumbhakarna then departing instantly entered into Vanara army consumed them as fire at dissolution consumed people. Kumbhakarna started seizing principal monkeys in the same way as death at the end of universe. Being famished for flesh and blood he entered the Vanara army in delusion and consumed not only Vanaras but Rakshasas, demons and bears also. Taking one, two, three, and many Vanaras along with Rakshasas hastily with one hand he was gulping them. Then the mighty Kumbhakarna while being struck by peaks of mountains, he was feasting on Vanaras fat and blood oozing out from his mouth. Being devoured by Kumbhakarna, the Vanaras went for refuge to Rama. Enraged Kumbhakarna followed the Vanaras behind. Stretching his arms on all sides picking hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred and two hundred and three hundred, he ran devouring the vanaras. His limbs smeared with fat and blood, with wreaths of entrails hanging on his ears, with sharp teeth, grown in his body to huge size, rained darts like the spirit of death at the end of the world. At that time, Sumitra's son, Lakshmana, winner of enemy forces, conqueror of forts, enraged went to fight. Valiant Lakshmana pierced seven arrows on Kumbhakarna's body and discharged many arrows on him. Kumbhakarna having been tormented, put an end to the dart (of Lakshmana). Mighty Lakshmana there upon flew into a rage. Then he covered Kumbhakarna's glittering golden shield with arrows just as the evening wind covered the cloud. Adorned with golden ornaments (Kumbhakarna), covered with darts without being tormented he looked like a dark mountain shining like sun rays covered by clouds. Thereupon the Rakshasa sounding like the rumblings of clouds disdainfully spoke these words to Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra. \"You have exhibited your valour without fear in battle, challenging me who has conquered even Lord of Death without difficulty in battle.\" \"He who is ready to face me, a rival of Lord of Death in conflict, with weapons in hand in great battle is worthy of honour to me.\" \"Indra mounted on the elephant, Airavata surrounded by all Devatas, indeed never stood before me in conflict.\" \"Now I am gratified with your valour, though young. Taking leave of you, I wish to go to Raghava.\" \"I am gratified by your valour, strength and enthusiasm which has been exhibited by you in the battle. However, I wish to kill Rama alone.\" \"When Rama has been put to an end by me in conflict, whoever remains can be struck down by my army.\" When that Rakshasa made such boastful and dreadful statements in the battlefield, laughing heartily, Saumitri replied as follows. \"O Hero! that heroism you have acquired is irresistible even by Indra is true. Now your prowess has been witnessed. Rama stands here, immovable like a mountain.\" Kumbhakarna of mighty strength, the night ranger hearing Lakshmana, rather disregarding his words, overlooking him went alone towards Rama as if shaking the earth. Kumbhakarna of mighty strength, the night ranger hearing Lakshmana, rather disregarding his words, overlooking him went alone towards Rama as if shaking the earth. Sri Rama, son of Dasaratha, now released a sharp arrow presided over by Rudra and fixed into the chest of Kumbhakarna. As Rama hit in anger, at once fire mixed with flames shot forth from Kumbhakarna's mouth. Pierced by Rama's missiles, the foremost of the Rakshasas, Kumbhakarna was very angry and rushed towards him dispersing all the vanaras in the battle. Adorned by peacock's plumes, those arrows slipped into his breast, he lost senses, his mace naturally dropped down from his hand. All his weapons scattered on the ground, the mighty Kumbhakarna deprived of weapons thought for himself and created havoc with his feet and fists. Pierced by arrows excessively all over his limbs, bathing in blood flowing from the injury was like a mountain with a spring. Kumbhakarna in violent anger, blood flowing from the injury, went about devouring Vanaras, Rakshasas and bears. Thereupon, Kumbhakarna endowed with terrific valour like God of Death hurled towards Rama a mountain peak whirling it round which split. Rama once again taking the bow, split the peak of the mountain with seven unfailing arrows on its way even before it reached the target. The righteous Rama, a bull among men, taking his arrows adorned with gold split the peak of the mountain. While falling down, Kumbhakarna was like Mount Meru, shining by his splendour was falling down and knocking down two hundred monkeys. At that time, righteous Lakshmana who was attentively deliberating on many plans to kill Kumbhakarna, said to Rama. \"This king intoxicated with the smell of blood is not knowing his own people and foes and devouring both Vanaras and Rakshasas.\" Let the bulls among Vanaras climb upon him and the foremost of Vanaras and the troops stand all over. Distressed by heavy weight unable to get up evil minded Rakshasa fallen on the ground will not destroy monkeys. Having heard the words of the wise Prince, the monkeys collected climbed on Kumbhakarna happily. Enraged Kumbhakarna shook off the monkeys climbed on his body like a harsh elephant shakes off its rider. Seeing the Vanaras shaken, Rama went towards the Rakshasa instantly and took out his best bow. Raghava's eyes turned red with anger, went quickly in anger as monkeys and troop leaders oppressed by Kumbhakarna were rejoiced. Raghava's eyes turned red with anger, went quickly in anger as monkeys and troop leaders oppressed by Kumbhakarna were rejoiced. Rama, taking a formidable bow which resembled a great serpent, with a quiver full of excellent arrows shining in gold that looked beautiful, went forward restoring the confidence of the monkeys. Mighty Rama, who is extremely difficult to win over, went with full conviction followed by Lakshmana and surrounded by vanara troops. Great Rama, endowed with extraordinary might, saw Kumbhakarna, the tamer of enemies covered with blood and having red eyes. Surrounded by Rakshasas, he was searching for Vanaras, like an elephant, guarding a quarter, searches. (Kumbhakarna) Adorned with gold armlets, blood flowing from his mouth was like a rain cloud showering from Vindhya or Mandara mountain. With blood red eyes, licking the corner of his mouth with his tongue, crushing Vanara army, he looked like God of Death at dissolution. Seeing the foremost of Rakshasas, shining like fire, Rama, the bull among men stretched his bow. Enraged by the loud sound of the twang of the bow, the bull among Rakshasas unable to bear rushed towards Raghava. Thereafter Rama spoke to Kumbhakarna, whose hands were like Vasuki's body, coming towards him to attack on the battlefield like a cloud chased by wind. \"O king of Rakshasas! Come. Do not be despondent. I stand with my bow. In a moment I will destroy you. Look, the Rakshasa clan will be put to an end.\" Knowing that this is Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed in an unnatural manner making a sound and ran after scattering the monkeys in great rage. Highly energetic Kumbhakarna laughing in hideous ways making sounds like rumblings of clouds breaking the hearts of forest rangers spoke these words. \"I am not Viradha, not Vijeya, not Kabhanda, not also Vali or Maricha. I am Kumbhakarna and have come.\" \"See my terrible club made of wrought iron. By this I have won earlier Devatas and Danavas.\" \"Do not think I have been deprived of ears and nose and look with contempt. I do not have little pain.\" \"O Tiger of the Ikshvaku clan! Exhibit your manliness, prowess, and valour on me. I will eat you up later.\" On hearing Kumbhakarna's words Rama was bewildered. He discharged plumed arrows at a speed of thunderbolt. Struck by the arrows the enemy of Devatas was not shaken or agonized. Those arrows which had cut down the Sala trees and the Vanara leader, Vali, which were like thunderbolts, did not affect Kumbhakarna's body. The enemy of Lord Indra drank the arrows through his body and hurled his club at great speed whirling it round and round arrested the arrows of Rama. Then Kumbhakarna with his club covered with blood and frightening even the celestials scattered the monkeys. Thereupon taking up the weapon of Wind God, Rama discharged on the night ranger and severed his right arm with the mace. His arm torn off, Kumbhakarna made uproarious noise. Kumbhakarna's arm severed by Rama's arrow was like a mountain peak. It fell on Vanara army too and killed the monkey king's army. Then the remaining Vanaras who escaped killing and mutilation went close feeling desperate and witnessed the comb at between Rama and Kumbhakarna. One arm cut off, Kumbhakarna deprived of limb looked like a mountain with peak cut off. Thereafter he seized a palmyra tree and went towards Rama. Then Rama yoking his bow with an arrow charged with Indra's mantra and decked with gold severed Kumbhakarna's arm which was like coils of serpent and held the palmyra tree. Kumbhakarna who resembled a mountain, his arm severed turning round and round fell on trees, mountains, Vanaras and Rakshasas crushing them. Perceiving Kumbhakarna with broken arms rushing towards him, Rama at once took a sharp moon shaped arrow and split his feet. Both the feet falling on ground made a resounding noise that filled all over the four quarters, all directions, nay all mountains and caves of Trikuta and also Lanka. Arms broken, feet cut off, dilating his mouth like fire, shouting aloud like Rahu entering moon in the sky he rushed to Rama speedily. Rama filled the mouth of Kumbhakarna with his sharp and pointed gold encrusted arrows. Unable to speak the Rakshasa moaned and fainted. Then Rama took up the effulgent sun beam like arrow with feathers and the destructive rod of Brahma and the Time spirit that was fatal to enemies that was fast as wind speed and charged with Indra's mantra. Rama crushed the night ranger to pieces with his arrow encrusted with diamonds and gold, glowing like the Sun 's rays and fire which resembled Indra's thunderbolt, in speed. Discharged from Rama's arm, the terrific weapon went just as the Lord of god's weapon, which was like Indra's thunderbolt burning like fire, shining by its brilliance and went in all directions and cut the head of Vritasura. The arrow (of Rama) severed the head of Rakshasa king whose body was like a lofty mountain peak, whose teeth were large and protruded, hanging earrings shaking, just as Indra severed the head of Vritasura earlier. The huge head of Kumbhakarna adorned with earrings was like the moon rising between the stars in the heaven at night presided by Aditi, the mother of twin gods. Killed by Rama's arrow, that head of the Rakshasa, which was like a mountain had demolished the walls and houses and peaks of buildings. The shining huge body of Rakshasa fell into the ocean crushing the other beings in the ocean like alligators, fishes and serpents that entered into the earth. Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Brahmans and Devatas, having been killed, the Earth, all mountains, Devatas highly rejoiced. Thereafter the celestial sages and other sages, serpents, Devatas and all beings including eagles and Guhyakas (airborne animals), Yakshas and Gandharvas rejoiced very much at Rama's valour. Thereupon, the courageous kinsfolk of Ravana, resolute in mind, pained by the death of Kumbhakarna, feared the foremost of Raghus, just as elephants feared seeing the Lord of Devatas, and emitted loud cries. Having killed Kumbhakarna, in the combat, Rama shone brilliantly just as Sun liberated from Rahu's mouth, after dispersing the darkness of the abode of Devatas. Many Vanaras, with their faces resembling full blown lotuses joyfully laughed and worshipped Rama for getting rid of an enemy of terrific strength.",
                "Seeing Kumbhakarna slain by the glorious Raghava, the Rakshasas informed Ravana, the king of Rakshasas. \"O King! Kumbhakarna, who was equal to the God of Death, devoured and won over the Vanaras, scattered the army, has joined death as a consequence of time (fate).\" \"Your brother Kumbhakarna showed his might for a short time. But by virtue of Rama's energy and arrows, his mountainlike body was reduced to a trunk of dreadful appearance. Bleeding excessively, he was like a mass submerged in an ocean of blood. like a tree caught in forest fire he was blocking the gate of Lanka in ugly form with a head, nose and ears chopped off.\" \"Your brother Kumbhakarna showed his might for a short time. But by virtue of Rama's energy and arrows, his mountainlike body was reduced to a trunk of dreadful appearance. Bleeding excessively, he was like a mass submerged in an ocean of blood. like a tree caught in forest fire he was blocking the gate of Lanka in ugly form with a head, nose and ears chopped off.\" \"Your brother Kumbhakarna showed his might for a short time.

Bleeding excessively, he was like a mass submerged in an ocean of blood. like a tree caught in forest fire he was blocking the gate of Lanka in ugly form with a head, nose and ears chopped off.\" Hearing that Kumbhakarna of great strength was slain, Ravana immersed in grief became deluded and fell. Hearing about uncle's destruction, the sons of Ravana, Devanthaka, Naranthaka, Trisira and Atikaya, roared aloud afflicted by grief. Ravana's brothers, Mahodara and Mahaparsva were overtaken by sorrow on hearing about the unwearied action of Rama and slaying of Kumbhakarna. Thereafter the foremost of the Rakshasas regained consciousness with great difficulty and awakened to the situation of Kumbhakarna's destruction, wailed disturbed in mind. \"Ha! Hero! Kumbhakarna! You, who crushed the pride of the enemy, endowed with great prowess have deserted me and gone to the abode of death, actually by divine will.\" \"O Kumbhakarna of extraordinary might! You have tormented the enemy army singlehanded with valour. You are going alone leaving me and the kinsfolk.\" \"I who depended on you like my right arm did not fear Devatas or Danavas and I am destroyed now.\" \"You, who crushed the pride of Devas and Danavas are equal to timespirit and death at dissolution and being a hero, how did you die in the hands of Raghava?\" \"You are never affected by the strike of thunderbolt. How are you sleeping on the ground hit by Rama's arrows?\" \"These Devatas and all sages are standing in the sky, seeing the battle and laughing aloud seeing your destruction.\" \"Having found an opportunity, all the Vanaras, highly rejoiced, on this very day, will surely climb over the gates of forts of Lanka determined.\" \"I have no purpose with the kingdom. What will I do with Sita? I have lost my life and mind with Kumbhakarna's death.\" \"If I do not kill Raghava who killed my brother in battle it is a waste of my life.\" Thus, thought Ravana. \"This very day, this very minute I shall reach the region where my brother died, I have no interest in life.\" \"Devatas who were harmed by me earlier will laugh at me now that Kumbhakarna is slain. How will I win Indra?\" \"This calamity that has come upon me was because I have not taken such auspicious advice rendered by the great soul Vibheeshana.\" \"Thus, loss of both Kumbhakarna and Prahastha is dreadful. It is because of not following the words of advice of Vibheeshana totally. It hurts me.\" \"Righteous and prosperous Vibheeshana has been expelled by me earlier. By that action, I have obtained this grief.\"",
                "Hearing the lamentations of the evilminded Ravana, Trisira spoke to him. \"There is no doubt that Kumbhakarna, who is your middle father and uncle, was also endowed with great prowess. He has been killed. O King! Good men like you do not wail.\" \"O King! You are a conqueror of the three worlds. Why do you wail like a common man?\" \"You are bestowed by Brahma with a javelin, a shield and an arrow and a chariot yoked by a thousand donkeys making rumbling sounds like a cloud.\" \"Devas and Danavas have been won over by you, deprived of weapons also. Now endowed with all weapons you will be able to win Raghava.\" \"O King! Stay on. I will move forth to the battlefield and uproot your enemy like Garuda uprooted serpents.\" \"Just as Lord of Devas by Sambara, and Vishnu by Naraka, in the same way Rama will also be destroyed struck by me.\" Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, hearing Trisira's words thought that impelled by destiny that he was reborn. Hearing Trisira's words both Devanthaka and Naranthaka and glorious Atikaya became enthusiastic for combat. Then Ravana's sons, the heroes, and bulls among ogres, equal to Indra in valour, roared saying, \"I will start\", \"I will lead.\" All (sons of Ravana) are capable of coursing through the sky, experts in conjuring tricks, capable of crushing the pride of Devatas and all, are fierce in fighting. All sons of Ravana possessed stupendous strength, all were very famous, and never got defeated in war be it Gandharvas, Kinnaras or even gods will get vanquished by them. All were experts in the use of weapons, all were heroes and skilled in warfare, knowledgeable in scriptures, so also all were blessed with boons. Surrounded by his sons, who matched Sun in brilliance and capable of crushing the pride of foes, great in destroying immortals, Ravana shone like Lord gods. Ravana embraced his sons, decked them with ornaments and jewels and enriched them and offered benediction and sent to encounter. Ravana sent his two brothers Yuddhonmatta and Matta for the protection of his sons for defence in combat. Those heroes greeting gigantic Ravana, went around him clockwise (as per tradition) and departed. The six leaders endowed with great strength, anointing themselves with fragrance, which can ward off injury went to fight. Trisira, also Atikaya, Devanthaka, Naranthaka, Mahodara and Mahaparsva impelled by destiny went. Thereafter Mahodara mounted on an elephant born of Airavata (Indra 's elephant) family, by name Sudarsana went. Ready with all kinds of weapons, quivers as well mounted on elephants shone like the setting Sun in the west. Ravana's brother, Trisira went mounted on a chariot yoked to the best of horses with all kinds of weapons. Wielding a bow and sitting like a leader in the chariot Trisira shone as if attended by lightning, meteors, light, and rainbows. Trisira seated in the best of chariots, with his three heads adorned with crowns shone like the golden mountain, Himalayas with its three peaks. Then Atikaya the very bright son of Rakshasa king, foremost of all archers mounted on the best of chariots. The chariot (of Atikaya) had excellent wheels, well fitted with strong axles, stout poles, equipped with quivers and bows, with best of spears, bars, and swords. His wonderful coronet encrusted with gold was shining, sparkling, and looked splendid like the Meru Mountain. The tiger among ogres (Atikaya) surrounded by the great army of ogres, the prince was shining in the chariot like Indra, the king of gods and wielder of thunderbolt. Naranthaka, mounted on Uchaisrava, the white horse, decked in gold, was swift as thought in speed. Naranthaka seizing a barbed missile like a burning spear, looked like son of Lord Siva wielding javelin in hand. Devanthaka, holding a bar encrusted with diamonds in both hands, seemed like Vishnu in disguise with a mountain (to churn the milky ocean). Mahaparsva holding an ace in hand in the war shone like Kubera. Those great souls followed by elephants, horses, Rakshasas with superb weapons sounding like the rumbling of rainy clouds went like gods of Amaravati. The great princes were wearing crowns resplendent like the Sun and glowing like planets in the sky. The princes, grasping the white weapons shone like flocks of white cranes in the dark autumnal clouds in the sky. Those heroes determined to defeat the enemy even if it meant death and went thinking for the combat. The great Rakshasas who were fierce in combat went roaring shouting loudly and discharging arrows. By the sound of their clapping of arms and their lion roar it was as though the sky was breaking and the earth was shaking. Departing from there the Rakshasa army saw Vanara army ready with many rocks. The huge monkeys also saw groups of elephants, horses and chariots and heard hundreds of bells of the chariots and Rakshasas all over like groups of dark clouds with huge weapons glowing like fire and Sun surrounded by Rakshasa army. The huge monkeys also saw groups of elephants, horses and chariots and heard hundreds of bells of the chariots and Rakshasas all over like groups of dark clouds with huge weapons glowing like fire and Sun surrounded by Rakshasa army. Seeing the Rakshasa army approaching, the monkeys found an opportunity to attack them and collected huge mountains, deadly strong trees in great joy unable to tolerate roared in return. Seeing the Rakshasa army approaching, the monkeys found an opportunity to attack them and collected huge mountains, deadly strong trees in great joy unable to tolerate roared in return. There upon the Vanara leaders, endowed with extraordinary prowess, beholding the joy of Rakshasa troops, unable to bear roared dreadfully. Those monkey leaders entering dreadful Rakshasa army uplifted rocks and mountains with trees and shone. Some monkeys springing into the sky, while some staying on earth, with trees, rocks as weapons, enraged, ranged the Rakshasa army. Vanara leaders seizing huge branches of trees fought a frightening war with Rakshasas. The Vanaras of dreadful valour and unparalleled might waged with trees, rock and mountain when obstructed by the Rakshasas The Rakshasas and Vanaras enthusiastic in the battlefield roared like lion. The Vanaras pounded the Rakshasas with rocks. In the combat, the enraged Vanaras killed Rakshasas decked with shields and ornaments. Some killed the ones mounted on chariots, elephants, and horses. The Rakshasa leaders, hit by the blows of Vanaras, fell down on the mountain peaks, trembling with their eyes protruded by the blows of fists. The Rakshasas also pierced with arrows the foremost of the monkeys and struck with tridents swords and lances. Their limbs stained with the blood of foes, both Vanaras and Rakshasas eager to conquer one another started striking one another. Then in a short while the battlefield was covered with blood and rocks and swords used by the monkeys and Rakshasas. There, the battlefield was filled with mountain like forms of Rakshasas drunk with the pride of warfare, lying scattered all over. Vanaras, were lifting and dropping the scattered Rakshasas, breaking the tridents and a wonderful war went on using their limbs. The bull among Rakshasas struck at Vanaras with other Vanaras and the monkeys struck Rakshasas with other Rakshasas. The monkeys struck at the Rakshasas taking the weapons left over and tearing the weapons of the Rakshasas and the Vanaras also struck the Rakshasas. In the battlefield both Vanaras and Rakshasas struck at one another with their head, rocks and swords and emitted lion roar. The Rakshasas killed by Vanaras, their shields and weapons broken, blood flowed from their limbs just as sap exudes from broken trees. In the battlefield a chariot with another chariot, an elephant with another elephant, a horse with another horse struck one another. Rakshasas shattered the Vanara leaders with horseshoe shaped, halfmoon shaped, spear shaped sharp arrows, as well as trees and rocks. The battlefield, covered with broken trees and mountains, fallen vanaras and rakshasas, seemed difficult to tread on ground. Those Vanaras leaving behind fear, reaching the war field, rejoicing with pride, not at all depressed, carried out war with Rakshasas. As the conflict progressed and tumultuous fighting was on, Vanaras were feeling exultant and seeing Rakshasas struck down the ascetics and Devatas made loud noises in joy. Then Naranthaka, mounted on horseback went at wind speed taking hold of javelin and entered Vanara army just as fish entered the ocean. Great hero (Naranthaka) single handed persistently destroyed seven hundred Vanaras with his glowing spear. In that way the enemy of Indra shattered Vanara army and monkey leaders. Vidhyadhara, the great sage, witnessed Naranthaka moving seated on the horseback firmly. On the way he saw flesh and blood fallen like a heap of a mountain covered fully with Vanaras. Naranthaka went past the Vanara leaders all over even before they attempted, he destroyed them. Uplifting his lance in the battle, Naranthaka consumed the Vanara troops as fire would burn up forests even before the Vanaras uprooted trees and rocks. many Vanaras fell like mountains hit by a thunderbolt. Mighty Naranthaka, the destroyer of humans, ranged over all sides in all directions in the battlefield, like the wind in the rainy season, taking a burning spear and crushing everything. Mighty Naranthaka, the destroyer of humans, ranged over all sides in all directions in the battlefield, like the wind in the rainy season, taking a burning spear and crushing everything. The gallant monkeys got terrified and could not flee, nor stand, nor move. The audacious Naranthaka marching ahead pierced the Vanaras either marching or jumping or stationary. With lance that looked like death and the spear glowing like the Sun, Naranthaka routed the Vanaras, who fell down. Unable to bear the very severe impact of the strike of the spear which was like the strike of thunderbolt the Vanaras cried making loud noise. The forms of the monkey heroes fallen down unconscious shone like mountain peaks struck by the thunderbolt and fallen. The Vanaras who were struck by Kumbhakarna and fallen unconscious, came and stood before Sugriva. Sugriva looked around all over the monkey troops running here and there out of fear of Naranthaka. (Sugriva) saw the Vanaras troops running and Naranthaka seated on horseback advancing with a spear. Sugriva, the Lord of Vanaras seeing (Naranthaka advancing) spoke to his son Angada who resembled Indra in valour. \"Oh! March ahead and immediately release the life of the Rakshasa seated on horseback terrifying the Vanara army.\" On hearing the king's words, Angada went just as the sun rays comes out of a cluster of clouds. Angada, the best of the Vanaras, adorned with arm lets resembled masses of rocks and shone like a mountain with metal streaks. Brilliant Angada, unarmed only with nails and teeth (to fight) advanced towards Naranthaka and spoke these words. \"Stop! What can you do with these common monkeys? Throw your spear at me, which equals thunderbolt.\" Hearing Angada's words Naranthaka flew into a rage. Biting his lips with teeth, hissing like a serpent Naranthaka stood before Angada. He hurled his spear glowing like fire on Angada's chest violently. It struck Angada and shattered, went round, and fell. Hearing Angada's words Naranthaka flew into a rage. Biting his lips with teeth, hissing like a serpent Naranthaka stood before Angada. He hurled his spear glowing like fire on Angada's chest violently. It struck Angada and shattered, went round, and fell. Then Vali's son beholding the broken and shattered spear fallen like the coils of serpent, raised his palm and struck at the head of Naranthaka's horse. His horse, which closely resembled a mountain, fell on the ground, its head broken, cheeks drawn in, eyeballs broken, tongue got ejected by the stroke of the palm of Angada. Observing the horse fallen, Naranthaka, endowed with great power, overcome by anger raised his fist and struck at the head of Vali's son. Angada's head smashed by the blow of the fist of Naranthaka, hot blood flowed rapidly for a while. Recovering from delusion, gaining consciousness he wondered at the strength of Naranthaka. Angada clenching his fist, whose vehemence was equal to vehemence of death coming down from the top of the mountain peak, brought down Naranthaka. Naranthaka's chest having been split by a blow on his chest, vomiting flaming blood from his throat was as if shattered by the stroke of lightning fell down like a mountain. Naranthaka, the foremost of the heroes, having been killed in combat, the Devatas and gods of the three worlds experienced great joy.",
                "Seeing the bulls among Rakshasas Naranthaka, Devanthaka, Trisira and Mahodara a scion of Paulastya and Mahodara, killed the Rakshasas cried aloud. Mahodara who closely resembled a cloud, mounted on the best of elephants chased brave and courageous son of Vali. Then, powerful Devanthaka who was immersed in grief of his brother, taking hold of a glowing iron bar rushed forward towards Angada. Then Trisira, seated on the chariot, effulgent as the Sun, yoked to the best horse marched towards Angada. Angada observed that all the three chiefs of Rakshasas, who were capable of crushing the pride of gods marching towards him and uprooted a huge tree. Just as Indra took a flaming thunderbolt, Angada, the hero took hold of huge branches of trees and hurled at Devanthaka with force. Trisira split the trees with the arrows which were like venomous serpents. Observing Angada's action he flew up. Then the leader of the monkeys, rained trees and rocks. Angry Trisira attacked all of them with sharp arrows. Mahodara shattered those trees with the iron clubs. Trisira attacked brave Angada with arrows. Mahodara chased the elephant on to Angada in anger and attacked him on his chest with his iron clubs. Then infuriated Devanthaka quickly came over Angada directly and attacked him with his iron club and retreated. Eminent and highly energetic son of Vali did not feel perturbed when three of the foremost Rakshasas attacked him together. Angada, who was endowed with high speed, and exceedingly difficult to encounter, jumped up the huge elephant of Mahodara attacked him. By that blow of Angada, that king of elephant's eyes dropped, and it cried. Mighty son of Vali removed the tusk of the elephant and hit Devanthaka with it by jumping over him in the battlefield. That astonishing Rakshasa shaken like a tree, thrown by the wind, shed huge amounts of blood which was of the colour of lacquer. Thereafter the terribly strong Devanthaka taking iron spike quickly pierced Angada. Then, hurt by the club the son of Vanara king fell down on his knees once again and got up. While Angada was getting up, Trisira again hit him on the forehead with three straight going arrows. Then finding Angada surrounded by the three Rakshasa leaders, Hanuman as well as Neela set out. Thereafter Neela hit Trisira with the peak of the mountain and Ravana's son broke the mountain into pieces with arrows. Hit by hundreds of arrows, the mountain peak broke into pieces of stones like sparks and flames fell from it. Mighty Devanthaka, observing (Trisira's action), was happy on the battlefield, and went with his club to assault Hanuman. Then the son of wind god, Hanuman observing Devanthaka coming towards him, got up and hit him on the forehead with his thunderbolt like fist. When the heroic and strong son of the wind god hit on the head of Devanthaka, the Rakshasas trembled by the sound of the great monkey 's blow. Devanthaka's skull was shattered by the blow, and his teeth, eyes and tongue were forced out, the son of Rakshasa king fell dead on the ground. Devanthaka, the foremost of Rakshasa warriors, an enemy of gods, endowed with great strength, having been killed in the conflict, Trisira became angry and rained arrows on Neela's chest. Mahodara got enraged, mounted on an elephant just as the Sun went over Mandara mountain and went for war. Then Mahodara wielding bow rained arrows, just as rainy clouds with lightning and rainbows showers rain, on the mountain like chest of Neela. Mahodara got enraged, mounted on an elephant just as the Sun went over Mandara mountain and went for war. Then Mahodara wielding bow rained arrows, just as rainy clouds with lightning and rainbows showers rain, on the mountain like chest of Neela. Neela's body wetted by arrows all over, the limbs pierced with arrows, the monkey leader remained powerless and could not move in spite of being extraordinarily strong. Thereafter Neela also regained his senses and uprooting a mountain filled with trees went over Mahodara at high speed and attacked him on the forehead. Then smashed by the impact of the mountain, along with his elephant Mahodara's body fell to the ground. Released from life, he fell like a mountain struck with lightning. Trisira got enraged seeing his uncle killed, seized his bow and with a sharp arrow pierced Hanuman. The son of the wind god in anger hurled a top of the mountain on mighty Trisira, who split the mountain into several pieces with an arrow. Then seeing that the top of the mountain hurled was ineffective in that battle over Ravana's son, Hanuman discharged rain of trees. Stupendous Trisira tore with his whetted arrows the rain of trees through the sky and roared. Then Hanuman also jumped up in anger and tore the horse off Trisira just as the lion would tear the lordly elephant with nails. In the same manner, Trisira, the son of Ravana sprung up and seized a javelin, just as God of death in dark night and hurled at the son of wind god and shattered. Hanuman, the best of monkeys, snapped the javelin flung by Trisira on him, which came down unobstructed like a meteor from heaven and the monkeys roared. Seeing the dreadful form of shattered javelin, all Vanaras rejoiced and thundered like rain clouds. Trisira, the foremost of Rakshasas then lifted his sword, placed it on the chest of Hanuman and dug into it. Heroic Hanuman hit by Trisira, attacked him with his palm on the chest. Trisira, a highly energetic one, hit by Hanuman with his palm, dropped the weapon from his hand, lost his senses and fell on the ground. Taking the sword from Trisira, as he was falling, the great Vanara who resembled a mountain roared, creating terror in all, surrounded there. Unable to bear that roar, that Rakshasa got up jumping and struck Hanuman with his fist. The great monkey hit by the fist (of Trisira) became furious and in anger he got hold of Trisira's head with crown. Enraged wind god's son, cut off the three heads of Trisira adorned with earrings just as Indra cut off the heads of Vishwarupa, son of Twashta. The heads of Trisira, an enemy of Indra, resembling mountains with incongruous eyes glowing like Vyshvanara's eyes, fell into wilderness like stars fallen from the path of Sun. Trisira, the enemy of gods, endowed with the prowess of Indra got killed by Hanuman. The earth shook, the monkeys roared and the Rakshasas from all sides took to their heels. Witnessing Trisira killed, earlier Mahodara also, Devanthaka and Naranthaka who are difficult to encounter killed, monkeys roared in joy seeing that Matta became very angry. Mahaparsva seized hold of a good venerable, allpowerful mace plated with gold, smeared with flesh and blood, shining with lustre, shining red with enemy's blood, an effulgent one whose head has been glowing decorated with red flower garlands that brought terror to Airavatam, Mahapadma, and Sarvabhuama, the three elephants guarding the three of the four quarters. Mahaparsva seized hold of a good venerable, allpowerful mace plated with gold, smeared with flesh and blood, shining with lustre, shining red with enemy's blood, an effulgent one whose head has been glowing decorated with red flower garlands that brought terror to Airavatam, Mahapadma, and Sarvabhuama, the three elephants guarding the three of the four quarters. Mahaparsva seized hold of a good venerable, allpowerful mace plated with gold, smeared with flesh and blood, shining with lustre, shining red with enemy's blood, an effulgent one whose head has been glowing decorated with red flower garlands that brought terror to Airavatam, Mahapadma, and Sarvabhuama, the three elephants guarding the three of the four quarters. Matta, the Rakshasa leader became very furious and took hold of the mace glowing like fire, at the time of dissolution of the universe and scattered the monkeys. Rshaba, the bull among Vanaras endowed with prowess, springing up came and stood in front of Mahaparsva. Again, seeing Rshaba standing in front like a mountain, enraged Mahaparsva hit him on the chest with the mace that was like a thunderbolt. Hit in that way by the mace, Rshaba, bull of Vanaras, with chest broken, blood flowed excessively. Regaining consciousness after a long time the monkey chief, Rshaba, was angry, his lips quivering as he was, ran to Mahaparsva. The chief of the Vanaras, whose form was like a mountain, endowed with speed, got up quickly, duly, and forcibly hit the Rakshasa (Mahaparsva) in the space between his arms. Like a tree whose roots have been severed, the Rakshasa fell on the ground. Then seizing forcibly, the dreadful mace that resembled the rod of Lord of death he roared. For a short while, Mahaparsva, the enemy of gods remained as if life had gone off up and struck the son of waters (Rshaba). The monkey was unconscious for a while having fallen on the ground. Regaining senses, overcoming, took up the mace which looked like the rock of a foremost mountain and struck him (Mahaparsva) on the battlefield. He (Rshaba) reached the body of the ferocious enemy of gods and brahmins. He split his chest with his mace and the timid Rakshasa shed blood just as Himalaya Mountain discharges water. The great Rakshasa Mahaparsva went towards the mace held by Rshaba, the great soul. Taking hold of the mace, Rshaba struck the Rakshasa again and again and pierced him in the forefront of the battlefield. Shattered by his own mace, Matta (Mahaparsva), whose eyes had been crushed, had fallen like a mountain struck by lightning. Strength gone, life ceased, eyes crushed, his own Rakshasas fallen on the ground, the Rakshasa army fled.",
                "Highly energetic Atikaya, who was like a mountain in form, had huge body, obtained boons from Brahma, subdued the pride of Devas and Danavas, was equal to Indra in valour. Seeing his own army of Rakshasas that caused horripilation, uncles who were bulls among Rakshasas struck down in the battlefield and his own brothers Yuddhotama (Mahodara) and Matta (Mahaparsva) struck down, he flew in rage.

Seeing his own army of Rakshasas that caused horripilation, uncles who were bulls among Rakshasas struck down in the battlefield and his own brothers Yuddhotama (Mahodara) and Matta (Mahaparsva) struck down, he flew in rage. Adorned with a crown, Ravana glowing like a thousand suns collected together mounted the chariot and darted towards Vanaras. Adorned with crown, and polished earrings, twanging his bow, proclaimed his name and roared sounding aloud. By that lionroar, and proclamation of his name (by the sound of the twang) frightening the Vanaras he struck terror. Those Vanaras seeing the huge body thought, \"This is Kumbhakarna, who has got up and come'. Out of fear, they sought the help of one another. The Vanara troops, observing his form resembling the Trivikram form assumed by Vishnu, the monkey troops fled here and there in panic. The Vanaras were deluded on reaching the huge body and went to Sri Rama to seek refuge. Then Kakutstha saw from a distance form of huge body looking like a mountain, wielding bow, rumbling like a cloud at universal destruction. Raghava the great, seeing the form of a huge body, was amazed, reassured by the Vanaras, and spoke to Vibheeshana. \"Who is he, the yelloweyed, resembling a mountain, seated in the broad chariot drawn by a thousand horses?\" \"Who is he in the midst, with sharp tridents and shining spears, like Maheswara surrounded by beings?\" \"Who is he, gleaming like the tongues of time spirit (Kala spirit), with flashes of javelins, encircled with lightning and looking like a cloud shining very bright?\" \"His bows decorated with gold on the back, are like a rainbow in the sky on all sides and makes the chariot excellent.\" \"The tiger among the Rakshasas seated in the chariot is the foremost car warrior. He is illuminating the battlefield like the brightness of the Sun, resplendent like Sun 's rays. By his arrows he is illuminating the ten directions. The Rahu emblem on top of the pole of the chariot is very splendid.\" \"The tiger among the Rakshasas seated in the chariot is the foremost car warrior. He is illuminating the battlefield like the brightness of the Sun, resplendent like Sun 's rays. By his arrows he is illuminating the ten directions. The Rahu emblem on top of the pole of the chariot is very splendid.\" \"His bow with three curves, covered with gold, decorated, is close to a thundering cloud, casting its splendour.\" \"His chariot with standard, flag and axletree is a great one driven by four charioteers emitting sound like the rumblings of clouds.\" \"This chariot has twenty quivers, ten frightening bows, and eight bow strings of golden colour lay arranged in the chariot.\" \"It has two swords off our cubits and ten cubits long swords provided with hilts hanging on its sides as decoration.\" \"Wearing red garland s round the neck, brave, like a mountain in form, dark with large mouth, like death, like sun veiled by clouds he seems.\" \"By adorning armlets, his both arms are like high peaks of Himalaya mountain shining away.\" \"He who shines like the full moon between two Punarvasu stars, his auspicious eyes and countenance shines with both earrings.\" \"Oh! Vibheeshana, a mighty armed one! Show me that foremost of Rakshasas, whom all Vanaras feared and fled in all directions.\" Interrogated by the highly brilliant prince Raghava, energetic Vibheeshana revealed. \"The tenheaded and highly brilliant king Ravana, who is the brother of Vysravana, is of terrible deeds and highly exploitative.\" \"To him was born a blessed son, valiant one, compeer of Ravana, who served elders, learned and well versed in sastras.\" \"He is best in riding on horseback, on elephant back and in the use of sword and bow. He is capable of sowing dissension, making peace, giving charity and statecraft.\" \"He is known as Atikaya, son of Dhanyamalini. Lanka remains fearless on his shoulders, you may know.\" \"By penance on supreme self he propitiated Brahma, who blessed him with mystic missiles by way of boons by which his enemies were subdued.\" \"Exemption from death from gods and demons was given to him and all this wonderful shield and chariot as bright as the sun.\" \"By this (boon) hundreds of Devatas and demons were defeated by him, Yakshas were killed, nay Rakshasas were protected.\" \"Here is strong Atikaya, a wise son of Ravana, bull among Rakshasas, who is a subduer of the pride of Devas and Danavas, by whom thunderbolt of Indra was obstructed firmly in battle and likewise the noose of Varuna was repelled in war.\" \"Here is strong Atikaya, a wise son of Ravana, bull among Rakshasas, who is a subduer of the pride of Devas and Danavas, by whom thunderbolt of Indra was obstructed firmly in battle and likewise the noose of Varuna was repelled in war.\" \"Oh, best of men! Quickly make efforts to put an end to him before he puts down Vanara army.\" Thereafter, mighty Atikaya entered the monkey army, twanged his bow again and again and made a loud noise. Observing the dreadful enemy seated on the chariot, the foremost of the great Vanaras rushed towards him. Kumuda, Dwivida, Mainda, Neela, even Sarabha, all at once assailed him with trees and mountain peaks. Atikaya, endowed with extraordinary energy, efficient in the use of weapons, shattered the trees and rocks hurled by the Vanaras with his arrows adorned with gold. The powerful night ranger of terrible form, pierced all monkeys who were facing him in the battlefield with iron arrows. The monkeys were hard pressed by Atikaya's hail of arrows. Their limbs broke and were unable to resist. Just as a young lion with youthful pride would strike a group of deer, the enraged Rakshasa struck the army of monkey heroes. The Rakshasa lord, wielding a weapon in the midst of the monkey army, indeed did not strike any, but armed with bow and quiver went with pride towards Rama and spoke. \"I am with a bow and arrow seated in the chariot. Indeed, I am not strong in fighting with common warriors. Whoever is interested to fight now can come speedily to fight with me.\" On hearing Atikaya, Saumithri the destroyer of enemies, became angry, not enduring and not able to tolerate went towards him taking a sword. Furious Saumithri, springing up, took up his arrow from the quiver, stretching to full length before he discharged the arrow. The twang of Lakshmana filled the mountains, earth, ocean, and all directions striking terrible fear in the night ranger. Then the extraordinarily energetic and powerful son of Rakshasa king was in turn frightened at the sound of Saumithri's bow and was astonished. Seeing Atikaya, furious Lakshmana sprang up and took a sharp shaft and spoke as follows. \"O Saumithri! You are valiant but young, not able to discriminate. I am equal to the Lord of death. Why do you desire to comb at with me?\" The shafts discharged from my arm can't be borne, by the Himalayas, even the atmosphere between the sky and earth can't bear the force. \"Why do you want to arouse the fire of dissolution sleeping comfortably? Return, casting away your bow, without confronting. Go away.\" \"Or else if you want to oppose and not return, give up your life and proceed to Yama's abode.\" \"See my sharp shafts capable of reducing enemy's pride like Ishwara's trident, ornamented with polished gold.\" \"These arrows are like serpents and can drink your blood just as an angry lion drinks the blood of elephants. Therefore, I tell you\", said Atikaya to Lakshmana.\" Prince Atikaya, having spoken as said before, fitted his bow in wrath. Hearing the proud statement of Atikaya, the highminded Lakshmana, endowed with strength, enraged, and spoke these words of great meaning. \"You are evil minded. By mere statement you people can't become good chiefs. I stand armed with a bow and arrow. Prove your strength.\" \"Reveal yourself by action not by indication. You do not deserve it. He who is with prowess is a right hero.\" \"You are seated in the chariot with all kinds of weapons collected. By that alone you do not become capable. Show your capacity.\" \"Then I will strike down his head with sharp arrows and throw him just as ripened palm fruit drops in the process of time.\" \"Now, you will drink the blood ejected from your neck by the holes made with my pointed arrows decked with polished gold.\" \"You should not underestimate me thinking I am young or old to win. You do not know that I am spirit of death in battle. Did not Vishnu as young Trivikrama win the three worlds going by three strides?\" On hearing the words of Lakshmana, which was reasonable and full of truth, Atikaya became furious and took up the best of arrows. Then vidhyadharas, demons, devatas, daityas, sages and great guhyakas arrived at the battlefield to witness. Then enraged Atikaya, fixing his arrow to the bow as if discharging it in the sky directed at Lakshmana. Lakshmana, the heroic destroyer of enemies, shattered the venomous serpent like arrow with his sharp half moon shaped arrow. Seeing the arrow torn asunder like a serpent, Atikaya was offended and became very angry and fitted five arrows to his bow. The night ranger set loose those arrows at Lakshmana, Bharata's brother. Lakshmana shattered them even before it reached him. Lakshmana, the heroic destroyer of foes, having split those arrows, seized a shaft which was a bright and sharp flaming arrow. Valiant Lakshmana, foremost of the wielders of bow stretching his bow till the ear, quickly discharged the arrow. The heroic Lakshmana fully stretching the arrow bending to curvature struck Atikaya, the foremost of Rakshasas on his forehead. That arrow stuck on the forehead of the terrific Rakshasa looked like a serpent on a mountain. Now tormented by Lakshmana's arrow the Rakshasa was shaken dreadfully like the gate of Tripura (the city built of gold, silver, and iron in heaven, in space and earth by Maya and burnt by Rudra). Recovering from the hurt and reflecting, the Rakshasa contemplated the course of action, and said 'By releasing the arrow on me you are an enemy worthy of praise.\" Having spoken that way bending his face setting both shoulders right, he settled at the rear end of the chariot started to move from the chariot. The bull among the Rakshasas taking, one, three, five and seven arrows, fixing them to the bow stretching released. The gold feathered arrows released from the rakshasas's bow, were like death arrows which shone in the sky as if the sky was glowing. Raghava's brother remained unconfounded and then he shattered the volley of many sharp arrows released by the Rakshasa. Ravana's son, an enemy of Indra, observing that all arrows have been ineffective, took up another sharp arrow. Highly energetic Atikaya, fixing another arrow released it between the breasts of Saumithri and pierced. In the battle, Saumithri was hurt in the chest by Atikaya's arrow and blood flowed like the ichor from elephant in rut. He (Lakshmana) being glorious and noble himself seized hold of the pointed arrow stuck in his body and removed it with a mystic spell. Then Lakshmana by concentration of his mind fixed on fire god which presided over the arrow, that great selffixed in his bow glowed. Highly energetic Atikaya took a serpentlike arrow with gold feathers and charged it by the concentration of his mind on the power of Sun god. Lakshmana placed that fierce, glowing missile looking like the staff of God of death on Atikaya. The night ranger, seeing the missile charged with fire god coming towards him, released the glowing arrow charged with the power of Sun god. Both the arrows effulgent, flaming with fire, were like angry serpents in the sky striking one another violently. Those two burning one another and themselves burning had fallen on the earth surface with no fire. Those two best of arrows though glowing, having fallen on earth did not shine as they ceased to emit flames and had been reduced to ashes. Those two burning one another and themselves burning had fallen on the earth surface with no fire. Those two best of arrows though glowing, having fallen on earth did not shine as they ceased to emit flames and had been reduced to ashes. Then Atikaya seized with anger discharged Ishikam presided over by Twashta (the architect of gods). Saumithri then split the arrow with one presided by Indra and split Ishikam. Annoyed by his arrow Ishikam being struck, Atikaya, son of Ravana charged Lakshmana's arrow with an arrow presided over by Yama. Then the night ranger shattered the arrow of Lakshmana and in turn released an arrow presided by Vayu. And then enraged Lakshmana covered with water like a rainy cloud would shower with torrents. On those arrows touching Atikaya's diamond like body, the pointed arrows shattered the coat covering the body and the broken coat of nails had fallen down. Lakshmana of great fame, subduer of enemy looking at the arrows becoming useless mighty hero released thousand arrows. Though covered with arrows showered on him, mighty Rakshasa Atikaya had an impenetrable shield in the battlefield and could not feel the torment. Atikaya released an arrow resembling a poisonous serpent at Lakshmana. Pierced in vital part Saumithri, the tormentor of the enemy lost consciousness for a while. Then mighty subduer of enemies, regaining senses, getting up destroyed the chariot pole with rain of arrows. Taking up four best arrows he struck down the chariot, charioteer, and the horses. Then mighty subduer of enemies, regaining senses, getting up destroyed the chariot pole with rain of arrows. Taking up four best arrows he struck down the chariot, charioteer, and the horses. Saumithri, son of Sumithra, was not able to inflict injury on that Rakshasa with those arrows, though desiring to kill him. Wind god (Vayu) having come to the best of men, Lakshmana, spoke to him that in battle it is not possible to injure him or kill him. By the boon given by Brahma his body is covered with armour which can't be broken. By Brahma's weapon only you can strike to kill him because of his armour and might. By any other weapon it is not possible to kill him. Then Saumithri who is equal to Indra hearing wind god's words invoked Brahma's weapon into service. While he was charging into his arrows and fixing the arrow went at terrific speed. As Saumithri charged the sharp pointed foremost arrow, the directions, moon, Sun and other planets and the sky, earth, and all space shook. Golden feathered arrow, which resembled thunderbolt, was released on Atikaya, enemy of Indra for whom it was like a messenger of death. It was charged with Brahma's mystic by Saumithri and released on fixing it. Atikaya saw the arrow of Lakshmana coming at a speed, which possessed the velocity of the wind, fixed with feathers resembling the wings of Garuda in the battle. As Atikaya was looking at the arrow, Lakshmana struck many arrows forcibly with sharp arrows possessing the speed of Garuda. The arrows reached towards Atikaya. Perceiving the glowing arrow coming, like the spirit of death, Atikaya struck it with unceasing effort with javelins, spears, maces, axes, tridents and even arrows. This great arrow of Lakshmana glowing like fire rendered the weapons in wonderful shapes released by Atikaya unsuccessful and severed the head of Atikaya decked with a crown. Struck by Lakshmana's arrow, the crowned head of Atikaya fell on the ground like Himalaya peak. All the Rakshasas who escaped from killing, felt distressed seeing the king and his ornaments scattered on the ground. All the Rakshasas with desperate looks, their pride hurt, became very sad and burst into discordant tones roared aloud. With Leader killed, the night rangers were afraid. Listless they ran quickly towards Lanka. Enemy who was difficult to approach and of terrible might being killed, the Vanaras were extremely delighted. Their faces looked like lotuses in bloom. Filled with joy they worshipped Lakshmana.",
                "On hearing that Atikaya was killed by highly energetic Lakshmana, the king was overtaken by emotion and spoke as follows. \"Dhumraksha, a highly intolerant one, Akampana, the foremost of the Rakshasas and skilled in the use of bow and arms, in the same way Prahastha, Kumbhakarna of stupendous valour and heroes among Rakshasas desiring for combat, who have never been defeated and conquerors of hostile armies, have been killed.

Rakshasas can't stand his range.\" \"This city and even the Ashoka grove where Sita is kept secretly to be guarded by being vigilant on all sides.\" \"Wherever the troops are posted here and there be it exit, or entrance should be checked again and again and not to go out.\" \"Surrounded by the army on all sides, whoever it may be, keep watching the movement of Vanaras.\" \" At all times, whether it is evening or midnight or early morning, Vanaras movements are to be watched by the army without indifference.

Indeed, the army should be active or inactive, standing, advancing constantly and staying wherever they are.\" On hearing the words of the king of Lanka all Rakshasas and the great army got up. Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, enjoined the Rakshasas and himself bearing the thorn of wrath, entered the abode desperately.",
                "Then the Rakshasas who survived the killings, hurriedly reported to the Rakshasa king, Ravana about the killing of Devanthaka, Trisira and Atikaya. There upon the king, getting to know suddenly about the dreadful killing of his son and brother lost his senses. His eyes were filled with tears, and he was thinking seriously. Thereafter, seeing the desperate Rakshasa king immersed in a sea of sorrow, Indrajith, son of Ravana, foremost of the chariot riders, submitted as follows. \"Dear king of Rakshasas! Do not give way to despair when Indrajith is alive. Indeed, struck by Indrajith's arrows in battle it is not possible for anyone to be with life.\" \"Now you will see Rama along with Lakshmana also, their body torn into pieces along with their army their life ceased, lying on the ground pierced with arrows all over the limbs.\" \"Listen to this vow of Indra's enemy, which is fully determined and combined with manliness and divinity. I shall put an end to Rama and Lakshmana with my wonderful arrows.\" \"Today, Indra, Vishnu, Mitra, Sadhyas, Vysvanara, moon and Sun will witness my immeasurable prowess as they witnessed the terrible prowess of Vishnu at the fire sacrifice of Bali.\" (Indrajith) having spoken in that manner, taking leave of the king, the enemy of Indra (the ruler of gods), ascended the chariot swift as wind in speed, drawn by the best of donkeys. Highly energetic he (Indrajith) was, a tamer of enemies, seated in the chariot that was like Indra's, quickly went to the battlefield from there. Many Rakshasas of terrific valour, endowed with extraordinary strength, happily, wielding excellent bows, taking barbed missiles, hammers, whetted axes, maces, Bhusandi mallets, Ayasthis, Sataghnis, and Parighas, making noise, went following great Indrajith. Some went on the back of elephants and horses, tigers as large as mountains, scorpions, cats, donkeys, and camels. As well as on serpents, lions, tigers, and jackals.

Some went on the back of elephants and horses, tigers as large as mountains, scorpions, cats, donkeys, and camels. As well as on serpents, lions, tigers, and jackals. The Rakshasas went on praising the enemy of Indra, Indrajith, making noise, blowing conchs in full blast, beating drums. He, the destroyer of foes went with white parasols like a full moon shine in the sky. Thereafter the chief hero went decked with golden ornaments, fanned by archers holding whisks with gold handles. Ravana, the prosperous king of Rakshasas, seeing his son sallying forth surrounded by huge army spoke. \"Son! there is no adversary who can fight with you sitting in a chariot. Indra has been won by you. What to say about mortals like Rama who can be assailed by you.\"Rakshasa king having spoken that way, Indrajith accepted the blessings and departed. Then Lanka shone like the Sun in the sky with Indrajith who was effulgent like the Sun and matchless in valour shone. Upon reaching the battlefield, he, the tamer of foes, highly energetic Indrajith, ranged the Rakshasas around the chariot. Then the foremost of Rakshasas, who was like fire god in brilliance worshipped fire god with chanting of mantras as per tradition. The heroic Rakshasa king worshipped according to tradition with flowers and fragrance followed by parched grain and fire god. In that fire sacrifice, weapons were leaves, bibika sticks were fuel, red pieces of cloth were used, and in the same way the ladle for sacrifice was made of iron. There he strewed into the fire, lances as leaves, dark coloured live go at clasped by its neck and consigned. From the fire set ablaze by the of fearing of fire sticks into it was free from smoke burst into flames indicating victory. The fire god himself, decked in polished gold ornaments turned round and accepted the offerings. He, with whom weapons are adept invoked weapon presided over by Brahma and charged his own chariot with it. While the missile was being invoked and fire sacrifice was done, all planets, moon, Sun, and Stars in the sky shook in fear. Flaming like fire god, endowed with the prowess of Indra, possessing inconceivable form, Indrajith with his bow, arrows and chariot disappeared into the sky. Then, the Rakshasa army filled with horses and chariots, graced with pennants and flags, desiring to fight went roaring aloud. They began to strike Vanaras, with many wonderfully decorated, sharp and swift arrows, lances, and tridents. Thereafter enraged Ravana's son looking at the Rakshasas said, \"Be happy and kill the Vanaras in fight.\" Thereafter the Rakshasas roaring and longing for victory rained arrows in a terrific manner at the Vanaras. Indrajith, remaining concealed and surrounded by Rakshasas, destroyed the Vanaras with nalikas, steel arrows and maces. Struck in the battle by Indrajith, the Vanaras rained heavily armed with trees and rocks. Mighty and energetic son of Ravana, Indrajith became angry and began to attack the Vanaras. Filled with anger, Indrajith alone with nine, five, seven arrows tore the Vanaras into pieces. Hero Indrajith, who is difficult to conquer in battle, killed the Vanaras with sun like arrows decorated with gold. Pierced by arrows in the battle, those Vanaras with their necks broken, giving up hopes of winning, frustrated, fell like the demons oppressed by great gods. Then the bulls among Vanaras rushed in the battlefield towards Indrajith whose arrows were dreadful and blazing like the Sun 's rays. Then Vanaras with their bodies broken, courage and consciousness lost, blood flowed from mutilated bodies. Vanaras, armed with rocks in the battle, roaring and not turning back, stood for the cause, giving up their life. The Vanaras retreated back to the battle and rained on Ravana's son, trees, mountains and rocks. Energetic Indrajith, who is ever victorious in battle dispersed the deadly rain of rocks and trees capable of taking out life. Then the Lord of Rakshasas dispersed the complete army of Vanaras with arrows burning like fire and resembling venomous serpents. He shattered Gandhamadana with eighteen very sharp arrows and Nala standing at far with nine arrows. Indrajith, the eminent hero, hurt Mainda in private parts and even afflicted Gaja with five spades in the battle. Then he struck Jambavan with ten, Neela with thirty, and Sugriva, Rshaba and Angada. In the same way Dwivida with sharp and terrific arrows that were bestowed upon him as boons and made them lose consciousness. Highly enraged like the fire at the time of universal destruction, he tormented many chiefs of Vanaras and others. He, with his swift moving arrows, bright like the Sun , stretching to the ear hurt many vanaras in that great war. Seeing the vast Vanara army deluded by the net of arrows, Indrajith was very happy. Highly energetic, mighty, and swift Indrajith raining sharp arrows and weapons quickly Devastated the Vanara army. Highly energetic, mighty, and swift Indrajith raining sharp arrows and weapons quickly Devastated the Vanara army. Leaving from his own army space, moving swiftly, remaining concealed in the blue sky like a rain cloud, Indrajith rained a net of arrows. In the battle, the Vanaras who were like mountains, became victims of cheating, and were struck by Indrajith's thunderbolt like arrows. Their bodies were broken and shrieking in discordant tones they fell like mountains. The Vanara troops saw only the sharp pointed arrows covering them. They could not see the enemy of Indra being concealed by magical power. Thereafter the mighty Lord of Rakshasas despatched volley of sharp tipped arrows bright like the Sun, at Vanara leaders on all sides and eradicated. He rained a violent shower of tridents, swords and axes burning like sacrificial fire shedding flames with fire sparks on the Vanara army. Struck by Indrajith's arrows, the (bodies of) Vanara troops were glowing like Kimsuka trees (red in colour) bearing flowers. Hit by the Rakshasa king, the bulls among Vanaras gliding towards one another roared in discordant tones and fell down. Some Vanaras looking up to the sky eyes pierced with arrows held one another and fell on the ground.

Having hurt the Vanara leaders with maces and arrows shining like gold, he rained volley of arrows shining like sun rays on Lakshmana and Rama. Most wonderful and prosperous Rama, looking at the rain of arrows continuing to shower, not minding it as if they are rain of water drops, spoke this to Lakshmana. \"Lakshmana! Rakshasa king, an enemy of Indra afflicted the Vanaras with the Brahmastram secured by him. Using that power, he is tormenting us with sharp arrows.\" \"How can it be possible now to destroy that great Indrajith who is conferred with boons of invincibility by the creator Brahma, who is steadfast and is concealed in dreadful form with weapons uplifted?\" \"This weapon of him (Indrajith) is that of the glorious creator and is presided by Him. By that reason he is inconceivable. O! Wise Lakshmana, remain calm and undisturbed at this hail of arrows.\" \"This Rakshasa king is covered thickly with volley of arrows on all sides. Able warriors of Vanaras are falling and not happy.\" \"This Indrajith is desisting from comb at on seeing us. As the Vanaras have lost pride and happiness and fallen into unconscious state, he would surely think that he has attained prosperity after victory in war and surely enter Lanka, the abode of enemies of god.\" Seeing the two princes severed and fallen down struck by the net of arrows of Indrajith, he roared happily in the battle. Thereafter Vanara army withdrew from the battle along with Rama and Lakshmana. Indrajith for his part moved to the abode protected by Ravana's arms, while being praised. He at once entered the city happily and related everything to the father.    This is the Seventy third sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by Sage Valmiki.",
                "The two brothers (Rama and Lakshmana) become unconscious in the forefront of the battle the monkey leaders lose senses. Sugriva, Neela, Angada and Jambavantha did not know What to do. Thereafter, foremost among the wise, Vibheeshana observing the despondency of the monkey leaders spoke to them reassuring in incomparable words. \"O Noble men! Do not fear. Rama and Lakshmana are afflicted by Indrajith's volley of arrows and have lost senses. They are despondent to honour the statement of the creator not otherwise.\" To him (Indrajith), the creator has conferred this weapon of Brahma endowed with terrific speed. To respect the missile both the princes have fallen. Why do you grieve? Thereafter, hearing Vibheeshana's words, wise Hanuman spoke this with respect to the missile of Brahma. \"Whoever is strong among Vanaras, have been struck and are alive breathing among the Vanaras. Let us restore their confidence.\" The two heroes, Hanuman and Vibheeshana, and the foremost of Rakshasas with torch in hand searched for the left over Vanaras in the battlefield. Two of them saw the ground covered with Vanaras of mountainlike forms, who had fallen with tails cut off, some with broken thighs, broken legs and fingers, necks severed, letting off blood, discharging urine and glowing weapons lying on the ground. Two of them saw the ground covered with Vanaras of mountainlike forms, who had fallen with tails cut off, some with broken thighs, broken legs and fingers, necks severed, letting off blood, discharging urine and glowing weapons lying on the ground. Vibheeshana and Hanuman saw in the battlefield Sugriva, Angada, Neela, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha, Sushena, Vegadarsi, Ahuka, Mainda, Nala, Jyothimukha, Dwivida and Panasa struck down. Vibheeshana and Hanuman saw in the battlefield Sugriva, Angada, Neela, Sarabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha, Sushena, Vegadarsi, Ahuka, Mainda, Nala, Jyothimukha, Dwivida and Panasa struck down. By the creator's missile Indrajith struck down sixtyseven crores of strong Vanaras between the fifth and last part of the day. Vibheeshana and Hanuman seeing the ocean of Vanara army and the glowing arrows on them, looked for Jambavantha. Paulastya (Vibheeshana of Paulastya clan), seeing the son of Prajapathi (Jambavan), who by nature was wise and aged, afflicted by hundreds of arrows, like a cooling fire sacrifice, went close by and spoke these words. \"O Noble Jambavan! Indeed, your life has not been afflicted with these sharp arrows.\" Hearing this, Jambavan uttered these words with difficulty.\" \"O Noble Jambavan! Indeed, your life has not been afflicted with these sharp arrows.\" Hearing this, Jambavan uttered these words with difficulty.\" \"Great hero, Vibheeshana! I recognise you by your voice. Pierced with sharp arrows I am not able to see you.\" Vibheeshana (Rakshasa)! Indeed, Hanuman, the foremost of Vanaras, by whose birth, Anjana and Supraja are blessed as parents, are they alive? After hearing Jambavantha, Vibheeshana said \"Noble son, why are you enquiring about Hanuman?\" \"Noble one! You are showing affection to Hanuman but not to King Sugriva, or Angada or even Raghava?\" On hearing Vibheeshana, the tiger among Rakshasas, Jambavan replied, \"Listen why I enquired about Maruthi.\" If this hero Hanuman is alive, even if the army is destroyed and if we are alive, it is like dead only. \"Dear! If Hanuman who is equal to wind god, resembles Vyshvanara (God of fire) is breathing, then we can hope to live (for life).\" Thereafter, Hanuman the son of the wind god coming close to the aged Jambavan clasped his feet in accordance with tradition and greeted him. Then again, Jambavan whose senses were affected, on hearing the statement of Hanuman, the foremost of Vanaras, felt as though he was born again. Then brilliant Jambavan spoke to Hanuman, the tiger among Vanaras, on reaching him. \"You ought to protect the Vanaras.\" \"You are fully endowed with prowess and great friend of monkeys in that way. It is time for you to show your talent. Indeed, I do not see anyone else.\" For the Bears and Vanaras, create excessive happiness. For Rama and Lakshmana who are unconscious, make them comfortable. \"Hanuman, you ought to go very far over the sea to the Himalayas, the highest mountain.\" \"O Destroyer of enemies! there on top you will see the foremost of the mountain Rshaba and on the peak of Kailasa.\" \"Heroic Hanuman! In the middle of those two mountains, you will see a highly splendid mountain covered with all kinds of medicinal herbs.\" \"O Tiger among monkeys! You will see on the summit four medicinal herbs growing there illuminating the ten directions.\" \"Mrtasanjivani, Visalyakarani, Suvarnakarani, Sandhani, all these herbs are grown there.\" \"Hanuman, taking the four herbs you, the son of wind god ought to return immediately with the speed of wind, to unite the life of the monkeys and reassure.\" \"Hearing the instruction of Jambavantha, the son of the wind god, infused with wind speed as the ocean, heaves with the force of wind increasing his strength fully.\" Standing on the summit of the foremost of the mountains, hero Hanuman pressing his feet seemed like a second mountain Trodden by the feet of Hanuman that mountain pressed forcibly by himself could not bear his strength. Oppressed by the speed of Hanuman, the mountain fell to the ground and by the impetuosity of his speed the mountain got shattered. As the foremost of the mountain got oppressed it crushed the trees and rocks on it and Vanaras were unable to stand on it. Then the mighty gates of Lanka shaking, homes shattered, stricken with fear that night it seemed Lanka was dancing. Son of the wind god, who was like a mountain supported by earth, pressing hard caused the earth with its ocean to shake. From that mountain the monkey sprang to Malaya Mountain which was like Meru and Mandara mountains. It was set with various springs, covered with various trees and creepers, abounded with lotuses, frequented by Devas, Gandharvas. It was sixty yojanas high and visited by Vidhyadharas, celestial nymphs, and sages, filled with various species of deer and numerous caves. Yakshas, Gandharvas, and Kinnaras were living there. There the son of the wind god grew in size like a cloud. From that mountain the monkey sprang to Malaya Mountain which was like Meru and Mandara mountains.

It was sixty yojanas high and visited by Vidhyadharas, celestial nymphs, and sages, filled with various species of deer and numerous caves. Yakshas, Gandharvas, and Kinnaras were living there. There the son of the wind god grew in size like a cloud. Pressing the mountain hard by his feet, opening his largemouth wide, he roared like Rakshasas to make Rakshasas fearful. All the Rakshasas in Lanka hearing the loud roar of Hanuman were afraid and could not stir from there. Maruti, scorcher of enemies, endowed with terrific valour offered prayers to Sri Rama and made up his mind to embark on the stupendous task for Raghava. Raising his tail which resembled a serpent, bending his back, and ears, opening his mouth wide expounded Hanuman sprang up at terrific speed. By the speed of his arms and thighs clusters of branches of trees, mountains, rocks, and common monkeys were attracted, and with reduction of speed along the way the rocks fell. Stretching his arms which resembled coils of serpents, whose valour equalled Garuda, enemy of serpents, as if attracting all the directions went to the summit of the foremost mountain which equalled Meru mountain. Observing the ocean whose waves were made to revolve round (by his speed), exceedingly, whose creatures were made to whirl round violently (by the wind force generated by his speed), he went forth like the wheel loosened from Vishnu's hand. Watching the mountains, trees, birds, rivers, tanks, the best of cities, all of them and prosperous people, he went at his father's speed. Hanuman who was equal to his father in prowess, went unwearied, hurriedly in the path of the Sun. Maruthi, the tiger among monkeys went like the wind possessing great speed filling sound in all directions. Going at wind speed, the great monkey Maruthi, remembering Jambavantha's words, reached and sighted the Himalayas. He reached the foremost of mountains, which was adorned with different kinds of springs, many caves and cascades and graced with trees. The peaks were like masses of white autumn clouds graced with splendour and beautiful to look at. Reaching there he saw the tall and terrifying peaks of the Lord of mountains frequented by Devatas and sages, meritorious hermitages. He saw the seat of Brahma, the abode of Rajathanabha, the abode of Indra, the location from which Rudra discharged an arrow (at Tripura), the abode of Lord Hayagriva, and glowing abode of the deity presiding over Brahmastra and Vyvasvatah's attendants. He saw Vajralayam (where Brahma gave Indra the thunderbolt), the abode of Kubera shining like the Sun, the spot where the Sun was bound, Brahma's abode and the abode of the bow of Lord Siva, and the earth navel. He saw Kailas, the rocks of Himalayas, that way on the Rshaba the foremost Lord Siva, the golden mountain, and the great mountain on which grew, glowing medicinal herbs. Observing the herbs blazing like fire, he was astonished at the herbs on the mountain and went round thinking of the names of herbs (asked by Jambavan). The great monkey, son of the wind god, having traversed a thousand yojanas began to range the wonderful herbs and went about searching. Perceiving a seeker coming for them, the herbs all over the wonderful mountain disappeared. The great soul Hanuman was not able to see, those herbs, became angry and his eyes were burning like fire in anger. He jumped up and roared and said to the lordly mountain. \"O King of mountains! You are not showing compassion to Raghava. Is it your determination to be like this? Overcome by my shoulder strength I shall crush you now. You may see.\" Seizing hold of the peaks vehemently, its trees, elephants, gold mines withthousands of minerals he crushed the projections and set fire and burnt and uprooted swiftly. Striking terror among Devatas and demons and leaders inhabiting the world, uprooting the mountain he hurried at Garuda's speed into the sky praised by aerial creatures. Resembling the Sun closely, radiant like the Sun he was taking the top of the mountain, betaking himself in the vicinity of the Sun he was like another Sun. He, the son of the wind god sitting upon the crag, was delightful like Vishnu with a flaming wheel shining. Observing him high the Vanaras became joyful, and he also saw them. Hearing their loud noise becoming aware of the Rakshasas of Lanka also roared in terrible fear. The great Hanuman along with the mountain descended in the midst of the Vanara army, and greeted the army head bent down and embraced Vibheeshana standing there. The two sons of the ruler of men inhaling the fragrance of the herbs became free from wounds. Other Vanara heroes also got restored. All those Vanara warriors killed were restored with life instantly by the fragrance. Those who were asleep also got up when they became fully awake. From the beginning of the war in Lanka till the end without exception, all the Rakshasas were killed in war by the Vanara leaders then and there were thrown into the ocean by Ravana's instruction, not to have means of proof.

                "Sugriva, the king of Vanaras called Hanuman to make him know the task ahead and said these words. \" As Kumbhakarna is killed and his sons are destroyed, Ravana may not putup defence again. I think.\" \"Of the bulls among vanaras, endowed with prowess, whoever is quick, able and foremost, let them go to Lanka, the abode of Ravana.\" Thereafter the bulls among Vanaras turned their faces towards Lanka and went holding torches in hand, after the Sun set as the frightening night started. Vanara troops went all over with torches and chased by them, the Rakshasas at the gates ran instantly. Rejoiced Vanaras set fire to the towering gates, attics, different streets as well as mansions to send away Rakshasas. Then thousands of their houses were burnt by fire (consumer of offerings), and mountain like mansions collapsed to the ground. There, in Lanka, incense and the best of sandalwood was burnt. Nay even glossy pearls, gems and diamonds were also burnt. Their white linen and beautiful silks were burnt. Nay, even several blankets of wool, chests and weapons were also burnt. Different kinds of peculiar kinds of ornaments used to decorate horses, ornaments worn round the neck and girths of elephants, and polished chariot decorations. Leather armour of the warriors, shields of horses, excellent bow strings, swords, arrows, goads, lances, and javelins. With fire all over, rugs made of hair of animals, whisks made of fur of animals, tiger skins, musk, wonderful pearls, and gems in laid dwellings of many kinds, and clusters of war weapons were burnt.

The fire consumed the houses which were strong and impenetrable, with many enclosures, magnificent ones, constructed in gold in the shape of a half moon and full moon, windows endowed with wonderful pictures. All over the rooms were high on top, decorated with gems, and as if touching the Sun. It was rendered noisy with notes of herons and peacocks, playing of Veena, and jingling of ornaments like the vibration of sounds. The dwellings which looked like mountains were consumed by fire.

It was rendered noisy with notes of herons and peacocks, playing of Veena, and jingling of ornaments like the vibration of sounds. The dwellings which looked like mountains were consumed by fire. The archways covered with a touch of fire shone like lightning in summer, girt round like clusters of clouds. The mansions burnt by fire fell down like a huge mountain struck by a thunderbolt. The lovely women sleeping in burnt mansion tops screamed loudly in desperation saying 'Alas! Oh Oh!' and removing their ornaments. Like peaks of mountains struck by thunderbolt the mansions also fell, caught in fire. As the mansions were burning, they shone like the peaks of Himalayas glowing at a distance. While the tops of dwellings were burning, flames were blazing, and Lanka seemed adorned with Kimsuka blossoms. In Lanka with the elephants set free, horses set free by the guards, it was like an agitated ocean at the end of the world cycle. Some horses that were released, went in different directions afraid of elephants. Some elephants seeing horses ran away in fear. While Lanka was burning its image reflected in the ocean made the ocean look like an ocean of red waters. Set fire by the monkeys, in a short while, the city was like a land flaming out of dreadful destruction in the world. By the smoke that spread, scorched by the fire, the clamour of the women folk at the top of their voice was heard at a hundred yojanas. And thereafter the monkeys who were eager to fight assailed the Rakshasas who came out suddenly unable to bear the burning of the bodies. The clamour of the monkeys and the sighing of the Rakshasas resounded in all the ten directions including the ocean as well as the earth. The two great souls, Rama, and Lakshmana, both relieved of pain seized hold of excellent and wellknown bows. Then Rama drew the best of bow, that created fear among the Rakshasas by its tumultuous sound. Then, great Rama stretching his bow in great fury shone as though the divine Lord Siva was stretching his bow with imprints of Vedas. That sound of the twang of Rama's bow could be heard very high over and above the sounds of the Vanaras and Rakshasas. The sound of Rama's bow twang, the clamour of the Vanaras as well as the wailing of Rakshasas, all the three could be heard in all ten directions. The entrance gate of Lanka, which was like Kailasa, crumbled and fell by the shaft released from the bow of Rama. Seeing Rama's arrows on the highrise mansions and houses, the Rakshasa leaders started preparing for comb at out of fear. As the Rakshasa leaders were preparing (for attack) and emitting leonine roar, night came upon like the night of Rudra (night of final dissolution). Sugriva the great king of Vanaras commanded all the bulls among Vanaras, to encounter after reaching the gate of Lanka. \"He who is staying wherever they are does not obey the king's command will be killed for being guilty of flouting the command\", ordered Sugriva to the Vanaras. Sugriva the great king of Vanaras commanded all the bulls among Vanaras, to encounter after reaching the gate of Lanka. \"He who is staying wherever they are does not obey the king's command will be killed for being guilty of flouting the command\", ordered Sugriva to the Vanaras. Holding burning torches in hand the Vanara chiefs reached and standing at the gate, saw that Ravana was overtaken by anger. The ten directions were disturbed violently by his yawning and his wrath was perceptible like Rudra' s form in his limbs by his wrath. Seized with anger, he sent for Kumbha and Nikumbha, both the sons of Kumbhakarna and many Rakshasas. Yupaksha, Sonithaksha, Prajangha, Kampana set out with both the sons of Kumbhakarna. Roaring like a lion, he ordered all the Rakshasas of extraordinary strength to proceed instantly. Ordered by him again and again, the Rakshasa warriors went from Lanka with glowing weapons offering salutations to him. The Rakshasas by the effulgence of ornaments and by themselves illumined all over the sky like monkeys did with torches. There the radiance of the moon and stars and the splendour of their ornaments brightened the sky. The moon light and the splendour of the ornaments, also the light of shining ocean and dwellings lit up the Vanara and Rakshasa armies. There the waves of the ocean shone brightly getting united with the fire of half burnt houses. Then the Rakshasa army appeared terrific, fixed with flags and poles, equipped with best of axes, horses yoked to formidable chariots and elephants different kinds of foot soldiers, distinguished by wielding shining tridents, maces, swords spears and lances warriors of frightening valour and prowess holding shining barbed missiles hundreds of tiny bells tied to the chariots and elephants making noise  warriors endowed with arms decorated with gold, with axes and weapons to pierce arrows fixed to the bows, with an abundance of fragrance.

Crowded with fierce warriors coming like thundering rainy clouds, the Rakshasas, and the monkey troops coming forward made loud noises with an elevated tone. The great army of Rakshasas rushed towards the hostile army just as moths flew up towards flame. Their Clubs and Asanis brandished by rubbing with their arms, the great army of Rakshasas appeared very bright. Thereafter the monkeys eager to fight with night rangers rose as if gone mad striking the night rangers with trees and rocks. When the Rakshasas showed up in that manner, the monkeys approaching them cut off their heads instantly with sharp swords. The Rakshasas with ears bitten off by the teeth of the monkeys, skulls smashed with fists, and limbs broken with blows of rocks they moved about. In the aforesaid manner the Vanaras struck more night rangers of terrific appearance, great heroes in front of them with sharp swords. One struck another, who was striking the other. One threw down another who was throwing the other. One abused another reproaching contemptuously, and one bit his rival biting the other. There they conversed this way with one another 'One said hit me and another one offered to hit,', again another intervened and said, 'Why are you crying?' meaning I offer resistance, one said 'Why are you suffering like this?'. Highly enraged Vanaras and Rakshasas fought with them, raiment slipping, shields and weapons dodged, huge lances lifted to fight. They used fists, tridents, spears, and swords. Highly enraged Vanaras and Rakshasas fought with them, raiment slipping, shields and weapons dodged, huge lances lifted to fight. They used fists, tridents, spears, and swords. In that fight the Rakshasas killed the Vanaras at the rate of ten to seven and the Vanaras struck down Rakshasas at the rate of ten to seven.",
                "While the fierce fight brought destruction of heroes in the ongoing combat, Angada eager to fight, assailed gallant Kampana. Kampana struck Angada challenging himin anticipation. He swiftly hurled a mace in anger and hurt him grievously and Angada reeled. Rejuvenated Angada, after gaining consciousness acquired a mountain peak and shattered Kampana with a blow. wounded Kampana fell down. Then seeing Kampana killed, Sonitaksha, a fearless hero, quickly reached Angada by chariot. He (Sonitaksha) swiftly pierced with pointed shafts resembling fire raging at the time of dissolution and struck Angada with arrows known by names, Ksura, Ksurapra, Naracha, Vatsadanta, Silimukha, Karni, Salya, vipada and many sharp arrows. He (Sonitaksha) swiftly pierced with pointed shafts resembling fire raging at the time of dissolution and struck Angada with arrows known by names, Ksura, Ksurapra, Naracha, Vatsadanta, Silimukha, Karni, Salya, vipada and many sharp arrows. Courageous son of Vali, the mighty Angada encountered with vigour and crumbled the formidable bow (of Sonitaksha), his chariot and arrows. Thereupon enraged Sonitaksha, quickly sprang up to the sky at high speed with sword and shield. Mighty Angada springing up at a higher speed grasped his (Sonitaksha) hand and irritated him with a sword making loud noise. Then Angada pierced his sword on the fl at surface of his shoulder diagonally and cut him with his sword. Vali's son, seizing that great sword again and again, roaring to finally terminate the remaining Rakshasas, went forward. Sonitha adorned with golden armlets taking hold of iron mace rushed behind Angada. Then mighty Yupaksha, and Prajaghna for his part in fury assailed mighty Angada's chariot. Angada, the foremost of Vanaras, coming between both Sonitaksha and Prajaghna shone like a full moon between the Visakha stars. Both Mainda and Dwivida (maternal uncles of Angada) took position for the protection of one another facing the enemy. Rakshasas wielding swords and mace, endowed with stupendous strength and of huge body agitated and assailed Vanaras. A momentous war took place between the three Rakshasas (Prajaghna, Yupaksha and Sonitaksha) and Vanara chiefs (Angada, Dwivida and Mainda) that caused horripilation. In the comb at the Vanaras seizing hold of trees hurled violently and mighty Prajaghna with his sword shattered them In that war the Vanaras hurled trees, rocks on chariots and horses and Yupaksha encountered them and tore them. Heroic and courageous Sonitaksha tore the trees hurled by Dwivida and Mainda in midway by his mace and crushed them. Prajaghna taking up a huge sword went forward swiftly and assailed Angada. Then Vanara leader Angada who was endowed with extraordinary strength, seeing Prajaghna of stupendous power coming forward, hit him with Aswakarna tree. Angada hit the shoulder of Prajaghna which held the sword, with his fist. By that blow the sword got broken and dropped down Seeing the pestle shaped sword fallen on the ground, mighty Prajaghna clenched his fist, which was as hard as the thunderbolt. Sonitaksha of extraordinary energy hit at the forehead of highly valiant Angada. For a while Angada was unable to move. Son of Vali, who was full of vigour, on regaining consciousness hit Prajaghna on the head and trunk and made him fall down. Instantly alighting from the chariot, Yupaksha seeing the uncle exhausted and hurt, eyes filled with tears, he wielded the sword. Observing Yupakasha fallen and rushing quickly, furious Dwivida struck him in the bosom with force and caught him Then seeing the brother caught, mighty Sonitaksha struck Dwivida in the bosom by a mace. Dwivida, though mighty reeled and could not move when struck by Sonitaksha. He got up and again and snatched the mace from Sonithaksha. In the meantime, valiant Vanara leader Mainda arrived and struck with his palm on the chest of Yupaksha. In that fight, courageous Sonitaksha and Yupaksha contested with the two monkeys pulling one another violently and throwing intensely. Valiant Dwivida, for his part, tore Sonitaksha on his face with his nails, and quickening his pace threw him on the surface of the ground and bruised him. Vanara leader, Mainda on his part, angrily pierced Yupaksha many times who fell on the ground dead. Then many heroes died, Rakshasa king's army was distressed and went towards where Kumbhakarna's son was fighting. Kumbha quickly restored the confidence of the troops. Then energetic Kumbha seeing the eminent heroes of Rakshasa army struck down, he found a favourable opportunity and drew up an excellent strategy and performed an extremely difficult deed in the battlefield. Kumbha quickly restored the confidence of the troops. Then energetic Kumbha seeing the eminent heroes of Rakshasa army struck down, he found a favourable opportunity and drew up an excellent strategy and performed an extremely difficult deed in the battlefield. He (Kumbha), the foremost wielder of bow, taking up the bow, remaining fully composed released arrows that resembled poisonous serpents capable of tearing the flesh. Those best arrows fixed to the bow were shining like the cloud with flashes of lightning, and like a second bow of Indra. Then he struck Dwivida with a golden shafted arrow that was loosened to kill by stretching the bow till the ear and released. Struck all of a sudden, the foremost Vanara (Dwivida) alarmed, fell with legs, outstretched, trembling. Seeing the brother shattered in the great combat, Mainda on his part seizing a huge rock rushed swiftly. The mighty Vanara (Mainda) for his part hurled the rock to crush the Rakshasa. Kumbha attacked him with five sharp arrows and rock got broken. Haughty Kumbha, fixed a charming arrow resembling a venomous serpent and struck at Dwivida's brother. That blow hit the Vanara leader in his private parts, and Mainda lost consciousness and fell down. Seeing the two maternal uncles fallen, Angada, who was endowed with great strength, attacked Kumbha, wielding a bow. Kumbha seeing Angada advancing towards him, with five steel arrows and three shafts pierced him just as an elephant is pierced with lances. Kumbha, a valiant hero pierced Angada continuously with several sharp and pointed arrows decked with gold. Vali's son was not shaken by the strike, showered rain of rocks and trees on his (Kumbha) forehead. Prosperous Kumbhakarna's son also shattered the rocks hurled on him, breaking them. Kumbha observing the Vanara leader coming towards him attacked him with fire sticks and pierced his eyebrows. Blood flowed from his injured eyes and his eyes got veiled by blood. Covering his eyes with one hand he took hold of a Sal tree nearby. Compressing the trunk of the tree on the chest with one hand and bending forward a little its branches with another hand, he (Angada) tore Kumbha in that way in the great fight like an elephant. All the Rakshasas seeing the tall tree, which was like Mandara mountain, resembling Indra's banner hurriedly was about to let loose. Kumbha shattered Angada with seven sharp arrows capable of tearing the body. Angada, pained by that screamed and lost his senses. Seeing the foremost Vanara, Angada who was difficult to encounter fell and like sinking into the ocean of despondency, the foremost Vanaras submitted to Rama. On hearing that Angada was tormented in the battlefield and pained he ordered Jambavan and the best of monkey leaders to help him. On hearing Rama's command, the enraged Vanara tigers took up bows to attack Kumbha. Bulls among Vanaras then took trees, and rocks in hand, with their eyes red in anger started for the protection of Angada. Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarsi and other heroic Vanaras, full of anger also rushed to assail Kumbhakarna's son. Perceiving that great army of Vanara leaders are advancing, Kumbha obstructed them with a volley of arrows just like a mountain obstructing the path of torrent. The Vanara leaders could not bear the range of arrows of Kumbhaka, just as a tide can't overstep the shore of an ocean. Seeing the Vanara army pained by the rain of arrows, Sugriva, the Lord of Vanaras having Angada in his rear, swiftly rushed and assailed Kumbhakarna's son just like a lion roaming in the mountains attacks elephants. Seeing the Vanara army pained by the rain of arrows, Sugriva, the Lord of Vanaras having Angada in his rear, swiftly rushed and assailed Kumbhakarna's son just like a lion roaming in the mountains attacks elephants. Mighty strong he was, uprooting Aswakarna and many other several kinds of trees he hurled at them (Rakshasas). Frenzied Kumbhakarna's son was torn under the shower of trees that covered space with sharp arrows which was difficult to approach. The sharp arrows aimed at the target by Kumbha covered the trees and they shone like dreadful Sataghnis. Valiant hero, the prosperous and noble Sugriva, the chief of Vanaras did not get distressed when tormented with rain of trees. He snatched the bow of Kumbha forcibly which was like Indra's rainbow, pulled it and broke, while tolerating the pain of the arrows. Then Sugriva leapt into the chariot, which was a difficult deed to perform, saw Kumbha who was like an elephant and whose tusks were broken and spoke. \"Oh, elder brother of Nikumbha! Your valour, speed of your arrows, compliance, and glory is wonderful like that of Ravana's.\" \"You are equal to Prahlada, Bali, Indra, Kubera and Varuna in might. You alone have taken over like your father.\" \"Oh! mightyarmed, Kumbha! wielding pike in hand, you are a tamer of enemies, you alone are the one that gods are not able to overcome, a pre eminent one who has gained over senses, highly intelligent, exhibiting your prowess and deeds before me.\" \"Oh! mightyarmed, Kumbha! wielding pike in hand, you are a tamer of enemies, you alone are the one that gods are not able to overcome, a pre eminent one who has gained over senses, highly intelligent, exhibiting your prowess and deeds before me.\" \"Your uncle Ravana is able to withstand the Devas and Danavas by virtue of the boons and Kumbhakarna was able to with stand gods and demons by virtue of his courage.\" Thereafter Kumbha held Sugriva's shoulders. They were like two intoxicated elephants holding one another's limbs and rubbing each other and breathing heavily. In exertion they let out from their face fire mixed with smoke. \"Just as the wonderful conflict between Indra and Sambara let the beings witness the mighty comb at between me and you.\" \"By an unequal deed done by you in the efficiency in the use of weapons has been exhibited. The monkey heroes of terrific valour have been made to fall.\" \"O Stalwart! You have not been finished by me for the fear of reproaching. You are exhausted by your deeds and resting. Having rested, witness my strength now.\" Sugriva's words of flattering royalty captivated Kumbha's fire of energy, which doubled like fire fed with ghee. Sugriva's words of flattering royalty captivated Kumbha's fire of energy, which doubled like fire fed with ghee. Sugriva's words of flattering royalty captivated Kumbha's fire of energy, which doubled like fire fed with ghee. Then by the trampling of their feet the earth sank down, the abode of Varuna (ocean) was agitated with rolling waves. Then Sugriva lifted Kumbha and threw him into the ocean quickly, to show him the bottom. By Kumbha falling into the ocean, it got swollen to the form of Vindhya and Mandara mountain and water flowed all over. Then Kumbha hit Sugriva in anger with his fist at the speed of a thunderbolt on his chest. The armour of Sugriva slit open, and blood flowed at high speed and excessively. The first hit of Kumbha hit the skeletal framework of Sugriva in return. Then by the speed of the hit on Sugriva's chest by Kumbha's fist a flame burst forth like the flame of Meru Mountain. Then mighty Sugriva, the bull among Vanaras, hit by the fist, clenched his fist adamantly. Sugriva, the champion pressed his first which shone like the Sun encircled with rays on the chest of Kumbha. By the blow of Sugriva, that Kumbha was pained severely and overcome by fear he fell like fire which has lost its glow. Struck by the fist of Sugriva, the Rakshasa fell just as the glowing planet endowed with brightness accidentally fell from the sky. Struck in the chest by Sugriva's fist, Kumbha fell down and shone like the Sun god over powered by Rudra",
                "Seeing his brother struck down by Sugriva, Nikumbha gazed at him as if to burn him in wrath. Then the hero Nikumbha, girded with flowers measuring five digits in breadth, took an auspicious club like the peak of Mahendra mountain. It was decked with a gold band, encrusted with diamonds and corals, in the form of Yama's rod, a fierce one which dispelled fear. The club was highly splendorous and of terrific strength with the banner of Indra and Nikumbha took that club roared opening his mouth wide and pierced it with force. Nikumbha was shining with ornaments on his chest, golden armlets on arms, wonderful earrings and wonderful garland s holding clubs in hand, with bow like Indra's and roaring like lightning and thunder in the clouds. Nikumbha was shining with ornaments on his chest, golden armlets on arms, wonderful earrings and wonderful garland s holding clubs in hand, with bow like Indra's and roaring like lightning and thunder in the clouds. By Nikumbha whirling around the club and the conjunction of the seven winds coming in contact with the club in his hand crashed in space and glowed like a smokeless fire burst forth. The heaven with the city of Vitapavati, including the excellent abodes of Gandharvas, the hosts of stars and mansions, the lunar abodes along with other planet abodes revolved round as though it was caused by the spinning of Nikumbha's club. The glow of the club, the ornaments, and the fire of Nikumbha that burst forth was like the fire at the time of dissolution of the universe. It was formidable for the Vanaras to reflect on. The Rakshasas and even Vanaras were not able to move out of fear. Only mighty Hanuman stood there showing his chest. The Rakshasa, whose arms were like iron bars and shining like the Sun brought it down on the breast of mighty Hanuman. As soon as the iron club touched the broad chest (of Hanuman), it split into a hundred splinters, in the sky and crumbled. The great Vanara did not move and remained steady like a mountain in an earthquake with the iron club touching him. Struck by the Rakshasa, Hanuman, the foremost of the monkeys of extraordinary strength clenched his fist violently. Highly energetic champion endowed with speed, close to wind god in valour raising his fist instantly crushed Nikumbha on the chest. Then Nikumbha's skin split, and blood started flowing, which appeared as though lightning had risen in the cloud. By that blow, Nikumbha was not moved. Recovering from that he caught hold of Hanuman of extraordinary strength. Then seeing Hanuman endowed with might, lifted by Nikumbha in the battlefield the residents of Lanka roared terribly. Even while being carried by Rakshasa also, the son of the wind god hit Kumbhakarna's son with his hard adamant fist. Hanuman, the son of wind god getting himself released from Nikumbha, springing up standing on the ground tormented Nikumbha. Throwing down Nikumbha with great effort, Hanuman endowed with speed sprang up and fell on his chest. Taking hold of the neck with both arms and twisting it round Hanuman broke off the neck of Nikumbha while he was crying terribly. And thereafter as Nikumbha killed by windgod's son was crying aloud in the battlefield, a violent and fierce war took place between the highly disturbed son of Dasharatha and Rakshasa Makara.",
                "On hearing that Nikumbha and Kumbha had been killed, Ravana was very furious and burning in anger. The Rakshasa king was overtaken by both anger and sorrow, bewildered excessively sent for broadeyed Makara, the son of Khara. \"Son! commanded by me, you go accompanied by arm and kill the Vanaras, Raghava and Lakshmana aslo, Rejoicing to hear the words of Ravana, proclaiming himself to be a hero, Maka raksha, the son of Khara said 'good'. Greeting the tenheaded Rakshasa and going round him according to tradition, the mighty warrior went out from the abode early morning by the command of Ravana. Khara's son spoke to the commanderinchief of the army standing nearby 'Let the chariot be brought quickly and the army proceed'. Upon hearing those words, the commanderinchief of the Rakshasas responded and placed the army near him. After having gone round the chariot he (Makara) ascended and said to the charioteer, 'let the chariot be driven quickly'. Thereafter, Maka raksha spoke to all Rakshasas, 'All of you be ahead of me and fight violently'. \"I will kill both Rama and Lakshmana in the battle, by the order of Ravana, the king of Rakshasas.\" \"Now I shall put an end to Rama and Lakshmana, Sugriva and the Vanaras with the best of arrows.\" \"Going there now, I will terminate the great Vanara army with these pikes just as drywood is burnt by fire.\" On hearing Maka raksha's words all the mighty Rakshasas came with different kinds of weapons. Those who could change their form at will, cruel, with protruding teeth, yellow eyes, dishevelled hair, of frightful appearance, huge like elephants surrounding the son of Khara went joyously forward shaking the earth. Those who could change their form at will, cruel, with protruding teeth, yellow eyes, dishevelled hair, of frightful appearance, huge like elephants surrounding the son of Khara went joyously forward shaking the earth. There was a beating of drums, blowing of thousands of conchs, clapping of arms and great sound was heard. There, the long whip dropped from the charioteer's hand and the Rakshasa's standard had fallen suddenly by divine will. His horses yoked to the chariot went giving up their valour, faltering feet, desperate and shedding tears. At the departure of evil minded and angry Maka raksha, dreadful and violent wind blew carrying with crumbling dust. Seeing those portents incidentally and not taking into account those Rakshasas went where Rama and Lakshmana were.",
                "On seeing Maka raksha all the Vanara chiefs returned, jumped, and stood ready enthusiastically to fight. Then ensued a battle between Rakshasas and Vanaras whichcaused horripilation, just like the battle between Devas and Danavas. Then monkeys as well as Rakshasas fought hurling trees and pikes and bringing down rocks and clubs physically hurting each other. Those prowlers, then ight rangers discharging javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, small swords, bhindi Palas, shafts, nooses, mallets and staff and other weapons on the lions among the monkeys, caused destruction. Those prowlers, then ight rangers discharging javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, small swords, bhindi Palas, shafts, nooses, mallets and staff and other weapons on the lions among the monkeys, caused destruction. Vanaras perturbed terribly by the volley of arrows of Khara's son were stricken with fear and ran. The monkeys saw all the arrogant Rakshasas roaring like lions and running as though triumphed. Thereafter, seeing the Vanaras running all over, Rama stopped the Rakshasas by rain of arrows. Seeing the intercepted Rakshasas, the night ranger Maka raksha was overtaken by fire of anger spoke these words. \"Rama Stop. Duel will take place with me. I will give you sharpened arrows from my bow and relieve you of your life.\" \"Then in Dandakaranya my father was killed. Now for the samereason you are in front of me. Seeing you my anger is increasing.\" \"O Evil minded Raghava! at that time, I did not see you in D and aka forest. My limbs are burning in anger.\" \"Rama! To my good fortune it became possible for me to see you here. Just as a hungry lion waits for an animal, I am waiting for you.\" \"Now by the speed of my arrow I will send you totherealm of Yama and there you will be along with the demons killed by you.\" \"Rama, why talk so much? Listen to my words. Let people in all worldssee you and me in the battlefield.\" \"By weapons, or by mace or else with hand s or any other weapon or with your military practice, you fight, he said to Rama.\" Laughing at the words of Maka raksha who was speaking again and again Rama said. \"Rakshasa! Why so much of wasteful talk about What you can't accomplish? Victory is not possible on the battlefield with your force of speech\" \"In Dandaka, fourteen thousand Rakshasas, your father, Trisira, and also Dooshana were killed by me alone.\" \"O Sinner! Today vultures, jackals and crows with sharp beaks and goads like claws will also be satiated with your flesh.\" Spoken in that manner by Raghava in the battlefield, Maka raksha, endowed with extraordinary strength, released a volley of arrows on Rama. Rama rained volley of arrows on the Rakshasa and shattered those golden feathered arrows which fell on the ground into thousands of pieces. On meeting one another between Khara's son and Dasharatha's son a fierce comb at happened. Then the sound released by the friction of the bowstring and the hand (of the two heroes) filled the sky like thunder of clouds. Devas, Danavas, Ghand arvas, Kinnaras and huge serpents all of them stood in space to look at the wonderful evil deed. Even though they were piercing one another with limbs, their strength remained doubled in the battlefield. Each of them was countering the other and inflicting and hitting each other. In the comb at Rakshasa split the arrows released by Rama and Rakshasa shattered the arrows released by Rama. All quarters were covered by the arrows in that manner all over and even the intermediate point, the earth could not be seen. Then broad shouldered Raghava was enraged and split the bow with eight steel arrows and the charioteer also. Rama broke the chariot, killed the horses, and laid down the night ranger Maka raksha. Deprived of the chariot he stood on the ground. Standing on the ground that Rakshasa who created fear among all beings shone like fire at the time of dissolution of the universe, seized his pike in hand. Seeing that pike, which was glowing like flame, by which the quarters were glowing brightly in the sky like the flame, which had been given by Rudra, which caused fear like another weapon of destruction, all gods fled in panic in all directions. The night ranger whirling round and round the glowing pike furiously hurled at Raghava in that conflict. Raghava split with his three arrows the burning pike released from the hand of Khara's son while it was still flying in the sky. That pike, which was decorated with gold, broke into pieces, and fell down like fire sticks by the many supreme arrows of Rama. Seeing the unwearied action of Raghava in destroying the pike, the beings in the sky praised him saying,\" well done, well done.\" The night ranger Makaraksha seeing his pike destroyed lifting up his fist said this to Kakuthsa, \"Wait, wait.\" Then Rama the beloved of Raghus, laughing at Maka raksha, fixed missile presided by fire god. Then struck in the battlefield by that missile of Kakuthsa, the Rakshasa fell down with his heart split open and died. Seeing Maka raksha fall, those Rakshasas became scared of Rama's arrow and ran straight to Lanka.",
                "Ravana, who was always victorious in warhearing that Maka raksha had been killed, became highly enraged and grinding his teeth in anger was engrossed in thinking. He commanded his son Indrajith to go to battle. Ravana, who was always victorious in warhearing that Maka raksha had been killed, became highly enraged and grinding his teeth in anger was engrossed in thinking. He commanded his son Indrajith to go to battle. \"Oh, Valiant son! You destroy the two heroic brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, by being visible or invisible as you are always superior to them.\" \"You have won the battle with Indra of incomparable deeds. Why not kill men, onseeing them in combat?\" Hearing the words spoken by the Lord of Rakshasas, Indrajith respecting the command poured oblations in the fireas per tradition before proceeding. Thereafter, as he went to the place of fire sacrifice, Rakshasa women brought red coloured head dresses to wear (for the priests). Then, in that fire sacrifice, weapons as grass, wooden pieces as sticks for offering into fire, redcoloured clothes for the priests to wear, and so also iron containers as ladles to offer in fire were used. Weapons were spread on all sides of the fire sacrifice like grass. A darkcoloured live goat's neck was consigned for offering into fire. By that action of fire sacrifice, the mighty flames and the smoke that appeared from the mighty smokeless fire signifying victory appeared. The flames of fire going round the fire by itself which closely resembled refined gold, received the offerings into fire. Having offered fire that way, and gratified Devas, Danavas and Rakshasas, he (Indrajith) ascended the best of chariots and disappeared. Drawn by horses, fitted with sharp mighty bows, the chariot was shining exquisitely and looked charming. The chariot was glittering incarnated with gold covered with images offull moon, crescent moon inscriptions and decorated with images of antelopes. Like flaming fire in appearance, the chariot was provided with rings of gold, the standard of the chariot was adorned with gems of Vydurya. Protected by the weapon of Brahma, effulgent as the orbit of the Sun, the son of Ravana was endowed with mighty prowess and was difficult to gain over. Indrajith who had acquired the power of being victorious in the wars departed, after uttering ritualistic verses which are known to Rakshasas only and making an offering into fire disappeared and bragged as follows. \"Having put an end to war, and the two princes who are in exile in the forest in vain, I will present the victory earned to my father now.\" 'Making the earth devoid of monkeys, killing Rama and Lakshmana, I will provide supreme joy to my father now', saying so he became invisible. Directed by the ten headed Ravana, enemy of Indra, equipped with sharp bows Indrajith rushed furiously. That great hero saw Rama and Lakshmana like three serpents in the midst of Vanaras raining network of arrows. Recognising the two princes, stringing his bow, and fastening, affixing he showered a continuous flow of arrows like rain from rain clouds and covered them. Riding in the aerial car, Indrajith remaining out of sight released pointed arrows from the sky and tormented Rama and Lakshmana standing in the battlefield. Covered by the speed of the arrows released on them, both Rama and Lakshmana wielding their bows and arrows discharged wonderful arrows and exhibited their power. Though the mighty Rama and Lakshmana were covering the sky with their arrows resembling the sun they could not touch Indrajith. The glorious Indrajith obscured the sky by making it dark through smoke and fog and made the surrounding directions invisible. While Indrajith was moving, neither the sounds produced by palms or of the wheels or the hoof s were heard and the form was also not visible., The mighty armed Indrajith showered rocks and hails of steel arrows in that pitch darkness like the darkness of clouds. In that conflict, the enraged son of Ravana, pierced all over Rama's limbs, with arrows bestowed to him, which were as effulgent as the Sun. The tigers among humans, Rama, and Lakshmana, like two mountains hit by steel arrows, released sharp pointedgold shafted steel arrows and tormented (Indrajith). The arrows fixed with swords like wings, reaching Ravana's son in the sky pierced him and he fell down soaked in blood. Brightened by the mass of arrows on their body, the best of men, Rama and Lakshmana began to tear the numerous arrows called Bhallas. Both the sons of Dasharatha, directed their best weapons in the direction from where arrows were falling on two of them. The son of Ravana who was a superior chariot warrior and swift in discharging arrows coursed through all directions and pierced arrows at Rama and Lakshmana from the aerial car. Both the sons of Dasharatha looked like fully blossomed Kimsuka trees (blood flowing from the body) pierced by wellmade gold shafted arrows. When the clouds are cast thickly, except the position of the Sun, nothing is visible. So also, with a swift movement of Indrajith, neither his form nor his bow and arrows were visible. Then, monkeys struck and killed, lifelessin hundreds fell on the ground. Then Lakshmana also, enraged, spoke to his brother, saying,\" I will kill all the Rakshasas using the weapon of Brahma.\" To Lakshmana, gifted with auspicious signs, Rama said\" for the sake of killing one Rakshasa, you are not to kill all the Rakshasas on the earth.\" \"You should not kill anyone who is not waging war, not fighting and hidden, one with folded palms surrendered, one who runs away from war and not alert in war\" \"O mighty armed Lakshmana! I will make an effort to kill Indrajith by commanding weapons like venomous serpents endowed with high speed.\" \" A conjurer, mean, and invisible Indrajith with the chariot, if seen, in any way the Vanara troops will forcibly kill him with their strength.\" \"If he enters into earth, heaven or the underground world or the subterranean world or remains hidden, my weapon will consume him, and he will fall on earth.\"",
                "Knowing the highsouled Raghava's mind, Indrajith departed from there and entered the city. Recollecting those Rakshasas killed, the heroic, mighty and courageous Indrajith's eyes were red in anger. Paulastya (one of the nine mind born sons of Brahma, a scion of sage Paulastya), stupendous hero, a tormentor of Devatas, Indrajith, surrounded by Rakshasas came out through the western gate. Indrajith, also witnessing the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana prepared for war, exhibited his trickery. Indrajith, also through a trick, wanted to make illusory Sita and place her in the chariot surrounded by Rakshasas and thought of killing her. Evil minded Indrajith, made up his mind to hoodwink every one who decided to kill Sita and went towards the Vanaras. All the forest animals perceiving Indrajithadvancing became angry and with rocks in hand faced him with enthusiasm. Hanuman, the elephant among monkeys, taking hold of a huge mountain peak that was difficult to reach marched forward and went. Hanuman beheld in the chariot of Indrajith, cheerless Sita with one braid, with no desire to live, emaciated by fasting, wearing a single cloth, body not anointed, covered with dust and dirt all over the body, who was dear to Raghava. Hanuman beheld in the chariot of Indrajith, cheerless Sita with one braid, with no desire to live, emaciated by fasting, wearing a single cloth, body not anointed, covered with dust and dirt all over the body, who was dear to Raghava. He looked at her for a moment and recognised her as Janaka's daughter since he had seen her not long before. Great Vanara, Hanuman, gazing at miserable, joyless, ascetic woman seated in the chariot, worried, why she is in the chariot. He spoke to the best of Vanara leaders and rushed towards the son of Ravana with them. Great Vanara, Hanuman, gazing at miserable, joyless, ascetic woman seated in the chariot, worried, why she is in the chariot. He spoke to the best of Vanara leaders and rushed towards the son of Ravana with them. Indrajith saw the Vanara army coming towards him, deluded with anger, unsheathed the sword and touched Sita's forehead. As they were looking at Sita on the chariot trickishly constructed, and she was crying saying, 'O Rama, O Rama', he stood and hit her. Seeing Indrajith holding Sita's head, Maruti's son, was immersed in grief, and shed tears of sorrow from his eyes. Looking at Rama's dear wife, of lovely limbs, Hanuman rebuked Indrajith in anger and spoke harsh words. \"O evil minded Indrajith! You are born as Rakshasa in the clan of seers of vedic mantras and sought the womb of Rakshasa woman. It is for your own self destruction you seized her hair. \"You are ignoble, mean, of sinful prowess, not merciful. You have resolved to take such a sinful action which is not worthy of you. You have no compassion to act in this manner.\" \"This Mythili is sent away from home, from the kingdom, and also distanced from Rama's protection. You are unkind and hitting in this way. What harm has she done?\" \"Indeed, you will not live long after killing Sita. You deserve to be killed for your actions, that is why you have come into my hands.\" \"You deserve to be killed by the world here. Giving up your life, you will be thrown out and descend to the world with those who killed women have gone, after your death.\" Hanuman was highly enraged and speaking like got prepared for war and went surrounded by the monkeys towards Indrajith, the son of Rakshasa king. Rakshasa army troops of mighty prowess, terribly angry, were advancing towards wood dwellers (Vanara troops) and were intercepted by the Vanara troops. Indrajith shattered the army of monkeys with a thousand arrows. Hanuman the foremost Vanara replied to them as follows. \"I will kill your Vaidehi today as you keep seeing her for whose sake Sugriva, you and Rama also came here,\" said Indrajith. \"O Vanara! This day, having killed her, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, and you, also Sugriva and that ignoble Vibheeshana.\" \"O Hanuman! You said women should not be killed. But whoever causes trouble to the enemy, action should be taken, said Indrajith.\" Indrajith having spoken like that killed that crying illusory Sita with a sharpedged sword. Split diagonally, the ascetic woman with charming hips and pleasing countenance sank into the ground. Indrajith killed that woman and said to Hanuman\" see this Vaidehi, Rama's wife, cut up by my sword. Your exertion is useless now.\" Indrajith killed that woman and said to Hanuman\" see this Vaidehi, Rama's wife, cut up by my sword. Your exertion is useless now.\" Indrajith himself with his long sword killed her, then rejoiced, he ascended the chariot and roared in a loud tone. The sound of his roar was heard by the Vanaras waiting for war standing not far from there, which was difficult for Indrajith to access.",
                "The bulls among Vanaras heard the roar which was like thunder and looking at Indrajith fled in all directions. Thereafter, Maruti's son, Hanuman said to all Vanaras who were looking sad, piteous, feeling singly out of fear, and running away. \"O monkeys! Why have you lost enthusiasm to fight, looking sad and running away? Where has your valour gone?\" \"Return and come in front, close to me and follow me. It is not proper for you to win wars and be praised.\" Wise son of wind god having spoken in that way, delighted in mind the Vanaras seized peaks of mountains and also trees in great fury. Surrounding Hanuman, the Vanara leaders followed him for a great fight. Hanuman went surrounded by Vanara leaders who resembled flaming fire and began to consume the enemy troops like flaming fire. The Vanara army surrounded that great monkey, Hanuman, who was like Yama, the god of death and caused havoc to Rakshasas. Hanuman, overtaken by anger, filled with great sorrow hurled a huge rock at the chariot of Ravana's son. Then seeing that rock coming towards the chariot yoked to obedient horses, the chariot rider drove it to a long distance. That rock hurled by Hanuman failed to reach the chariot in which Indrajith was seated and also the charioteer. It cleaved the earth and entered. As the rock fell on the battlefield the Rakshasa troops got alarmed and were violently crushed to death. Those gigantic forest dwellers in hundreds seizing trees and rocks lifted and fought making loud noise. Courageous Vanaras, innumerable in number began to rain trees and rocks throwing on the enemies. The Rakshasas number rolled on the battlefield shouting in numerous tones. Night rangers of dreadful appearance beaten up with trees by most fierce Vanaras, fell on the battlefield and struck one another. Indrajith, looking at his own army tormented by the Vanaras, was enraged, and went towards the enemies' seizing weapons. Indrajith of unyielding valour, combining with his own army let go numerous arrows on the tigers of Vanaras and struck them. In the battle, followers of Indrajith struck the Vanaras with tridents, asanis, swords, sharp edged spears, and kutamudgaras. Hanuman, who was endowed with great strength, killed Rakshasas capable of terrific tasks with trees having large trunks and branches and stones also. Hanuman made the enemy army retreat, and spoke to his own army,\" No use of defeating this army for us as our mission is not winning the army.\" \"To please Rama, we are giving up life. Let us make Rama know that the daughter of Janaka for whose sake we are fighting this war and giving up life has been killed.\" \"On telling this fact (that Indrajith has killed Sita) to Rama and Sugriva and knowing their reply we will do what is to be done.\" The foremost of the Vanaras, kept back all the Vanaras after speaking that way to the army and slowly and slowly retreated. Thereafter, observing Hanuman going to Raghava, the evil minded Indrajith went to Nikumbhilam desiring to offer oblations at the sanctuary. Indrajith reaching Nikumbhilam, the sacrificial ground, poured oblation of blood into the sacrificial fire for Devatas and the fire blazed. Indrajith reaching Nikumbhilam, the sacrificial ground, poured oblation of blood into the sacrificial fire for Devatas and the fire blazed. The flame had swollen up with the offering of blood as oblation and risen. It was very bright and wrapped in the flames the fire resembled the sun.",
                "Hearing the great noise of war between Rakshasas and Vanaras, Rama said to Jambavantha. \"O gentle Jambavan! The terrifying sound of weapons is heard. Surely Hanuman has done a difficult task.\" \"O King of Bears! Accompanied by your army, go to the battlefield and help the best of monkeys.\" Rama having spoken thus, King of Bears surrounded by Vanaras went to Hanuman at the western gate. Then the Lord of Bears saw Hanuman accompanied by Vanaras who fought in war coming sighing. Hanuman seeing the terrific army of Bears marching like a dark cloud asked them to return and he also returned with them. Hanuman of great fame accompanied by army quickly came to Rama and submitted as follows. \"Ravana's son, Indrajith struck Sita, who was crying in front of us looking at us while we were fighting in war.\" \"O Tamer of enemies! Seeing her (Sita) bewildered in mind, worried, I have come to inform you accompanied by Vanaras.\" On hearing, Hanuman's words Raghava became deluded in sorrow and fell on the ground like a tree cut at the root. Seeing Raghava who is equal to god fallen on the ground, and the best of monkeys lifting him, the Vanaras from all over came jumping. Reaching Rama, who was like a burning fire that has risen up and suddenly fallen, the Vanaras sprinkled water with fragrance of lotuses and lilies on Rama just as sprinkling water on an inextinguishable fire that has flared up suddenly. Then, Lakshmana who was very worried held the arms of Rama who was unwell and spoke these meaningful words. \"O Noble Rama! If You, who have gained over senses and sticking to a virtuous path are not protected, from this calamity by righteousness, then righteousness is useless.\" \" As animate and inanimate beings are seen experiencing joy at present, righteousness is not the cause of joy, I think so.\" \"Just as inanimate beings which are seen happy and animate are also seen in the same manner, in which case that righteousness alone prospers is not there (for a person like you would not suffer). Knowing this you should not suffer.\" \"If there is unrighteousness, Ravana should be in hell. You who are endowed with righteousness should not have agony.\" \" As Ravana has no sorrow and you have experienced agony the contraries of each other have changed the roles of righteousness and unrighteousness.\" \"The righteous attains the benefit through righteous means, and the unrighteous suffer by unrighteous means. If unrighteousness is rooted in the unrighteous and are pleased with unrighteousness they will be deprived of the result of righteousness. It is not otherwise.\" \"The righteous attains the benefit through righteous means, and the unrighteous suffer by unrighteous means. If unrighteousness is rooted in the unrighteous and are pleased with unrighteousness they will be deprived of the result of righteousness. It is not otherwise.\" \"Since those rooted in unrighteous develop and are wealthy, and those who follow dharma suffer both these are meaningless.\" \"Righteousness and unrighteousness are forms of actions, sinful or not sinful. If sinful action is unrighteous, those who have done sinful actions should suffer. Since sinful action is momentary, and as soon as the action is over unrighteousness is also gone. That being so how can unrighteousness cause pain to anyone?\" \"Or else if a man is destroyed by killing another, destiny which is engendered by the sinful action suffers and not the doer of sinful action.\" \"O Crusher of enemies! How does righteousness get encountered? It is not seen. How to know whether it is real or unreal? Is it possible to know that the best result is attained by righteousness.\" \"O foremost among the victorious! To you, who are a jewel no evil should accrue. Since such difficulty has been faced by you, the fact that good actions result in good destiny is not true.\" \"Or else dharma becomes feeble, ineffective, submits to might, then it is better not to follow such dharma which is feeble, I think.\" \"Giving up predominance of virtue, seek courage and submit to might for succeeding in action. Seek might just as you have sought dharma earlier for success.\" \"O scorcher of enemies! If you consider speaking the truth is dharma, why did you not bind your father (who promised to give the kingdom) and was not compassionate (spoke untruth later).\" \"Indra killed an ascetic (Viswarupa) and did fire sacrifice. If dharma alone is his duty, he could have done hundreds of fire sacrifices and not have killed the ascetic. If adharma is duty he would have killed the ascetic and not done fire sacrifice.\" \"Kakuthsa Rama! Kings followed dharma and adharma both according to context. Whether following dharma or adharma destruction is happening. Therefore, humans keep doing both as per their desire.\" \"Dear Raghava! In my opinion also depending on desire and context, following dharma or adharma is proper. You have severed the roots of dharma by giving up the kingdom.\" \"Prosperity is augmented gradually and developed by all means just as rivers flow from mountains, all undertakings follow conducive to success.\" \"Just like streams dry up in summer, if one who is of meagre intelligence and forsakes wealth, all his actions will be interrupted.\" \"If one who has been happy seeks happiness on renouncing wealth then proceeds to perform sinful actions it is a mistake.\" \"Friends gather round him in whom riches abide. Relations stand by him who has wealth. He is considered manly in whom wealth abides, and he is learned who has wealth.\" He is gallant to whom wealth has flown, he is intelligent in whom wealth abides, he is glorious in whom wealth exists and he is superior in great virtues in whom wealth found receptacle. 'If you give up wealth the evils will follow you', said I. Now you left the kingdom. The basis on which you made such a resolve is not known to me. For one who has wealth all his actions of dharma would give pleasure and favourable. One who has no wealth and is worrying about it can't attain it. \"O Rama! Desire, delight, pride, virtue, anger, forgiveness, fortitude all these are effective through wealth.\" \"Even if there is wealth if one renunciates wealth and follows dharma in this world they perish like planets on cloudy days.\" \"O heroic Rama! You have been faithful to the promise to your father and left home following dharma (giving up wealth), and your dear wife who is your life has been abducted by Rakshasa.\" \"Get up, heroic Raghava! I will get rid of the agony caused to you by Indrajith, by the action.\" \"O tiger among men! O broad shouldered endowed with fortitude! Why do you not know yourself that you are a great soul and doer of action?\"",
                "As Lakshmana was comforting his affectionate brother, Vibheeshana came to Rama assigning the troops to reach their respective places. Accompanied by the four ministers surrounded by four ministers resembling leaders of elephants, who looked dark like collyrium, Vibheeshana came to highsouled Rama. He witnessed Vanaras whose eyes were filled with tears. He (Vibheeshana) saw the great soul, the delight of the Ikshvaku race deluded, distressed, and lying on the lap of Lakshmana. He (Vibheeshana) saw the great soul, the delight of the Ikshvaku race deluded, distressed, and lying on the lap of Lakshmana. Vibheeshana was pained to see Rama immersed in grief, depressed in spirit, and asked for What is all this grief for? Lakshmana looking at Sugriva's face and also at the Vanaras, his eyes bathed in tears spoke in a dull tone. \"O Noble one! On hearing Hanuman that Sita is killed by Indrajith, Rama is deluded', said Lakshmana to Vibheeshana.\" Vibheeshana spoke these meaningful words to Rama, who was unconscious, restraining Saumithri from speaking. \"I think that what has been spoken by Hanuman as truth (that Sita has been killed) is like drying up an ocean.\" \"O mighty armed Rama! with reference to Sita, you do not know Ravana's opinion. He will never kill Sita.\"",
                "Immersed in grief, Raghava could not make out the words spoken by Vibheeshana. Then Rama, who can win over enemies, picked up courage, said to Vibheeshana seated near him in front of Vanaras. \"O Lord of Rakshasas, Vibheeshana! I wish to hear the words spoken by you. You may repeat that which you wanted to convey. I wish to hear.\" Vibheeshana, who was skilled in expression, spoke again as follows on hearing Raghava's words. \" After your command the army has been divided and placed at respective places as you said.\" All the army forces have been collected, divided, and assigned to respective places separately. \"O great Lord! Hear me, which is yet to be submitted by me to you. You are afflicted without cause and pained at heart.\" \"O king! Give up this false agony which has set in. It enhances the joy of the enemy. Give up this anxiety.\" \"Let efforts be made to recover Sita. Let enthusiasm be restored to recover Sita. Rakshasas will be exterminated.\" \"Delight of Raghus! You may listen to my words of advice. Let Saumithri march ahead to Nikumbhilam accompanied by the great army. On reaching, let Lakshmana who is capable of killing Indrajith discharge venomous serpents like deadly poisonous arrows from his bow in circular form and kill Rakshasas.\" \"Delight of Raghus! You may listen to my words of advice. Let Saumithri march ahead to Nikumbhilam accompanied by the great army. On reaching, let Lakshmana who is capable of killing Indrajith discharge venomous serpents like deadly poisonous arrows from his bow in circular form and kill Rakshasas.\" \"Lakshmana, being heroic received Brahmasira weapon from the creator by austerity and also horses which can course according to his will.\" \"Indrajith has reached Nikumbhilam accompanied by the army. If he completes the sacrifice and comes from there after completion of the sacrifice, know that we are all killed. \"O mighty armed Rama! that enemy of yours, while you have not reached Nikumbhilam and not propitiated fire sacrifice, can cause your death. Such a boon was granted to him, the enemy of Indra by the Lord of all worlds.\" \"O mighty armed Rama! that enemy of yours, while you have not reached Nikumbhilam and not propitiated fire sacrifice, can cause your death. Such a boon was granted to him, the enemy of Indra by the Lord of all worlds.\" Rama, you are endowed with extraordinary prowess! Order now for the destruction of Indrajith as with his death Ravana and all his kinsfolk are killed, you may know. Hearing Vibheeshana, Rama said\" the conjuring skills of Indrajith of truthful valour is known to me.\" He is skilled in the use of Brahma's weapon, intelligent in conjuring, endowed with mighty prowess, and can make even varuna and Devatas unconscious. When he moves in his chariot in the sky like the Sun coursing through clouds is difficult to know. Knowing the wickedminded enemy of conjuring valour, Rama spoke as follows to Lakshmana, richly endowed with fame (of winning wars). \"O Lakshmana! Surrounded by the entire army of Vanara king, with Hanuman as commander in chief of the army, protected by Jambavan, king of Bears, put an end to the son of Ravana who is well versed in tricks.\" \"O Lakshmana! Surrounded by the entire army of Vanara king, with Hanuman as commander in chief of the army, protected by Jambavan, king of Bears, put an end to the son of Ravana who is well versed in tricks.\" \"This great soul, night ranger (Vibheeshana) who knows his conjuring tricks well, will follow behind you with ministers.\" \"On hearing Raghava's words, Lakshmana of wonderful courage took up the best of bows accompanied by Vbheeshana.\" Saumithri fully equipped with shields, swords, shafts, and golden bow joyfully, touched Rama's feet with reverence and spoke. Now the arrows released from my bow will drop in Lanka, just as swans descend into lotus pond and pierce into Ravana's son. \"Today loosed from my mighty bow, the arrows will split his fierce body and kill him.\" Brilliant Lakshmana, having spoken that way in front of his brother, went speedily desirous of killing Ravana's son. Saluting the feet of the eldest brother and going round him, Laksmana proceeded to Nikumbhila sanctuary ruled by Ravana. Lakshmana, a valourous prince having received blessings from his eldest brother, went quickly accompanied by Vibheeshana. Then Hanuman surrounded by many thousands of Vanaras, Vibheeshana and ministers followed Lakshmana. Lakshmana also saw Jambavan standing on the way, with a huge Vanara army surrounded while going speedily. Lakshmana, the delight of friends, witnessed from a distance the Rakshasa army arranged in battlearray. The tamer of enemies and delight of the Raghu race, Lakshmana stood wielding bow in hand ready to win the conjurer conferred with boon by the creator Brahma. Accompanied by Vibheeshana, and also hero Angada, so also the son of fire god, Hanuman, Lakshmana stood together.",
                "Ravana's brother seeing Lakshmana spoke these words of advice to accomplish the task and which is not good for the enemies. \"The army of Rakshasas looks like a dark cloud and let the monkeys too get engaged to fight swiftly with trees as weapons.\" \"O Lakshmana! Shatter this mighty army of Rakshasas. When it is broken Ravana's son will become visible.\" \"You have come to attack the enemy. Before he completes his action quickly attack him with the thunderbolt of Indra.\" \"Hero, wicked minded, conjurer, unrighteous and cruel one who is a terror for all worlds is Ravana's son. Destroy him.\" Lakshmana, who had auspicious marks, on hearing Vibheeshana rained showers of arrows on Ravana's son. The Bears and monkeys together initiated a fight with the army with trees, mountains, and nails as weapons. The Rakshasas also launched attacks in the battle with sharp swords, javelins, and lances. With both the monkeys and Rakshasas mutually striking intensely, the mighty sounds resounded all over Lanka The sky was covered with weapons of various shapes, arrows, trees, mountain peaks thrown at each other and were dreadful. The Rakshasas with disfigured faces and arms, attacked the Vanaras, and their bodies pierced with weapons created great fear in them. The monkeys likewise wounded and assailed the bulls among Rakshasas with trees and mountain peaks in the battle. Mighty Bears and Vanaras of huge body, fighting in the battle caused great fear in Rakshasas. Indrajith, who is difficult to overpower, on hearing the cries of his own army in agony got up without completing the task (of ritual). Enraged, Indrajith coming out of the darkness of trees ascended the chariot already yoked and fixed firmly. Indrajith, armed with a terrific bow and arrows, his body shining like a rainy cloud, with red eyes, angry face, seemed like the spirit of death. Seeing Lakshmana prepared for war, the Rakshasa army endowed with speed surrounded him. In the meantime, Hanuman, who resembled a mountain, a tamer of enemies, who is difficult to overpower, taking up huge trees fighting with Rakshasas created havoc like fire at the time of dissolution and went about. In the meantime, Hanuman, who resembled a mountain, a tamer of enemies, who is difficult to overpower, taking up huge trees fighting with Rakshasas created havoc like fire at the time of dissolution and went about. Seeing the wind god's son destroying, thousands of Rakshasas got together surrounding him. Between the skilful Rakshasas armed with sharp tridents, swords, javelins in hand, with spears in hand, bright iron bars glowing like fire, with iron axes, dreadful hammers, Bhindi palas and Hanuman, with thunderbolt like fists that descended like lightning, and slaps which descended like mountains, a huge skillful war took place.

Indrajith witnessed Hanuman, the foremost of Vanaras without weapons, fearlessly fighting. Thus Indrajith spoke to the charioteer \"This Vanara will no doubt reduce the Rakshasa army if we keep waiting.\" On hearing Indrajith who is highly difficult to encounter speaking in that way his charioteer drove Indrajith, to that place, where Maruthi was. Going near Hanuman, that dreadful Rakshasa, rained arrows, spears, swords and iron bars on the face of Hanuman. Receiving those frightening weapons, Maruthi spoke these words overcome by anger. \"Evil minded hero! Fight with me back having met, you shall not return alive.\" \"Fight with me for a duel war if you like. Come quickly and with stand, then you will become foremost among Rakshasas. \"Vibheeshana told Lakshmana that Indarjith having seated is ready to attack Hanuman.\" \"Ravana's son, the conqueror of Indra, having taken a se at in the chariot seeks to kill Hanuman.\" \"O Saumithri! Kill that son of Ravana with your formidable weapons of incomparable craftsmanship, dreadful arrows capable of killing enemies.\"",
                "Vibheeshana, having spoken that way, Saumithri was satisfied. Wielding a bow Saumithri went quickly with Vibheeshana. Thereafter Vibheeshana followed Lakshmana for a small distance to the forest and showed him What to do. Vibheeshana, the brilliant brother of Ravana, showed Lakshmana a banyan tree resembling a dark cloud, frightening to look at. \"Mighty son of Ravana having offered oblations for all beings he comes to the battlefield. (Said Vibheeshana)\" \"Thereafter he becomes invisible for all beings and kills his enemies with the best of arrows and binds them.\" \"Before he enters the banyan tree, you destroy Indrajith, with his chariot, horses and charioteer by the flaming arrows\" Brilliant Saumithri, delighted by his friends, twanging his wonderful bow stood there, after Vibheeshana had spoken to him. Indrajith, who was endowed with mighty prowess, armed with shield and sword, appeared like glowing gold in the chariot decorated with a post. Lakshmana of extraordinary energy, spoke to Indrajith of the Paulastya clan,\" I challenge you to fight in battle directly. Fight with me.\" Having spoken that way, highly energetic and strong minded Indrajith seeing Vibheeshana spoke to him harshly as follows. \"O Rakshasa! You are born here and brought up by my father. You are my father'sbrother also. How can you be hostile to your son?\" \"Evil minded Vibheeshana! You are vitiating righteousness, have no value to your race, no affection to your clan, no brotherly feeling and have no righteousness.\" \"You are evil minded, think. You are pitiable and to be blamed for you have abandoned your own people and sought the enemy's protection.\" \"You do not seem to have an understanding of the difference between living with one's own people and seeking refuge from strangers. Your intellect has slackened you are not knowing.\" \"Even if others are virtuous and your own people are not virtuous also one should seek the refuge of one's own people. Strangers are always strangers.\" \"He who renounces his own kind and seeks refuge from others, will be destroyed by others whose refuge he sought when his own people are destroyed.\" \"O Ravana's brother! You have shown ruthlessness this way. O night ranger! Only you could exhibit this kind of manliness.\" Indrajith having spoken like that, Vibheeshana replied,\" why do you speak like that as though you do not know my disposition?\" \"Impious son of Rakshasa king! Though born in the Rakshasa clan I renounced cruel deeds and followed respectfully manliness as my primary quality. My nature is not like that of Rakshasas.\" \"I do not delight in cruel deeds, nor follow unrighteousness. Or else because of unfavourable disposition how can a brother be expelled by a brother?\" \"The association of one who has renounced righteousness and is of sinful deeds is left by a righteous man who undoubtedly attains happiness, is like shaking of a venomous serpent from the hand.\" \"Seizing the property of others, uniting with others wife, evil mindedness is said to be given up like getting out of a burning house.\" \"Stealing the wealth of others, possessing others wife, distrusting friends, these three faults will destroy a person.\" \"Dreadful killing of sages, haughtiness towards deities, irascibility, anger, animosity, refractorinessall these faults will put an end to one's life. These faults have obscured my brother's future just as rainy clouds veil the mountain.\" \"Dreadful killing of sages, haughtiness towards deities, irascibility, anger, animosity, refractorinessall these faults will put an end to one's life. These faults have obscured my brother's future just as rainy clouds veil the mountain.\" \"Because of these faults your father and my brother has been abandoned by me from this Lanka. This Lanka will not be there, nor your father and you too.\" \"O Rakshasa! You are mean, proud of might, immoral and bound by the noose of death. Whatever you wish to say you may say.\" \"O Lowly Rakshasa! This worry has come to you today. Entering the banyan tree is not possible for you today.\" \"Clashing with Lakshmana of Kakuthsa clan is not possible for you. By waging war with Lakshmana, you will be killed and reaching the abode of the Lord of death. You will be doing tasks of deities of Devatas.\"",
                "Hearing Vibheeshana's words, Indrajith was deluded with fury, spoke harshly and advanced. Lifting his long, strong huge, great terrific bow endowed with high speed and holding it drawing arrows seated in a chariot well decorated, drawn by black horses, Indrajith looked like God of Death. Lifting his long, strong huge, great terrific bow endowed with high speed and holding it drawing arrows seated in a chariot well decorated, drawn by black horses, Indrajith looked like God of Death. Wielding a bow, seated in a well decorated chariot, mighty destroyer of enemies (Indrajith) saw Raghava's brother. Lakshmana was like the Sun on the eastern mountain mounted on the back of Hanuman, the tiger among Vanaras. He saw Vibheeshana and spoke. \"See my valour and prowess now. I will release shower of arrows from the sky like rain and it will be difficult for others to counter.\" \"Then my arrows delivered from the great bow will pierce the limbs and burn like a bundle of cotton by fire.\" \"Now I will send you to the abode of Yama with sharp arrows, tridents, pikes, spears and lances.\" \"Who can stand in front of me if I release rain of arrows with my swift hand in the battle roaring like a rain cloud?\" \"Earlier in the war at night, by the thunderbolt like arrows released by me on the Earth, you and your accomplice were made unconscious and laid low.\" \"I am like a poisonous serpent, enraged. Is it that you have lost memory, or you stood here on the way to Yama's abode, I think.\" On hearing Indrajith's words, Lakshmana spoke these words in anger with fearless countenance. \"Rakshasa! You have proclaimed that you will send me to Yama's abode and about the success in your undertakings even though it is not possible. He who is intelligent will succeed in his tasks (not in words alone). \"O evil minded one! Your claim, in words that you have the capacity to do which is difficult for others is meaningless. Though you lack the capacity to succeed you are only thinking that you have succeeded.\" \"Remaining invisible and moving in the battle then is the path of a thief which is not chosen by warriors.\" \"Rakshasa! I have reached your range of arrows and stand before you. Show that power now about which you boasted.\" After Lakshmana had spoken that way, Indrajith, endowed with mighty prowess, and victorious in combat seized a terrific bow and released pointed arrows. The shafts like deadly poisonous serpents reached Lakshmana at great speed hissing and fell on Lakshmana. Ravana's son Indrajith, who was endowed with great speed in war, pierced Lakshmana with shafts released at a much higher velocity. With shafts pierced all over, glorious Lakshmana was bathed in blood and shone like smokeless fire. Indrajith observing his own action, approaching Lakshmana, emitted a loud cry and spoke these words. \"Saumithri, these sharp pointed arrows fixed to feathers, which can destroy life, released by me now will put an end to your life.\" \"Lakshmana! Today let the jackals, hawks and vultures descend on your bodystruck down by me and ceased of life fallen dead.\" \"Highly stupid Rama will see you, a devoted brother, a true kshatriya ever ignoble, killed by me today.\" \"Saumithri, he (Rama) will see you struck by me fallen on the ground, shield broken and fallen down, bow thrown down and trunk with severed head.\" When Indrajith was speaking harshly, enraged Lakshmana replied in a meaningful way with reason. \"Evil minded Rakshasa! Give up that wasteful power of speech. You are cruel in action. What is the use of all this now? Show by good deeds and not by talk.\" Rakshasa! What is the use of praising without performing action? Show by action and create trust that you can perform. \"Lowly Rakshasa! without any harsh words, indeed without boasting, commenting, interrupting I will assail you. You may see.\" Having spoken like that, Lakshmana stretching his arrows till the ear fixed five sharp arrows of high speed on the chest of Rakshasa. The arrows being tied to good feathers glowing like serpents shone on the chest of Rakshasa like the rays of Sun. Struck by the arrows, Indrajith in return furiously released three well aimed arrows at Lakshmana. In that combat both Lakshmana and Indrajith pounding to win against each other was frightening. Both were richly endowed with prowess, both were courageous, exceedingly difficult to conquer and peerless in might. In the combat both the heroes fought displaying their might, shone like two planets in the heaven and fought like Indra and Vrta and were difficult to overcome. Then both the great warriors Lakshmana and Indrajith fought discharging many arrows, like lions among humans and Rakshasas respectively, looking out and seeking, dropping, and falling one over the other and stayed joyful.    This is the end of the eighty eighth sarga of Yuddha Kanda of the first epic the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Then Lakshmana, the tamer of enemies, sighs in anger like a serpent, fixing his arrows discharged on Rakshasa king. On hearing the sound of the bow string of Laksmana the Lord of Rakshasa became pale in face and looked at Lakshmana. Seeing Ravana's son, pale faced, Vibheeshana replied as follows to Saumithri who was ready for combat. \"On the basis of the indications of the pale face of Ravana's son, it is clear that he is broken at heart. No doubt about it.\" Then Saumithri fitted his bow with shining arrows that were like tongues of fire, which resembled venomous serpents and discharged. Struck by Indra's thunderbolt like arrows of Lakshmana, all sense organs of Indrajith remained excited for a short while. Heroic son of Ravana gained consciousness in a short while and returning to normalcy saw the heroic son of Dasharatha. He (Indrajith), enraged and eyes turned red, advancing towards Lakshmana, and approaching him again spoke in this way harshly. \"Do you not remember that in the first combat your brother bound by me had fallen on the ground. Why do you not remember my valour?\" \"Formerly in the course of the first battle, the great combat, you two were laid down on ground having lost senses struck by my thunderbolt like arrows and Asani of Indra.\" \"Knowing my valour, you have come. Have you lost memory or do you desire to go to Yama's abode? Tell me.\" \"If you have not seen my courage in the first combat, now I will exhibit. Stand and fight now.\" Having spoken that way, Indrajith pierced Lakshmana with seven pointed shafts and Hanuman with ten best of shafts. Then valiant Rakshasa, doubly angry pierced well targeted hundred arrows at Vibheeshana. Then Lakshmana, the foremost among men, seeing Indrajith not minding his action even a little, laughing said,\" these arrows are not causing even a little pain.\" Then fearless Lakshmana discharged a dreadful arrow at Indrajith. Then Lakshmana, the foremost among men, seeing Indrajith not minding his action even a little, laughing said,\" these arrows are not causing even a little pain.\" Then fearless Lakshmana discharged a dreadful arrow at Indrajith. \"O Night ranger! Heroes coming for war do not strike this way. These arrows are weak, so not painful but conducive.\" \"Heroes seeking victory in that way do not fight\". Thus speaking, Lakshmana rained arrows. Shattered by the arrows, the shield of Indrajith covered with gold dropped in the chariot like a mass of stars from the sky. Indrajith's shield shattered by the iron arrows, (of Lakshmana) in the combat, he seemed (bathed in blood) like the morning Sun. Then enraged Ravana's son endowed with terrific valour pierced Lakshmana with a thousand arrows. Lakshmana's mighty and wonderful shield also got shattered. Both took offense as well as retaliated each other moving swiftly. Wounded all over the body in war and bathed in blood, breathing heavily again and again both of them fought vehemently. Both heroes, being experts in fighting, tore each other with sharp arrows for long. Both of them of terrible valour, each of them wanting to win, moving together their armour and standards torn, started emitting hot blood from their body like waterfalls gushing out. Just as dark clouds rain from the sky at the time of dissolution, the dreadful rain of arrows set free from the bows of both Lakshmana and Indrajith caused terrific sound. Both of them fought for long and did not turn back from the battlefield or experienced any fatigue Just as dark clouds rain from the sky at the time of dissolution, the dreadful rain of arrows set free from the bows of both Lakshmana and Indrajith caused terrific sound. Both of them fought for long and did not turn back from the battlefield or experienced any fatigue Both of them, the best warriors, displaying their weapons again and again looking at the sky covered it with a network of arrows. Both human and Rakshasa warriors fought an exceedingly frightening and dreadful fight over one another with agility without wasting a single arrow. The fierce and tumultuous impact of the sound produced by their palms (clappings) could be heard separately. It was like a violent wind that had shaken. When both of them were thus fighting, the exceedingly frightening sound that was heard was like the murmur of clouds. Glorious and powerful heroes, determined to win over each other, wounded by the gold covered iron arrows were bleeding profusely. In the battle the gold covered arrows fell on their body, dropped out and penetrated into the earth. The other pointed arrows of both clashed with weapons in the sky in thousands, shattered and tore them. In the battle the terrific arrows appeared to the eyes like kusa grass spread by the sacred fire. The wounded bodies of the great heroes, shone like the Kimsuka and Cotton blossoms in the forest, swore off their leaves. Indrajith and Lakshmana again and again carried out tumultuous and dreadful struggle. In the battle Lakshmana and Indrajith striking each other had not experienced fatigue. Great heroes, endowed with speed with a network of arrows pierced on the bodies shone like mountains overgrown with trees. Both of them, bodies wet with blood and covered with arrows were glowing like fire and appeared bright. Even though both, Ravana's son, and Lakshmana, fought for a long time they neither turned away from battle or experienced fatigue.",
                "Lakshmana (man) and Indrajith (Rakshasa) were fond of battle and intending to win in the fight overcoming each other. Each of them were like elephants but were broken into pieces. Vibheeshana, with eagerness to witness the battle stood in the forefront of the battlefield watching the fight. Lakshmana (man) and Indrajith (Rakshasa) were fond of battle and intending to win in the fight overcoming each other. Each of them were like elephants but were broken into pieces. Vibheeshana, with eagerness to witness the battle stood in the forefront of the battlefield watching the fight. Then Vibheeshana stood with stretched bow and loosened sharp pointed arrows on Rakshasas. Those burning arrows falling on Rakshasas touched the Rakshasas and split them like thunderbolt splitting mountains. Followers of Vibheeshana, the foremost of Rakshasa heroes, were shattered by the pikes, swords, and sharpedged spears in the battle. Vibheeshana surrounded by Rakshasas shone like an elephant in the midst of young elephants. Then Vibheeshana, who is a knower of what is the right time to act spoke to Vanaras to embolden them who were eager to fight with Rakshasas. \"Oh Vanara leaders! He (Indrajith) is the only one who is left in the Rakshasa army. Why do you stand idle?\" \"If this wicked Rakshasa is struck down, except Ravana all his army is killed.\" \"The heroic Prahastha, Nikumbha also and Kumbhakarna of mighty prowess, Kumbha also, night ranger Dum raksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Teekshanavega, Asanibhra, Suptanga, Yagnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Rakshasas Simhadri, Arigna, Vikata, Tapana, Dama also, Praghaasa, Praghasa, Prajaghna, and Jaghan also, Durdarsha, Agniketha, heroes Rasmikethu, Vidyajihva, Dwijihwa, Suryasatru, and Rakshasas Akampana, Suparswa, Chakramali, and Rakshasas Kampana, and energetic Devanthaka and Naranthaka have been killed by you.\" \"The heroic Prahastha, Nikumbha also and Kumbhakarna of mighty prowess, Kumbha also, night ranger Dum raksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Teekshanavega, Asanibhra, Suptanga, Yagnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Rakshasas Simhadri, Arigna, Vikata, Tapana, Dama also, Praghaasa, Praghasa, Prajaghna, and Jaghan also, Durdarsha, Agniketha, heroes Rasmikethu, Vidyajihva, Dwijihwa, Suryasatru, and Rakshasas Akampana, Suparswa, Chakramali, and Rakshasas Kampana, and energetic Devanthaka and Naranthaka have been killed by you.\" \"The heroic Prahastha, Nikumbha also and Kumbhakarna of mighty prowess, Kumbha also, night ranger Dum raksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Teekshanavega, Asanibhra, Suptanga, Yagnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Rakshasas Simhadri, Arigna, Vikata, Tapana, Dama also, Praghaasa, Praghasa, Prajaghna, and Jaghan also, Durdarsha, Agniketha, heroes Rasmikethu, Vidyajihva, Dwijihwa, Suryasatru, and Rakshasas Akampana, Suparswa, Chakramali, and Rakshasas Kampana, and energetic Devanthaka and Naranthaka have been killed by you.\" \"The heroic Prahastha, Nikumbha also and Kumbhakarna of mighty prowess, Kumbha also, night ranger Dum raksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Teekshanavega, Asanibhra, Suptanga, Yagnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Rakshasas Simhadri, Arigna, Vikata, Tapana, Dama also, Praghaasa, Praghasa, Prajaghna, and Jaghan also, Durdarsha, Agniketha, heroes Rasmikethu, Vidyajihva, Dwijihwa, Suryasatru, and Rakshasas Akampana, Suparswa, Chakramali, and Rakshasas Kampana, and energetic Devanthaka and Naranthaka have been killed by you.\" \"The heroic Prahastha, Nikumbha also and Kumbhakarna of mighty prowess, Kumbha also, night ranger Dum raksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, Teekshanavega, Asanibhra, Suptanga, Yagnakopa, Vajradamshtra, Rakshasas Simhadri, Arigna, Vikata, Tapana, Dama also, Praghaasa, Praghasa, Prajaghna, and Jaghan also, Durdarsha, Agniketha, heroes Rasmikethu, Vidyajihva, Dwijihwa, Suryasatru, and Rakshasas Akampana, Suparswa, Chakramali, and Rakshasas Kampana, and energetic Devanthaka and Naranthaka have been killed by you.\" \"You have made short of many exceedingly mighty leaders of Rakshasas and swum the ocean. You cross this hoof mark of a cow without delay.\" \"O Vanaras! Left over Rakshasas only to be conquered now. Rakshasas, who were proud of their might have been killed on meeting you.\" \"For the sake of Rama, I will strike my brother's son. Being a father, taking pity, I am helpless as it is not proper for me to take the life of my son.\" \"I wish to kill him, tears are clouding my eyes. Mighty armed Lakshmana will kill him. Vanaras collected together are coming near him and can destroy his attendants.\" Incited by the encouraging words of Vibheeshana (Rakshasa), Vanara chiefs rejoiced and went shaking their tails. Then the tigers among monkeys again and again roaring in seeing the clouds made several kinds of sounds like peacocks. All the troops surrounded by Jambavan too, pierced the Rakshasas with their nails and teeth. The Rakshasas who were endowed with mighty strength giving up fear, armed with different kinds of weapons surrounded Jambavan, the Lord of Bears. The Rakshasas then assailed Jambvan who was destroying the Rakshasa army with axes, pointed arrows, iron bars and sharpedged spears. Fearful and vehement battle took place between enraged Vanaras and Rakshasas making loud clamours like the battle (in the past) between Devas and asuras. Great selfHanuman too became furious and dismounting Lakshmana from his back uprooted a sala tree from a mountain and went on exterminating thousands of Rakshasas. Great selfHanuman too became furious and dismounting Lakshmana from his back uprooted a sala tree from a mountain and went on exterminating thousands of Rakshasas. Mighty Indrajith who can give tough fight to enemies gave a violent fight to his father's brother and again rushed towards Lakshmana. In that battle the two heroes, Lakshmana and Indrajith rained streams of arrows on each other and engaged themselves in the battle. Both the mighty and energetic heroes, covered each other with arrows just as after summer the moon and Sun are veiled frequently by clouds. While both were fighting, due to the quickness of their hand movement, it could not be perceived whether they were taking out arrows from the quiver, drawing the string, or seizing arrows, or aiming to shoot or not. Whether they were drawing or stretching the bow or not or fixing with their fist or hitting the target or not, was not clear. While both were fighting, due to the quickness of their hand movement, it could not be perceived whether they were taking out arrows from the quiver, drawing the string, or seizing arrows, or aiming to shoot or not. Whether they were drawing or stretching the bow or not or fixing with their fist or hitting the target or not, was not clear. As they were discharging arrows from the bow swiftly, the arrows formed a net covering all over the sky and no object could be visible. As Lakshmana was meeting Indrajith and Indrajith was reaching out to Lakshmana, confusion prevailed about who was hitting whom? while both of them one over the other swiftly extended and loosened the whetted arrows continuously, the sky, shrouded with arrows, became dark. Many hundreds of pointed arrows falling in all directions and intermediate points spread all over. As the sun sank down, darkness enveloped, everything was dark and dreadful in appearance. Streams of blood of thousands flowed. Carnivorous animals cried frightfully with their tongues. Wind did not blow, the fire did not glow. Sages murmured saying\" may this world be well.\" Gandharvas, Charanas (who came to see the battle) went distressed. Then Saumithri pierced with four shafts all the four black horses decked in gold, of the lion of Rakshasas (Indrajith) and finished them Then glorious Raghava with pointed bhalla furnished with beautiful plumes, splendid, deadly as Indra's thunderbolt, released and as it resounded the hit of the sword and severed the head from the body of the charioteer, who was driving in circles. Then glorious Raghava with pointed bhalla furnished with beautiful plumes, splendid, deadly as Indra's thunderbolt, released and as it resounded the hit of the sword and severed the head from the body of the charioteer, who was driving in circles. Then glorious Raghava with pointed bhalla furnished with beautiful plumes, splendid, deadly as Indra's thunderbolt, released and as it resounded the hit of the sword and severed the head from the body of the charioteer, who was driving in circles. When the charioteer got killed, the brilliant son of Mandodari, played the role of charioteer and wielded the bow again. While Indrajith was engaged with the horses in one hand and battling, his capacity was a wonder to the onlookers. Lakshmana again attacked him loosening pointed arrows at him while Indrajith was busy with his bow. While Indrajith was moving undaunted being hurt, Lakshmana who acts with extreme alacrity and fearless easily pierced Indrajith with arrows. Seeing the charioteer killed, Ravana's son was despondent and lost enthusiasm to fight (said people). The Vanara leaders were joyful upon seeing the worried face of the Rakshasa and acclaimed Lakshmana. Then the four monkey leaders, Pramati, Rabahasa, Sarabha, and Gandamadhana exhibited their intolerance and went quickly. The four Vanaras of remarkable valour and of terrific courage getting up immediately fell on the best of the horses (of Indrajith). Those Vanaras of huge mountain forms getting on top of those horses (of Indrajith), The horses were mutilated, broken, and sunk into the earth and killed. Again, bounding the great chariot, they got up quickly and stood nearby Lakshmana. The horses were mutilated, broken, and sunk into the earth and killed. Again, bounding the great chariot, they got up quickly and stood nearby Lakshmana. Charioteer dead, horses killed that Indrajith leapt down and assailed Lakshmana by raining arrows.",
                "The nightranger, effulgent Indrajith standing on the ground very angry, with horses lost, was flaming with energy. Exceedingly wanting to kill one another, wielding bows, both sallied forth like Lordly elephants in the forest, to succeed. Moving all over, both Rakshasas and Vanaras killing one another in the battle did not leave their master. Then Ravana's son, praising all the Rakshasas making them happy, spoke these words. \" As all directions are spread with darkness now it is not possible to know who one's own is or others at this time.\" \"You delude the sight of Vanaras in battle. I will come to the battle taking the chariot.\" \"While I enter the city you must see that these wicked minded Vanaras do not prevent me from going.\" Ravana's son, a slayer of his enemies, having spoken to Vanaras in that way, in deceiving manner entered Lanka to get the chariot. Ravana's son ascended a decorated chariot yoked to horses, directed by a charioteer who could tender good advice and a knower of the nature of horses. It was a beautiful chariot decked with darts and swords adorned with gold which Ravana's son of extraordinarily bright, who has won enemies, ascended. Ravana's son ascended a decorated chariot yoked to horses, directed by a charioteer who could tender good advice and a knower of the nature of horses. It was a beautiful chariot decked with darts and swords adorned with gold which Ravana's son of extraordinarily bright, who has won enemies, ascended. Heroic son of Mandodari, impelled by the force of destiny, departed from the city surrounded by Rakshasas. Heroic in the act of destruction of enemies, Indarjith having started from the city in his chariot drawn by swift horses assailed Vibheeshana and Lakshmana. Seeing Indrajith seated in the chariot, great hero Lakshmana as well as the Vanaras and Vibheeshana wondered how easily he went and returned. Indrajith, highly enraged, struck Vanara leaders with a volley of hundreds and thousands of arrows. Indrajith, a winner of combat, became highly furious and stretched his bow showing his skill easily struck at Vanaras. (The Vanaras), though endowed with prowess and of terrific courage, struck by the Rakshasa, they sought refuge of Lakshmana, their Lord, just as people seek the refuge of their Lord, the creator. There, in the battlefield the delight of Raghus glowing with anger shattered the Rakshasas showing the skill of his hand s. Indrajith seizing another bow hastily targeted at Lakshmana and Lakshmana split them with three arrows. Then Saumithri pierced with five arrows into the chest of Indrajith like a venomous serpent and split the bow. Those arrows released from the great bow of Lakshmana, entered the body of Indrajithand fell on the ground like a huge red serpent. Bow split, ejecting blood from mouth, Indrajith took his strong best of bows which had a stout string. Indrajith, aiming at Lakshmana, let loose rain of arrows easily like rain. Lakshmana, the tamer of enemies, without reacting intercepted the shower of arrows released by Indrajith which was difficult to resist. Highly energetic Lakshmana, a delight of Raghus, unperturbed, demonstrated to Indrajith, which was a wonder indeed. Then extremely angry Lakshmana pierced all the Rakshasas quickly, each one with three arrows and struck them and even the son of Rakshasa king, exhibiting his skills. Then extremely angry Lakshmana pierced all the Rakshasas quickly, each one with three arrows and struck them and even the son of Rakshasa king, exhibiting his skills. Indrajith, who was grievously wounded by his hostile enemy, Lakshmana, the destroyer of hostile enemies, continuously discharged arrows at him. Heroic enemy, the righteous Lakshmana, tore the head of the carwarrior as well as the charioteer in the battle with bhala (spear), even before Indrajith discharged pointed arrows at him. There, though there was no charioteer, the horses went round in circles and as they went forward it was wonderful. Saumithri of untiring valour, overcome with fury in the battle, struck the horses to scare them and destroyed them. Indrajith, unable to tolerate the action of Saumithri, was angry and struck him with ten arrows. His arrows, which resembled thunderbolts and were like venomous serpents, touching Lakshmana's shield shining like gold, broken, and fallen Ravana's son, knowing that it is not possible to break the shield of Lakshmana, quickly showed his weapon with three arrows with plumes and gems and struck him on the forehead. Ravana's son, knowing that it is not possible to break the shield of Lakshmana, quickly showed his weapon with three arrows with plumes and gems and struck him on the forehead. Lakshmana, the delight of Raghus, who loved to fight, looked charming in the battlefield with three arrows stuck on his forehead looking like three mountain peaks. Then in the battle, pierced by Rakshasa in that manner, Laksmana immediately stretched his bow and struck with five arrows on the face of Indrajith, who was adorned with auspicious earrings. Both heroes of extraordinary might and equipped with huge arms, endowed with terrific valour, Lakshmana and Indrajith struck one another with sharp arrows. Then smeared with blood the two, Lakshmana and Indrajit, shone like fully blossomed Kimsuka in battle. Both wishing for victory, set to tear each other, pierced dreadful arrows on one another all over the limbs, opposing. Then Ravana's son in his charming countenance, filled with wrath because of conflict, struck at Vibheeshana with three arrows. Having struck Vibheeshana with three arrows, he struck again all the Vanara leaders with one arrow each. Brilliant Vibheeshana struck evil minded Indrajith, his horses and elephants with his mace. Highly energetic Indrajith, leaping down from the chariot, horses destroyed, now hurled a javelin at his uncle in the chariot. Observing the javelin coming towards him, Lakshmana, the delight of Raghus and enhancer of Sumithra's joy, split it into ten pieces, which had fallen on the ground. Vibheeshana of strong body, pierced five arrows like thunderbolt in impact into the chest of Indrajith. The arrows with red feathers of Vibheeshana having penetrated the body of Indrajith, piercing into the body they became red coloured seemed like a red serpent. Indrajith, angry with his uncle, staying in the midst of Rakshasas, seized a mighty strong best arrow gifted by Yama. Extraordinarily brilliant and of terrific valour, Lakshmana, perceiving the mighty shaft yoked by him (by Indrajith), he took up another arrow. That arrow was gifted to Lakshmana in dream by Kubera, the god of wealth and even Suras or Asuras cannot resist it and is difficult to win. Excellent bows of the two made noise like Krauncha birds while being drawn with great strength by the two, whose arms resembled iron bars. The two best bows of both the heroes together, being powerful, shone with splendour when drawn with bowstring. Those arrows released from the bows lit the sky when their heads collided with each other and glowed by rubbing against each other. By the impact of the two arrows brought together, a formidable form of fire frightening with smoke and sparks was created. In the battle both of them touching each other in conflict like the major planets flew into a hundred pieces and fell on earth. Then both Lakshmana and Indrajith in the face of the battle seeing their arrows in nought with each other were abashed and got agitated. Enraged Saumithri, seizing the weapon of Varuna, skilled in warfare loosened on Indrajith (Mahendra's enemy), which was presided over by Rudra. Then the very wonderful weapon of Varuna was made ineffective by the highly energetic Indrajith's who used glowing fire missiles as if to destroy the whole world. Then the very wonderful weapon of Varuna was made ineffective by the highly energetic Indrajith's who used glowing fire missiles as if to destroy the whole world. Then Lakshmana used a Sun missile and repelled (Indrajith's fire missile). Seeing his missile obstructed, Indrajith deluded with anger used a sharp Asura missile capable of destroying the enemy. By the Sun missile, the Kutamudgaras, tridents, Bhusundas, swords and axes issued forth from Indrajith's bow. Effulgent Lakshmana, seeing the terrible Asura missile and deliberating that it is capable of destroying all human beings and difficult to repel, used a Maheswara missile to divert. Effulgent Lakshmana, seeing the terrible Asura missile and deliberating that it is capable of destroying all human beings and difficult to repel, used a Maheswara missile to divert. The war between both was wonderful and horripulating. Beings from the sky saw Lakshmana diverting the Asura missile. As the frightful war between Vanaras and Rakshasas went on, many beings surrounded in the sky were astonished and looked charming. The Rsis, Devatas, manes, Gandharvas, Garudas, serpents and Indra who had performed hundred sacrifices, protected Lakshmana in war. And thereafter, Raghava's brother fitted another excellent arrow which had the impact of the touch of fire capable of tearing Indrajith. The arrow with lovely feathers, consisting of beautiful parts, skilfully done, well jointed, decked with gold, was not only difficult to put off but also difficult to bear, was capable of destroying enemies, frightful, resembling venomous serpents, and worshipped by gods. The arrow with lovely feathers, consisting of beautiful parts, skilfully done, well jointed, decked with gold, was not only difficult to put off but also difficult to bear, was capable of destroying enemies, frightful, resembling venomous serpents, and worshipped by gods. In the past at the war between Devas and Asuras, a mighty and energetic valiant Lord of Devas who had green horses conquered Danavas (with the same sword). Son of Saumithri, that prosperous Lakshmana, drawing Indra's missile, the foremost one, and also the best of arrows, which has never been defeated, spoke these words set to achieve the purpose. \"If Dasharatha's son, Sri Rama is righteous, truthful, of unrivalled valour and true to his promise this arrow will kill Indrajith.\" Having spoken that way, Lakshmana, heroic in battle, bending the bow, stretching the arrow till the ear released on Indrajith. Prosperous Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemies, aiming at Indrajith's head shining with earrings belonging to the head severed from the body, it fell on ground. Prosperous Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemies, aiming at Indrajith's head shining with earrings belonging to the head severed from the body, it fell on ground. Trunk broken off, the huge head of Indrajith bathed in blood was seen on the earth shining like gold. Thereafter Indrajith with his shield, and helmet of the head broken was thrown on earth killed. Then Vibheeshana and all the Vanaras rejoiced just as Devas, when Vrtasura was killed. Then shouts of victory aroused from the heavens from the created beings of heaven, Rsis also, Gandharvas and Apsaras. Great army of Rakshasas even though desired to win seeing (Indrajith dead), Vanaras started attacking them. Unable to bear Rakshasas screamed. Those Rakshasas being killed by Vanaras, went running to Lanka leaving their weapons, with senses lost. All Rakshasas feared and panic stricken fled in hundreds, in groups in all directions leaving their sharpedged spears, swords, and axes. Pained by Vanaras, some fearful entered Lanka, few had fallen in the ocean and some sought refuge in the mountain. Indrajith was lying, having fallen on the ground, and not even one of the thousands of Rakshasas was present there to see. Just as Sun rays go away as soon as the Sun sets in the evening, the Rakshasas also went in all directions seeing Indrajith fallen. Shorn of life, the broad shouldered Indrajith remained on the ground like the Sun whose rays have become cool, after death. Then many were at peace and rejoiced in the world, being relieved, when Ravana's son dropped dead. Glorious Rakshasa of sinful deeds having been killed, all including great sages and Indra felt rejoiced. In heaven also, sounds of drums of Gandharvas, great souls and dance of Apsaras were heard. With cruel minded Rakshasa killed, celebrities showered rain of flowers praising the wonderful deed. As the terror of all worlds had fallen and the water from the sky became pure, Devas and Danavas rejoiced and came there. Devas, Danavas and Ghandharvas arrived there and said, \"Let the Brahmins be without anxiety and move about without fear.\" When, the best of Rakshasa, a leader of extraordinary prowess was killed, the Vanara army seeing Lakshmana felt happy and greeted him. Vibheeshana and Hanuman, leader of Bears Jambavan praised Lakshmana and greeted him for his victory. Having accomplished their goal, monkeys roaring, playing, surrounded Lakshmana, and stood. Then Vanaras wagging their tails and lashing them announced slogans saying,\" Lakshmana is winning.\" The monkeys feeling very happy embraced one another singing in praise of Lakshmana saying\" Lakshmana has won\"and stories related to Lakshmana",
                "Body having auspicious marks, smeared with blood, Lakshmana experienced the joy of having won Indra in battle. Then Valiant and mighty Lakshmana called Jambavantha, Hanumantha, all the Vanaras, following Vibheeshana and Hanuman quickly reached Sugriva and Raghava. Then Valiant and mighty Lakshmana called Jambavantha, Hanumantha, all the Vanaras, following Vibheeshana and Hanuman quickly reached Sugriva and Raghava. Thereafter Saumithri went close to Rama and offered prayers, like Indra's brother Upendra and stood close to his brother. Then heroic Lakshmana coming close to the great selfRaghava, in shaking tone (being tired) reported\" Indrajith is killed.\" Then Vibheeshana gladly informed Rama that Ravana's son's head had been severed by great Lakshmana. As soon as Lakshmana said that Indrajith was killed, Rama was very glad and immediately spoke as follows. \"Well done, Lakshmana! I am glad. A difficult deed has been done. By the fall of Indrajith success has been achieved.\" Bending the head of Lakshmana, a valiant one and enhancer of glory, who was shy of praising him, Rama lovingly, forcibly drawing him onto his lap and making him sit on examined again and again the wounded body and looked at him. Bending the head of Lakshmana, a valiant one and enhancer of glory, who was shy of praising him, Rama lovingly, forcibly drawing him onto his lap and making him sit on examined again and again the wounded body and looked at him. Lakshmana, a bull among men, body tormented by arrows, immersed in pain, breathing heavily. Rama stroking him, restoring his confidence, quickly spoke as follows. Lakshmana, a bull among men, body tormented by arrows, immersed in pain, breathing heavily. Rama stroking him, restoring his confidence, quickly spoke as follows. \"You have done an extremely beneficial task which is difficult for others to do. I think Ravana is killed in the battle with your action of killing Indrajith.\" 'Ravana was depending on Indrajith indeed. Now by that a great action of severing his right hand in comb at by Vibheeshana and Hanuman, I consider victorious.' 'Ravana was depending on Indrajith indeed. Now by that a great action of severing his right hand in comb at by Vibheeshana and Hanuman, I consider victorious.' 'Hero! In three days and nights indeed, you have made short of Indrajith. Hearing that Ravana's son has been made short of, Ravana will come now with large army troops.' 'On hearing of his son's death, the Rakshasa Lord will come forth with a huge army. Turning towards him I will put an end to him.' Lakshmana, with you as my protector and Indra's enemy killed, neither Sita nor earth will be difficult to get back. Rama, the celebrated scion of Raghu dynasty, restored the confidence of Lakshmana and embraced him happily. He invited Sushena and spoke as follows. \"O very wise Sushena! Treat Saumithri in such a way that this Lakshmana, loved by friends pained by the arrows pierced, will be relieved.\" \"Let Vibheeshana and Saumithri be treated quickly. Let all the army of Bears and others who fought with trees, and the heroes be treated. Let all others who fought in the battlefield and wounded be also healed by your effort and make them happy.\" \"Let Vibheeshana and Saumithri be treated quickly. Let all the army of Bears and others who fought with trees, and the heroes be treated. Let all others who fought in the battlefield and wounded be also healed by your effort and make them happy.\" Spoken by Rama in that manner, the great Vanara leader, Sushena gave supreme medicine to Lakshman through his nose. He then inhaled the fragrance and got freed from arrows, the pain of wounds and restored to normal state. Then by Rama's order Vibheeshana and other friends and all Vanara leaders were healed. Then Saumithri, freed from arrows, relieved from pain, anguish gone in a moment, and naturally restored, was happy. At that time, Rama, also the monkey leader, and Vibheeshana, Jambavan with their army seeing Lakshmana getting up, free from wounds were full of joy.",
                "Then, having known about the distressing fall of Indrajith, the ministers of Ravana reported to the tenheaded Ravana. \"O King! Your glorious son was killed by Lakshmana with the assistance of Vibheeshana, as we were witnessing.\" \"Your son who has never been defeated in war, who won Indra, the ruler of gods, after fighting and fighting was killed by Lakshmana's arrows. He has ascended to the higher world.\" On hearing about the enumeration of his son Indrajith's dreadful, frightening and ghastly end, Ravana gave way to swoon. Coming to senses after a long time, the Rakshasa king Ravana, dejected with sorrow of his son's death, lost senses, lamented. 'My son who was a chief of the Rakshasa army, a mighty one, who has won even Indra, how has he become a victim of Lakshmana'? 'When angry, you could pierce with arrows even the time spirit or peak of Mandara mountain, why to speak of Lakshmana again'? 'O mighty armed! Today by virtue of time you have joined Yama and become esteemed King'. 'Killed in war for the cause of the king and treading the path of noble warriors, one attains the heaven. Even for a human it is desirable'. 'Today, seeing Indrajith killed, Devatas in heaven, guardians of the worlds, great sages would be fearless and be happy and comfortable'. Today without Indrajith alone the three worlds (earth, heaven, and underworld) including forests are desolate, dark, and lustreless to me. 'Today in the gynaecium we will hear the cries of Rakshasa maidens like the roaring of elephants in the cave'. 'O Scourge of enemies! You have left giving up prince regent, Rakshasas, from Lanka, your mother, me, and your wife also. And went. Why'? 'O hero! My obsequies should have been done by you. It is peculiar that I have to perform'. 'While Sugriva is living, Lakshmana and Raghava also, deserting me, you have gone. Where have you gone'? Distressed Ravana was lamenting in this way on account of his son deserting, as anger had taken over him. By nature, he is angry. Now with the loss of his son, he was glowing like the Sun that shines brighter by the rays in summer. Ravana's eyebrows contracted on his forehead, he shone like the waves in the great ocean with crocodiles at the time of dissolution of the universe. As Ravana yawned in anger, fire with smoke burst forth from his mouth like Vrtra'. Pondering over the death of his asura son, Ravana was overtaken by fury, and reviwed thinking about the destruction of Vaidehi. By nature, Ravana's eyes are red, through the fire of anger it was even more red glowing and very dreadful. His eyes are naturally dreadful, deluded with fire of anger his form was like Rudra's and threatening. Just as drops of oil drop from flaming lamps, tears dropped from his enraged flaming eyes. When he was biting on his teeth (enraged), the sound from his teeth resembled the sound of a grinder revolved round by Danavas. Fearing Ravana who was enraged like the time of universal destruction, the Rakshasashid themselves in the very quarter he was looking. The Rakshasas could not go near Ravana who was moving in anger in all directions like the moving and unmoving creations move when chased by the god of death. To provoke Rakshasas for battle, an angry Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, spoke as follows. 'I have done penance for thousands of years several times and am a pleased selfborn creator'. 'By the power of the penancedone by me once, creator Brahma has given me reward, pleased with my penance. I have no fear of Asuras or Devas'. 'I was given a shield by Brahma, effulgent like the Sun which the Devas or Danavas could not break with their thunderbolt fists'. 'Today if I, with that shield mounted the chariot go for battle, who can dare to withstand me openly? Even Indra can't'. 'Let that supreme bow and the great arrows bestowed to me, by Brahma the creator who was pleased, when I fought in battle between Devas and Asuras, be brought to destroy Rama and Lakshmana today accompanied by hundreds of trumpets.' 'Let that supreme bow and the great arrows bestowed to me, by Brahma the creator who was pleased, when I fought in battle between Devas and Asuras, be brought to destroy Rama and Lakshmana today accompanied by hundreds of trumpets.' Feeling very sad about the death of his son, cruel Ravana overpowered by anger went thinking to destroy Sita. Redeyed Ravana, looking dreadful with a frightening face, desperate, spoke in a low voice to all Rakshasas as follows. 'My son showed the Vanaras there something which had been killed there to hoodwink as Sita.\" \"I myself will rejoice now in the same way (as Indarjith had done for cheating) making it true. I will destroy that lowly kshatriya, Rama's very dear Vaidehi\". Having spoken like that to the ministers he took up the sword.\" \"I myself will rejoice now in the same way (as Indarjith had done for cheating) making it true. I will destroy that lowly kshatriya, Rama's very dear Vaidehi\". Having spoken like that to the ministers he took up the sword.\" In a totally confused state on account of the death of his son, he went to Mythili taking the excellent sword, which was shining resembling pure sky, feeling enraged, accompanied by his wife, and surrounded by the ministers. In a totally confused state on account of the death of his son, he went to Mythili taking the excellent sword, which was shining resembling pure sky, feeling enraged, accompanied by his wife, and surrounded by the ministers. ( As Ravana marched) the Rakshasas in the abode roared like a lion seeing enraged Ravana and embraced each other (thinking of Ravana's victory) and spoke to one another. \"Seeing Ravana, the two brothers will tremble. By Ravana's fury all the four rulers of the world (Indra, Yama, Varuna, Kubera), would have disappeared. He has struck down many other enemies in wars.\" \"Ravana has collected gems from the three worlds as tax. There is none equal to him in might and prowess in this world.\" As the Rakshasas were talking in that manner, Ravana, deluded with anger, went fast to Vaidehi in Ashoka grove. Highly enraged Ravana, darted just as planet Mars rushed to Rohini in the sky, even while his wellwishers were obstructing. While irreproachable Mythili was being guarded by rakshasi women, she saw him bearing an excellent sword and crossing. When he was repeatedly stopped by friends and obstructed, he was not receding and reaching Janaka's daughter. While irreproachable Mythili was being guarded by rakshasi women, she saw him bearing an excellent sword and crossing. When he was repeatedly stopped by friends and obstructed, he was not receding and reaching Janaka's daughter. Thus spoke Sita filled with sorrow crying,\" This evil minded angry one is coming to me to kill me as though I am an orphan even though I have a protector.\" Thus spoke Sita filled with sorrow crying,\" This evil minded angry one is coming to me to kill me as though I am an orphan even though I have a protector.\" 'I who am devoted to my husband and this Ravana wanted me to revel with him. He has been entreated by me several times. Surely, he, having been rejected by me is dejected, filled with anger and infatuation, intends to kill me, is evident'. 'I who am devoted to my husband and this Ravana wanted me to revel with him. He has been entreated by me several times. Surely, he, having been rejected by me is dejected, filled with anger and infatuation, intends to kill me, is evident'. 'Or else, have the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana fallen to unworthy Ravana on my account'? Many Rakshasas rejoiced, calling out their loved ones loudly, making huge noise, were heard. Wow! Has the destruction of the two brothers brought about on account of the grief of the death of his son or on my account? Not able to kill Rama and Lakshmana, has this fierce Rakshasa who does not hesitate, resolved to kill me? 'I am a foolish woman. I did not follow Hanuman's advice and had I left mounted on his back, no doubt I would be on my husband 's lap. I did not think in this way'. 'I am a foolish woman. I did not follow Hanuman's advice and had I left mounted on his back, no doubt I would be on my husband 's lap. I did not think in this way'. 'Kausalya will think her only son has been killed in the battle. I think her heart would break'. 'She will be crying and keep remembering his birth, childhood, youth, and his rightful actions, and his charm'. 'Son killed, Kausalya will be disappointed, lost sentience will be offering obsequies, surely and enter fire or water and drown'. 'Because of the sinful resolve of hunch back Mandara, this grief has come to Kausalya surely. Let her be burnt'. Seeing Mythili in this manner grieving, just as Rohini fell under the sway of the Mars planet in the absence of the moon, being away from her husband, Suparsva, an upright minister of Ravana who was pure and wise spoke these words of advice to the Lord of Rakshasas in spite of other ministers trying to stop him.

Lord of Rakshasas! You made a vow of celibacy essential for Vedic study, so also engaged in your obligatory duties. Do you think of killing a woman?\" \"O King! Mythili is endowed with charm. Your anger may be exhibited on Rama in battle (not Sita)'.\" \"Today being the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, start on the next day that is the fifteenth dark day surrounded by the army and win.\" \"Shrewd carwarrior, you are wise. Seated in the foremost chariot with your sword, kill Dasharatha's son and attain Sita.\"",
                "Ravana, the king entered the council, angry like a lion, looking piteous, very sad and sat on the seat. Ravana, endowed with mighty prowess, shrunken on account of his son, greeting all the army chiefs with folded hands spoke as follows. \"I shall kill him with huge sharp arrows as the world looks at Rama, once his limbs are struck by you.\" On Rakshasa king speaking like that, all the diverse battalions together departed swiftly on chariots. All the Rakshasas threw at the Vanaras iron bars, clubs, axes, swords, and arrows, which were capable of destroying the life. Vanaras also attacked Rakshasas with trees and rocks. By the time of sunrise, the most terrific war started between Vanaras and Rakshasas, which became tumultuous. The Vanaras and Rakshasas attacked one another with wonderful maces, darts, swords, and axes in war. As the war was in progress, wonderful dust had risen which subsided by the flow of blood of Vanaras and Rakshasas. There with rivers of blood flowing, elephants and chariots were like banks, horses were like fish, staff of chariots like trees and dead bodies as logs of wood seemed. Leaping and jumping the Vanaras and also the leaders of Vanaras bathed in blood broke all kinds of weapons, staff of chariots and the horses. Leaping and jumping the Vanaras and also the leaders of Vanaras bathed in blood broke all kinds of weapons, staff of chariots and the horses. The monkeys with their sharp teeth and nails tore off the hair, ears, noses, and forehead of the Rakshasas, Just as trees laden with fruits are attacked by birds, each one of the Rakshasas was attacked by hundreds of Vanaras. Then the mountainlike forms of Rakshasas attacked the Vanaras with heavy maces, darts, swords, and axes in frightening ways. The Vanaras being struck by Rakshasas sought the protection of Rama, the son of Dasharatha. Then, the highly energetic and valiant Rama, taking up the bow showered rain of arrows on Rakshasa army. Then Rama entered the army with fire like arrows which were consuming the Rakshasas like the clouds in the sky which can't approach the scorching Sun. The night rangers were able to see Rama's terrible action which was difficult for others only after he had performed not otherwise (as they could not see his quick movement). They could not see Rama while he was moving and breaking huge chariots as one would not be able to see the trees in the forest when the wind blew fast. They saw the army shattered, broken into pieces, tormented with darts by Rama but could not make out Rama who was very fast in action. Just as created beings experience their senses and do not perceive their soul, the army experienced the hitting of Raghava by their senses but were not able to perceive him who was hitting them. 'Rama is here killing elephants', 'Here is Rama destroying chariot warriors', 'Rama is killing horses, foot soldiers with sharp arrows', saying like that, the Rakshasas were striking one another in the battle. Being there where Rama was, they were mistaking one another for Rama there because of the socalled resemblance and attacking one another.

Being there where Rama was, they were mistaking one another for Rama there because of the socalled resemblance and attacking one another. The Rakshasas got confused by the supreme missile presided over by Gandharvas, released by Rama, which was burning their army, and were not able to see. In the battle those Rakshasas could see a thousand Ramas at one place and again one Rama alone at another place While Rama was going around in circles with his bow, the Rakshasas were confused, and saw the golden ends of the bow to be like a burning fire stick circling and could not see Rama. People saw Rama in the form of wheel exterminating the Rakshasas on the battlefield, which had the body of Sri Rama as its navel, his strength as its glow, the arrows as spokes, his bow as belly, the twangling of the bowstring as its sound, his virtues and effulgence as the power of his mystic missiles in war. Rama was seen as a wheel of time spirit by the people.

Rama was seen as a wheel of time spirit by the people. In the eighth part of the day, in the battlefield, an army of Rakshasas who were capable of changing their forms at will, constituting a myriad of chariots with wind speed, eighteen thousand fleetfooted elephants, fourteen thousand horses with riders, two lakh Rakshasas fighting on foot exterminated by Rama singlehanded with his arrows that resembled tongues of fire.

Rakshasas dead, chariots destroyed, staff of chariots broken, remaining Rakshasas returned to Lanka. With the elephants, horses, and foot soldiers killed, the battlefield was like the ground where mighty Rudra sported in anger. Then, the Gandharvas, Devas, and Siddhas were very happy and praised Sri Rama saying, 'well done, well done' and offered prayers. Then righteous Sri Rama said to nearby Sugriva, Vibheeshana, Hanuman, Jambavan and leaders of Vanaras like Mainda, Dwivida, that the power of these arrows are in him and Lord Siva only.

                "Ravana heard from every house in Lanka sounds of piteous cries and pathetic sounds of the afflicted. Ravana remained silent for long, thought for a moment and assumed a terrific angry form. Biting his teeth, eyes turned red in wrath, Ravana was perplexed. He was difficult to look at even for the Rakshasas. Thus spoke the Lord of Rakshasas indistinctly in anger with his eyes burning as though it would consume them (Rakshasas). He commanded Mahodara, Mahaparsva and Virupaksha who stood nearby saying\" quickly instruct the army to go.\" Thus spoke the Lord of Rakshasas indistinctly in anger with his eyes burning as though it would consume them (Rakshasas). He commanded Mahodara, Mahaparsva and Virupaksha who stood nearby saying\" quickly instruct the army to go.\" On hearing the words of the king's order, the Rakshasas stricken with fear, unagitated, started thinking. All the Rakshasas with frightful looks saying 'Be it so', having prepared themselves with armor went towards the battlefield. All the great chariot warrior spraying to Ravana with folded palms stood desiring success. Then Ravana who was deluded with anger, laughing aloud spoke to Mahodara, Mahaparsva and Virupaksha. Loosening the shafts from the bow, Ravana resembling the Sun at the time of dissolution of the universe said,\" I shall dispatch Raghava and Lakshmana to the abode of the Lord of death.\" \"Today by the killing the enemy I will take my revenge and also of Khara, Kumbhakarna, Prahastha and Indrajith.\" \"By my arrows covering the sky like clouds there will be no effulgence both in space and in the quarters and not even in the ocean.\" \"Today by the network of plumed arrows released from my bow I shall kill the troops of Vanara leaders' part by part.\" \"Seated on the chariot I shall knock out the Vanara army by the waves in the form of arrows released from the ocean of my bow.\" \"Like an elephant now I shall torment the ponds in the form of battalions of Vanaras shining like the filaments of lotuses, with their faces resembling open lotuses.\" \"Now with the arrows fixed on their faces the Vanara battalions spread on the earth will adorn the earth like lotuses spread on earth.\" \"Today in the combat each one of the arrows released by me will pierce through one hundred monkeys vehemently fighting with trees\" \"Today through the destruction of the enemy I will wipe the tears of the one whose son has been killed, whose brother has been killed.\" \"Today, in the combat, my arrows will split open the Vanaras and ceased of life, they will be covering the earth.

Let the night rangers who survived follow me.\" On hearing the speech of Ravana, Mahaparsva enjoined the mighty leaders of the army standing there and spoke as follows. \"Let the army leaders of mighty valour go hurriedly to search in every house in Lanka for Rakshasas.\" Then the Rakshasas of terrific looks, and frightening faces holding on shoulders roaring departed with swords, spears, tridents, maces, iron bars, halas, sharp pointed javelins, huge Kutamudgaras, staffs and several discusses, sharp Bhindipalas, Sataghnis and many kinds of excellent weapons.

Then by Ravana's command. the chief of the army with chariot rider brought the chariot yoked to eight horses quickly. Then dreadful and selfeffulgent glowing Ravana ascended the chariot.\" Then Ravana surrounded by many Rakshasas set out swiftly rending the earth with all his might and majesty. Duly permitted by Ravana, Mahaparsva and Mahodara who are difficult to overpower and also Virupaksha ascended their chariots. Happy leaders, roaring exultantly, as if breaking the earth, emerged, turning round, desiring victory and sallied forth. Then Ravana surrounded by the army of Rakshasas lifted his bow, like the Lord Yama at the time of dissolution of the universe, went for the battle glowing. Then from the mighty chariot yoked to exceedingly swift horses, the mighty charioteer made his exit from the entrance and saw Rama and Lakshmana there. Then the Sun lost his radiance, and the four directions were enveloped by gloom, the birds made fearful noise and the earth shook. Devas rained blood, horses stumbled, eagles settled on top of the post and jackals howled in a frightening way. His left eye twitched, left arm quivered, face turned pale and indeed his tone became hoarse. Thereafter as Ravana set forth for the battle, all the following forms predicting his death appeared. A meteor had fallen from the sky resembling thunder, coupled with inauspicious eagle cries. Impelled by the time spirit, Ravana set forth without thinking of the terrific portents that had appeared in delusion for his destruction. The Vanaras stood facing the great sound of Rakshasa troops, on hearing the sounds of chariots for the sake of battle. Intense battle took place between the angry Vanaras and Rakshasas challenging one another desiring victory. There the tenheaded Ravana using arrows adorned with gold plumes struck Vanaras and a great war took place. Some Vanaras ' heads were deformed, some were pierced in their hearts, and some had their ears cut off. A few were made lifeless, some had their flanks split, some had their heads smashed and few were deprived of their eyes.",
                "That time the battlefield was strewn with bodies of Vanaras whose limbs had been severed by the arrows of Ravana. Just as moths cannot bear the blazing fire, the Vanaras could not bear the glowing hail of Ravana's arrows even for an instant. Tormented by sharp arrows, the scorched Vanaras fled screaming like elephants enveloped in flames. At that time, driven by Ravana's arrows, the Vanaras fled from the battlefield just like huge clouds are dissipated by wind. The Rakshasa king, having destroyed the forest rangers, thereafter, went to Raghava hurriedly. Seeing the defeated and broken monkeys, Sugriva assigned Sushena for their protection and went to the battle making others wonder at his wonderful action. Sugriva, being a hero himself, uprooting a tree as a weapon, went towards the enemy after having assigned Sushena the responsibility of protection of Vanaras. All the leaders of the army themselves seizing hold of huge mountains and trees of several kinds followed his side. Great Sugriva roaring at high pitch in war destroyed several other Rakshasas and went towards the best of Rakshasas. The Vanara Lord of gigantic body, moving like the wind, tortuously destroyed the Rakshasas like a huge wind destroying the universe. Just as clouds shower hail stones on flocks of birds in the forest, Sugriva rained showers of rocks on the Rakshasas. Hit by the rocks rained by the Vanara king, the Rakshasas with heads broken and body mutilated had fallen like mountains. And thereafter, all the Rakshasas shattered by Sugriva, tormented, fallen on the ground were shouting. Seeing that Virupaksha, himself, who is difficult to encounter, holding his bow, announcing his name, jumped from the chariot onto an elephant in a rut. And thereafter, all the Rakshasas shattered by Sugriva, tormented, fallen on the ground were shouting. Seeing that Virupaksha, himself, who is difficult to encounter, holding his bow, announcing his name, jumped from the chariot onto an elephant in a rut. That great charioteer Virupaksha ascended the elephant, frightening like a lion, and rushed towards Vanaras roaring. Releasing arrows at the army of Vanaras and Sugriva, he (Virupaksha) pierced arrows and relieved the Rakshasas of fear and made them happy. The king of Vanaras, pained by the shafts of Rakshasa, roared, and became very furious. He set in his mind to kill the Rakshasa. Then springing up, the valiant Vanara uprooting a tree struck the face of the Rakshasa seated on the great elephant. Overwhelmed by the blow of Sugriva, that great elephant retreated four cubits, distressed, and roared. That valiant Rakshasa hero jumped down quickly from the wounded elephant, seizing hold of a shield made of bull's hide and a sword, advancing towards the enemy who stood firmly, and facing him, as if threatening him. That valiant Rakshasa hero jumped down quickly from the wounded elephant, seizing hold of a shield made of bull's hide and a sword, advancing towards the enemy who stood firmly, and facing him, as if threatening him. Holding a huge rock which was like a mass of clouds, Sugriva, who was very angry, hurled at Virupaksha. Then that exceedingly powerful Rakshasa leader, seeing the rock falling, struck it with a sword, jumping. Struck by the mighty Rakshasa with a sword, the Vanara leader, a heroic one, got wounded, and became unconscious for a while. Then in that great war, Sugriva getting up at once whirling his fist, hit (Virupaksha) him on the chest. Hit by the fist, Virupaksha became very angry and tore the armor of Sugriva by his sword in the forefront of the army. Wounded severely, Sugriva fell on his feet. Dropped down by him (Virupaksha), Sugriva, got up, and gave the Rakshasa a slap with his palm which was equal to thunderbolt that produced a terrific sound like crash. Virupaksha, escaping the slap of Sugriva with great skill, hit him (Sugriva) on the chest with his fist. Then Sugriva, the king of the forest, grew angry and hit the Rakshasa on the forehead. The Vanara, seeing the blow given by Virupaksha, enraged Sugriva hit him with another palm on the temporal bone by which he fell. Hurt by the palm which resembled Indra's weapon, blood started flowing from Virupaksha's body just like water flowed from waterfalls. Bathed in blood, vomiting blood, Virupaksha fell on the ground. Hurt by the palm which resembled Indra's weapon, blood started flowing from Virupaksha's body just like water flowed from waterfalls. Bathed in blood, vomiting blood, Virupaksha fell on the ground. The Vanaras witnessed Virupaksha who had misshapen eyes, turning his eyeballs in anger, foaming blood flowing from nostrils. Virupaksha rolled, by changing sides bathed in blood, causing sorrow and compassion to Vanaras who witnessed. Thus, both close to each other, both redoubtable armies, of Vanaras and Rakshasas, both powerful and terrific, both mighty, roared as if the great ocean had burst.",
                "In the major conflict, each one destroying the other army, it seemed like the midsummer lakes totally lost its water. The Lord of Rakshasas, Ravana, became doubly angry by the destruction of his army and fall of Virupaksha. Rakshasa's army was killed by Vanaras and drastically reduced. Seeing the adversary of God's grace, Ravana was agonized on witnessing it. And then Ravana spoke to Mahodara who was close by, one who is difficult to encounter, saying \" At this time the hope for my victory is centered in you.\" \"O heroic Mahodara! Today, exhibit your valour by destroying the enemy army. Having received my subsistence, this is the time to repay. Fight well in war.\" Having spoken like that by the king of Rakshasas, Mahodara entered the army of the enemy like a moth enters fire. Thereafter, the mighty and brilliant Mahodara, in obedience to the word of the king, inspired by his own valour, went to fight with Vanaras. The mighty Vanaras also seizing huge rocks entered into the frightening enemy army of the Rakshasas. In that great war, enraged Mahodara with arrows decked in gold shattered the Vanaras by attacking on hands, legs, and thighs. Thereafter, unable to bear the pain, those Vanaras hit by Rakshasas, went in ten directions and some went to Sugriva for refuge. Seeing the great army of Vanaras defeated in the conflict, Sugriva rushed towards Mahodara. Endowed with great energy, Sugriva, the monkey Lord, seizing a huge mountain like dreadful rock, hurled to kill Mahodara. Then seeing the formidable rock coming towards him, he was not bewildered and immediately struck and broke it with his arrows. That rock, struck by Mahodara fell on the ground shattered and broken into a thousand pieces. Seeing the fragmented rock, Sugriva was deluded with anger, and tearing up a sala tree, he shattered on the Rakshasa (Mahodara) in the battlefield. Mahodara, a scourge of enemy forces, who lacerated Sugriva in that manner, angry, made the tree fall on the ground. Sugriva, picking up that glowing iron bar, exhibiting its top, whirling it around, struck the best of horses of Mahodara. Then the hero, Mahodara, his horses destroyed, jumped from the great chariot, and took hold of a mace. Both the heroes, Mahodara and Sugriva like two bulls holding mace and iron bar respectively, like clouds charged with lightning came roaring in the battlefield. Then provoked by anger, the night ranger, Mahodara flung his mace at Sugriva which shone like the Sun. In that terrible conflict, seeing the mace broken and falling, mighty Sugriva, whose eyes turned red in anger, lifted up his iron bar, struck at the mace of the Rakshasa. The mace fell on the ground and broke into pieces. In that terrible conflict, seeing the mace broken and falling, mighty Sugriva, whose eyes turned red in anger, lifted up his iron bar, struck at the mace of the Rakshasa. The mace fell on the ground and broke into pieces. Then, energetic Sugriva picked from the ground a frightening steel club encrusted with gold on all sides. Sugriva took up the steel club and hurled at Mahodara who took another mace and hit back. Both collided with each other and shattered they fell down on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, both of them fully endowed with strength, with their weapons broken, who resembled glowing fires, fought with their fists. Then both of them again and again striking each other slapping with palms fell down and rolled on the ground. Then quickly getting up striking one another, both the heroes who have never been defeated, pushed each other by their arms. Both being scourge of their enemies, both heroes wrestling were exhausted with fighting. Then the Rakshasa picked up a sword lying not far from there along with a shield. Likewise, Sugriva endowed with speed, a champion of Vanaras, took up a huge sword fallen down with a shield. Then the two, whose limbs ceased, who were knowledgeable in the use of weapons, furious, sprang forward in the battle, both with joy, roaring to destroy one another. Enraged at one another, intent to win, both stretched forth at great speed, going from left to right in circles and encountered each other. Mahodara, a warrior, evil minded one, endowed with great speed, hurled the sword on the shield of Sugriva. While Mahodara was extracting the sword stuck to the head, Sugriva, the elephant of the monkeys, severed the head of Mahodara which was decked with earrings and helmet. Mahodara's head severed and fell on the ground. Seeing that Rakshasa king's army ran from there. Sugriva, the monkey leader having killed Mahodara, the Vanaras shouted in joy. The ten headed Ravana became enraged. Raghava was glad. All the Rakshasas became dull and piteous with sad faces. Out of fear they ran. Just as a part of a huge mountain thrown down, an unassailable Mahodara, fallen on the ground, shone there like Lakshmi, just as the Sun shines by his own radiance.",
                "Gazing at Mahodara killed by Sugriva, mighty Mahaparsva's eyes turned red in anger. He created a commotion in the army of Angada. That leader (Mahaparsva) severed the heads of Vanara leaders from their body just as wind drops fruits from stalks. Then with his arrows, that Rakshasa (Mahaparsva) shattered the arms of some, shoulders of some, sides, and ribs of some Vanaras. By the rain of arrows of Mahaparsva, the Vanaras were dejected and wore a sad look on their face and lost senses. Observing the army oppressed by the Rakshasa leader, Angada, endowed with broad shoulders, exhibited his might speedily like the ocean on full moon days. The foremost of the Vanaras (Angada), taking an iron bar flung on Mahaparsva in the battlefield. By that hit, Mahaparsva became unconscious and fell on the ground, senseless, from the chariot along with the charioteer. Jambavantha, the mighty king of Bears, rushed from his army that looked like a dark cloud. The great hero with his army resembling a heap of black mountain, in his fury seized a huge rock resembling a mountain peak, crushed the chariot and struck the horses. Jambavantha, the mighty king of Bears, rushed from his army that looked like a dark cloud. The great hero with his army resembling a heap of black mountain, in his fury seized a huge rock resembling a mountain peak, crushed the chariot and struck the horses. In a short while, regaining consciousness, mighty Mahaparsva struck Angada again with many shafts. Mahaparsva pierced three shafts into the chest of Jambavantha and attacked Gavaksha with many arrows. Seeing Gavaksha and Jambavantha afflicted by shafts, deluded with anger, Angada took hold of a dreadful iron bar. Vali's son Angada got enraged, seized an iron bar which shone like the radiant sun's rays and stood at a distance to kill Mahaparsva. Angada whirling the iron bar round and round hurled it around and thrown at Mahaparsva. Vali's son Angada got enraged, seized an iron bar which shone like the radiant sun's rays and stood at a distance to kill Mahaparsva. Angada whirling the iron bar round and round hurled it around and thrown at Mahaparsva. That iron bar hurled by Angada hit the forehead of the Rakshasa. Courageous son of Vali, enraged, with all speed, slapped the Rakshasa's ear adorned with shining earrings, with his palm. Angry Mahaparsva, who was endowed with speed and shining brightly, took hold of an extraordinary battle axe in one hand. Extremely enraged Rakshasa, hurled at Vali's son that axe that was cleansed with oil, the clean strong axe that was like feet of a mountain. Angada, full of fury, escaped Mahaparsva's aim to strike his left shoulder blade in violence. Angada, who was equal to his father in his prowess, was highly furious and himself clenched his fist which resembled thunderbolt. Angada who knew the vital parts, pierced into the middle of the breasts of the Rakshasa into the heart by his fist which was equal to Indra's thunderbolt. In that great conflict, struck by the fist, the Rakshasa (Mahaparsva's) heart broke and killed and fell on the ground. Mahaparsva having fallen down in the battle, the army was bewildered, and Ravana was overcome with anger. Highly rejoiced Vanaras roared in high pitch sound. The tall attics and gates of Lanka vibrated with sound. Even the gods, accompanied by Indra, made great sounds. Highly rejoiced Vanaras roared in high pitch sound. The tall attics and gates of Lanka vibrated with sound. Even the gods, accompanied by Indra, made great sounds.",
                "On seeing Mahodara and Mahaparsva killed in the great war, Virupaksha of extraordinary might also killed, Ravana was highly infuriated and addressed the charioteer in the following words. On seeing Mahodara and Mahaparsva killed in the great war, Virupaksha of extraordinary might also killed, Ravana was highly infuriated and addressed the charioteer in the following words. \"On killing both Rama and Lakshmana, I will relieve the sorrow of ministers killed and of Lanka from suffering. That tree in the shape of Rama for which Sugriva, Jambavan, Kumuda, Dwivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana and Hanuman are the principal branches, that tree which will yield flowers and fruit in the shape of Sita will be cut down in the battle. That tree in the shape of Rama for which Sugriva, Jambavan, Kumuda, Dwivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana and Hanuman are the principal branches, that tree which will yield flowers and fruit in the shape of Sita will be cut down in the battle. Ravana, the great charioteer, who could surpass many rushed quickly towards Raghava, by the chariot making great noise reverberating in all directions. By that sound, the rivers, mountains, and forests including the earth, filled with the boars, lions and other beasts were shaken. He released an exceedingly formidable weapon called Taamasa which consumed all the monkeys all over and had fallen. As the Taamasa missile had been built and bestowed by Brahma, the monkeys were unable to bear and by their running dust had risen. Ravana's shafts had burnt many hundreds of Vanaras in war and seeing that Rama took a firm stand. Thereafter, the tiger among Rakshasas having routed the Vanaras from there, saw the lotus petaleyed Rama, endowed with long arms, an unconquered one, the tamer of enemies, standing with his brother Lakshmana like Lord Vishnu with Indra, holding a huge bow that was scraping the sky. Thereafter, the tiger among Rakshasas having routed the Vanaras from there, saw the lotus petaleyed Rama, endowed with long arms, an unconquered one, the tamer of enemies, standing with his brother Lakshmana like Lord Vishnu with Indra, holding a huge bow that was scraping the sky. Then the highly brilliant, mighty Raghava along with Saumithri, witnessing the Vanaras routed in war and Ravana coming towards him. joyful Rama took hold of his bow and held in the midst. Then the highly brilliant, mighty Raghava along with Saumithri, witnessing the Vanaras routed in war and Ravana coming towards him. joyful Rama took hold of his bow and held in the midst. Then he began to stretch his best bow endowed with an impelling force, sounding as if breaking the earth. Then by Ravana's shafts and Sri Rama's stretching of the bow and sound of twang, Rakshasas fell in hundreds. That way when the two princes came near the range of Ravana's arrows, it was like the Sun and the moon near planet Rahu. Lakshmana desiring to fight first stretched his bow and took out his sharp arrows which were like peaks of fire and released. As soon as the excellent archer, Lakshmana released his arrows, effulgent Ravana intercepted the arrows in the sky. Exhibiting his skill by hand, he split the arrows of Lakshmana with only one arrow, three with three and ten with ten. Ravana, who won many battles, overlooking Lakshmana went towards Rama standing like a rock in the battle. Ravana the king of Rakshasas coming near Raghava with angry looks in his eyes, showered rain of arrows at Rama. Then Rama immediately seized hold of bhallas and released swiftly seeing Ravana's volley of arrows flowing. Thereafter, Raghava with glowing terrific arrows, which were like poisonous serpents split the sharp streams of arrows. Thus, Raghava on Ravana and Ravana on Raghava, in that manner sharp arrows showered on one another. Each of them pushing one another by the speed of the arrows, went round in circles and created wonderful rounds. Just as created beings fight at the end of the dissolution of the universe, like God of death and God of retribution, both were fighting discharging arrows which was frightening to all beings. Then the sky overcast with arrows of different kinds seemed like clouds with flashes of lightning. By the speed of the arrows with sharp heads, with plumes of eagles, the shower of extremely pointed arrows covering the sky made it dark and seemed like windows in the sky. Then the sky covered with darkness of arrows was like two huge clouds rising even though the Sun had set. Each of them desiring to end the other, fought a terrific battle like Vrtra and Indra earlier, a great fight unimaginable for others. Both Rama and Ravana were armed with excellent bows, both highly skilled in war, both adept in the use of missiles, both were foremost in fighting and were unmoved. Whichever course they took, by those streams of arrows were seen like waves in two oceans stirred up by the wind. Then Ravana, who made the people cry, whose hands were engaged in the fight, discharged a row of steel arrows into Rama's forehead. Rama, into whose forehead Ravana had stuck arrows, felt them like blue lotuses released from his bow, and did not experience any pain. Then valiant and bright Rama, enraged, chanting the mantras of missiles presided over by Rudra (God of destruction) taking many more arrows, stretching the bow, and fixing discharged arrows. Fallen on the impenetrable shield of Ravana, those arrows did not inflict any pain. Again Rama, who was skilled in the use of all weapons, pierced that king of Rakshasas seated in the chariot with an excellent missile on the forehead. The five headed serpent like arrows released by Rama penetrated and having been repelled by Ravana they entered the earth hissing. Making Rama's missile void, Ravana manifested another missile presided over by demon and released. Arrows having lion and tiger face, buzzards and red geese face, eagles and falcons faced, in the same way arrows with jackals' face, wolves' face, terrible with mouth wide open five headed serpent like fearful sharp arrows were released by Ravana. Arrows having lion and tiger face, buzzards and red geese face, eagles and falcons faced, in the same way arrows with jackals' face, wolves' face, terrible with mouth wide open five headed serpent like fearful sharp arrows were released by Ravana. Deceitful and energetic Ravana provoked by anger, let loose more arrows of boar faced, dog faced, cocks faced, and alligators and serpents faced hissing like serpents and other such arrows against Rama. Deceitful and energetic Ravana provoked by anger, let loose more arrows of boar faced, dog faced, cocks faced, and alligators and serpents faced hissing like serpents and other such arrows against Rama. In that way facing the demonic missiles, the leader of Raghus, overwhelmed, very enthusiastic, released missiles presided over by God of fire. There Rama produced missiles glowing like fire, like Sun 's face, like moon's face, crescent moon face, face like Dhumakethu, missiles like planets, and star faced, with fire sticks like face resembling flashes and lightning and several others and let loose. There Rama produced missiles glowing like fire, like Sun 's face, like moon's face, crescent moon face, face like Dhumakethu, missiles like planets, and star faced, with fire sticks like face resembling flashes and lightning and several others and let loose. Struck by Raghava's missiles, the terrific missiles of Ravana melted in the air and split into thousands of pieces. Sugriva and other leaders, heroes who can change form at their will and all monkeys rejoiced. Sugriva and other leaders, heroes who can change form at their will and all monkeys rejoiced.",
                "Missile being counteracted, Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, doubled the army later in anger. Highly effulgent Ravana used another terrific missile, presided over by Rudra, produced by Maya. Then from his bow issued forth all over flaming tridents, maces, and iron bars like thunderbolt. Several kinds of sharp multitudes of weapons and flaming thunderbolts issued forth like gales at the time of universal destruction. Glorious Raghava, who is the best of those proficient in the use of missiles endowed with great splendour, neutralized that missile (of Ravana) with the missile presided over by Gandharvas. When the missile of Ravana was turned void by the great selfRaghava, Ravana's eyes turned red in anger, and he used a missile presided over by the Sun God. Thereafter, brilliant discus of the Sun God, issued forth from wise Ravana's bow at a terrific speed. As they landed together from the sky glowing like Sun, moon, and the planets, it illuminated the quarters. Raghava with his shafts shattered the discuses and the weapons of Ravana in the forefront of his army. Rakshasa king, frustrated on seeing the missiles, pierced Rama in his private parts with shafts. Even though pierced by Ravana with ten arrows, Rama, endowed with high energy, was not shaken. Then, Raghava, who had won many battles, became highly furious, piercing Ravana in all his limbs with many arrows. In the meantime, enraged Lakshmana, the brother of Rama, a mighty warrior, seized hold of seven shafts. Lakshmana, who was endowed with extraordinary splendour, for his part, with his shafts which had great force, shattered the device of man's head on the flag post of Ravana. Celebrated, mighty Lakshmana struck with his arrows, that hit the head of the charioteer of night ranger, which was glittering with earrings. Then Lakshmana split with five sharpened arrows the bow of Rakshasa king that resembled elephant's trunk. Vibheeshana struck with his formidable mace the horses of Ravana which were like dark clouds and huge like mountains. With the horses of his chariot dead, Ravana descended from the huge chariot and exhibited violent rage against his brother. Then, endowed with extraordinary energy, the powerful leader of Rakshasas hurled a flaming thunderbolt like javelin at Vibheeshana. Lakshmana shattered the javelin with three shafts even before it reached him (Vibheeshana). Then the Vanaras raised loud cheer in that huge conflict. The javelin, which was covered with gold, broke into three parts, and fell down like a huge meteor emitting fire sparks from the heavens. Then, Ravana seized hold of a huge javelin shining with its own splendour, a formidable one even for the god of death. That javelin was endowed with speed, resembling thunderbolt in splendour, whirled round by the mighty and evilminded Ravana, shone. In the meantime, seeing Vibheeshana's life in danger, heroic Lakshmana reached him and stood obstructing (the javelin). Heroic Lakshmana stretched his bow and showered volley of arrows and covered Ravana who held javelin in hand. Covered by the stream of shafts discharged by the great self, Lakshmana, Ravana could not shake his hand and was not inclined in his mind to strike (Vibheeshana). Thus spoke Ravana seeing Lakshmana who stood facing him, who rescued his brother (Vibheeshana). \"Lakshmana! You are proud of your might of rescuing Vibheeshana. Now this javelin released from me will strike at you.\" \"This javelin released by my bludgeonlike arm will pierce your heart and take away your life.\" Enraged Ravana, having spoken in this manner, hurled the javelin adorned with eight bells making loud noise, designed magically by Maya, a stupendous one capable of destroying any enemy, which was glowing with shine, aiming at Lakshmana, and roared aloud. Enraged Ravana, having spoken in this manner, hurled the javelin adorned with eight bells making loud noise, designed magically by Maya, a stupendous one capable of destroying any enemy, which was glowing with shine, aiming at Lakshmana, and roared aloud. Hurled at terrific speed, that javelin, which was equal to thunderbolt, speedily went towards Lakshmana in the forefront of war. Seeing the javelin coming towards Lakshmana, Raghava said 'May Lakshmana be auspicious. May he be well. May your attempt to kill Lakshmana be ineffective and wasted'. Released by Ravana in anger, that javelin, which was like poison of venomous serpent, pierced into the chest of Lakshmana who stood fearless. Glowing like the tongue of Vasuki, the king of serpents, flaming,  descended at high speed on the chest of Lakshmana. Thereafter, Lakshmana fell on the ground, pierced by the javelin, deep into the heart from far with great force by Ravana. Watching Lakshmana in that situation, most courageous Raghava, out of brotherly affection felt despondent at heart. He (Raghava) stood confused for a short while as it was, his eyes filled with tears like fire at the end of the universe. Realizing that this is not the time to be disconsolate, observing Lakshmana's efforts, Raghava resolved to destroy Ravana and started a fierce struggle. Rama beheld Lakshmana pierced with javelin in the great war bathed in blood and resembling a mountain with a snake penetrated into it. It was not feasible for the best of Vanaras to pull out the javelin (from Lakshmana's body) discharged with great strength from Ravana's hand, despite great efforts. It was not feasible for the best of Vanaras to pull out the javelin (from Lakshmana's body) discharged with great strength from Ravana's hand, despite great efforts. It pierced through Lakshmana's body and entered into the earth. Mighty Rama held the terrific javelin with both hands bent it and removed in the course of struggle. While Rama was pulling out the javelin, mighty and courageous Ravana struck him in his private parts and all over the body with arrows. Not minding the arrows struck, Rama embraced Lakshmana and spoke to Hanumantha and the great Vanara Sugriva. \"O foremost of Vanaras! Take care of Lakshmana by surrounding him. Just as clouds appeared before the chataka bird waiting for long, time has come to exhibit my valour which was awaited for long. Now I will destroy the ten headed Ravana of sinful resolve rightfully in a short while from now.\"",
                "Seeing Lakshmana struck by exceedingly mighty, evil minded Ravana's javelin and soaked in blood Rama giving intense fight by discharging arrows also spoke as follows to Sushena. Seeing Lakshmana struck by exceedingly mighty, evil minded Ravana's javelin and soaked in blood Rama giving intense fight by discharging arrows also spoke as follows to Sushena. 'Heroic Lakshmana struck by Ravana, fell on the ground and writhing like a snake and rolling made me sad'. ' As I see Lakshmana, who is more than my life, and loving soaked in blood, my mind is agitated. How can I have the energy to fight?' 'Lakshmana, my brother, is praised for his efficiency in war, is endowed with auspicious marks. If he is met with death, what use is my happiness and life for me?' 'My heroism is shy, my bow slips from my hand, arrows are dropping, my vision is blurred with tears with my brother gone.' 'Seeing Lakshmana in this state, just as in dream, my limbs are retrieving while walking, being on the point of death intense sorrow is growing and the desire to live is gone.' Seeing the brother struck in vital parts and wounded by the evilminded Ravana, Rama was filled with grief and breathing heavily. Beholding his dear brother, who is his life outside him overcome by anxiety, Rama lost senses and gave himself to great sorrow. Seeing the wounded brother Lakshmana in the battlefield, the very sad Rama lost control over his senses and grieved. 'O Hero! Even victory for me will not give joy. What pleasure will one have if he desires to see the moon when he has lost vision?' 'What purpose is there to fight in battle or in life with Lakshmana lying in the forefront struck in the battlefield?' 'Lakshmana who is endowed with splendour followed me to the forest. In the same way I will follow him to the god of death.' 'Lakshmana, who loved the kin and was devoted to me, has been led to pass by the Rakshasas.' 'Wives can be found everywhere, relatives can be found everywhere but biological sibling brothers are not found in any place.' Grieving in this manner, lost control over senses, and discrimination, Rama was sighing again and again and was pitiable. Sushena, the hero consoling Rama spoke these words. 'Without Lakshmana who is difficult to win, what use is kingdom to me? What can I tell mother Sumithra who is the lover of her son?' O Broad shouldered Rama! Enhancer of prosperity, Lakshmana is not dead. His face has not changed, and he has not lost splendour. 'His face is radiant and pleasing to see. His palms are like red lotuses and his eyes are so pleasant'. \"O hero! Those who cease to live will not have such appearance and signs. He who is a tamer of foes is alive. I tell you, do not grieve.\" \"From the movement of his limbs and throbbing of his heart again and again it is known that he is alive.\" Very wise Sushena, having spoken like that to Raghava, spoke to the great Vanara, Hanuman nearby. \"O gentle Hanumantha! Going to that mountain of herbs about which Jambavan had earlier spoken to you, get the herbs from the southern peak of that great mountain. To make Lakshmana the great soul alive quickly go and get Savarankarani, Sarvakarani so also Sanjeevakarani and Sandhanakarani and come.\" \"O gentle Hanumantha! Going to that mountain of herbs about which Jambavan had earlier spoken to you, get the herbs from the southern peak of that great mountain. To make Lakshmana the great soul alive quickly go and get Savarankarani, Sarvakarani so also Sanjeevakarani and Sandhanakarani and come.\" \"O gentle Hanumantha! Going to that mountain of herbs about which Jambavan had earlier spoken to you, get the herbs from the southern peak of that great mountain. To make Lakshmana the great soul alive quickly go and get Savarankarani, Sarvakarani so also Sanjeevakarani and Sandhanakarani and come.\" Sushena having said so, glorious Hanuman set out to the mountain of herbs. Not able to recognise the herbs he thought over. Highly brilliant Hanuman used his intellect and thought to seize the peak of the mountain on which herbs had sprung. By reasoning it is known that the herb which is good for him is grown in this peak, for Sushena said so. 'If I go without taking Visalakarani, through the passage of time huge mistakes will happen and perplexity will arise'. Hanuman, the mighty among the Vanaras, thinking so quickly reached the foremost of the mountains, seized the mountain with both hands by shaking it thrice, uprooted the plants with flowers in bloom and balanced it with his hands. Hanuman, the mighty among the Vanaras, thinking so quickly reached the foremost of the mountains, seized the mountain with both hands by shaking it thrice, uprooted the plants with flowers in bloom and balanced it with his hands. Like a dark cloud filled with water carried by wind, Hanuman held the mountain peak and went in the air from the surface of the earth. Hanuman came at high speed with the mountain and letting it down and resting for a while spoke as follows. \"O leader of the Vanaras! I did not know those herbs. So, the mountain peak was brought here by me.\" The son of wind god, having revealed it like that, Sushena the leader of the Vanaras uprooted the herb and took out. It is a difficult task even for Suras. Seeing Hanuman doing it all the Vanara leaders were amazed. Thereafter, Sushena the foremost of the Vanaras, a brilliant one crushed the herbs and dropped the extract into Lakshmana's nose. The destroyer of enemies, Lakshmana, who was pained by the javelin stuck in his body, on inhaling the herb, was devoid of javelin and rid of pain. He got up from the ground. Seeing Lakshmana rise up from the surface of the ground, the Vanaras said Well done and offered prayers very affectionately. Rama the destroyer of enemies seeing Lakshmana saying, 'come come', eyes filled with tears of joy affectionately embraced him and spoke. Embracing Saumithri, Rama spoke 'luckily you have recovered from death again and I am able to see you'. 'Lakshmana! If you had not come out of death, what use is life to me? What is the use of Sita? What is the meaning of life' said Rama? When Raghava had spoken in that manner, Lakshmana spoke, pained by the irresolute talk (of Rama). \"You who are of truthful valour having made a vow, now speaking in this way, like a lowly person is not appropriate.\" 'Those who speak truth never fail their vows futile for fulfilment of the vows is a mark of greatness for them'. \"O Sinless Rama! To be in despair on my account is not fair. Destroy Ravana and redeem your vow.\" \" A victim of your arrow can not be alive just as an elephant fallen into the clutch of a roaring lion with sharp teeth is not possible to live.\" \"I wish to see the destruction of this evil minded one quickly before the sun completes the day and sets.\"",
                "Courageous Raghava, the destroyer of enemies on hearing the words spoken by Lakshmana took up his bow and fixed it. Rama discharged dreadful shafts at Ravana's army in the forefront. Ravana ascended another chariot and went towards Rama, just as the planet Rahu moved towards the Sun. Seated in the chariot, the ten headed Ravana showered thunderbolt like shafts just as rain cloud showers on a huge mountain and struck. Sri Rama steadily covered Ravana, the ten headed Rakshasa with shining shafts covered with gold glowing like fire in the battle. Rama standing on the earth and Ravana seated on the chariot and waging war is not fair, declared Devas, Gandharvas and Kinneras. The foremost of Devas, the glorious Indra, on hearing their sweet words called his charioteer Matali and spoke as follows. \"Proceed quickly in my chariot to the foremost of the Raghus on the earth, where Sri Rama stands and call him to sit in the chariot as per the words of Devas.\" Lord of Devas having spoken that way, the charioteer of Devas offering salutations to Devas in obedience spoke these words. \"O Devendra, I will do the duty of charioteer duly to the Lord of gods with green horses proceeding quickly\", said the charioteer.\" Thereafter, Matali brought the glorious chariot of Lord of Devas. It was decked with charming gold wheels, body fitted with hundreds of gold bells that shone like the early morning sun, decked with gold on top, green horses with white whisks shining like the Sun, decked with golden net, the horses yoked to staff, and the flag fitted on golden bamboo staff. Descending from the chariot, like from heaven, Matali went towards Kakuthsa. Thereafter, Matali brought the glorious chariot of Lord of Devas. It was decked with charming gold wheels, body fitted with hundreds of gold bells that shone like the early morning sun, decked with gold on top, green horses with white whisks shining like the Sun, decked with golden net, the horses yoked to staff, and the flag fitted on golden bamboo staff.

It was decked with charming gold wheels, body fitted with hundreds of gold bells that shone like the early morning sun, decked with gold on top, green horses with white whisks shining like the Sun, decked with golden net, the horses yoked to staff, and the flag fitted on golden bamboo staff. Descending from the chariot, like from heaven, Matali went towards Kakuthsa. Then the thousand eyed charioteer, holding the whip in hand, from the chariot, offered salutations with folded palms to Sri Rama and spoke these words. \"To you, Kakuthsa, who are endowed with great prowess, destroyer of enemies, this chariot has been sent by Indra for your victory.\" \"Here is Indra's mighty bow, armour shining like fire, shafts resembling the Sun and stainless auspicious javelin.\" \"O heroic king! With me as charioteer, mounting this chariot, kill the Rakshasa Ravana as Mahendra killed the demons.\" Speaking like that, Matali went round Sri Rama, and went round the chariot clockwise saluting him. Sri Rama then ascended the chariot, illuminating his splendour to the world. Then a wonderful, severe thrilling fight took place between Sri Rama and Ravana. Raghava who was highly skilled in the use of supreme weapons destroyed that missile presided over by Gandharvas and gods, released by Ravana. The Rakshasa king, the night ranger, became highly furious and once again discharged the most terrific missile presided over by Rakshasas. The shafts released from Ravana's bow were covered with gold and highly venomous like serpents reached near Kakuthsa. Those shafts with wide flaming mouths, vomiting fire, glowing, frightening, and striking went over to Rama. Flaming coils like the Vasuki, covering all quarters with poison, enveloped all over. Seeing the dreadful reptiles approaching, Rama discharged the missile presided over by Garuda. By the missile discharged by Raghava those reptiles and snakes turned into golden feathered eagles and by the shine of the feathers, the reptiles flew. Those shafts of Rama in the form of eagles which could change their form at will, destroyed the serpent forms and they flew at great speed. King of Rakshasas knocked back, became enraged and covered Rama with a terrific shower of shafts. Thereafter having showered a thousand shafts on Rama, of unwearied action, Ravana pierced Matali with shafts. Ravana attacked the flag post of the chariot with one arrow and felled it down. Then he released a network of arrows on Indra's horses and struck them. On seeing Sri Rama afflicted by the action of evilminded Ravana, the Devas, Gandharvas, Charanas, Danavas also, Siddhas and foremost rishis were despondent. Seeing the moon like Sri Rama eclipsed by planet Rahu in the form of Ravana, the Vanara leaders and Vibheeshana became worried.

Seeing the moon like Sri Rama eclipsed by planet Rahu in the form of Ravana, the Vanara leaders and Vibheeshana became worried. When the planet Budha comes closer to the Rohini planet presided over by the Lord of creation, people predict bad luck. The waves of the ocean were, as if in fury, waves covered with mist turning around as though to touch the radiant sun rose high. The Sun seemed without radiance like the colour of weapon (grey), in the form of Kabhanda (headless trunk), combined with Dhumakethu. In the sky, the planet Mars too stood in constellation with Visakha star presided over by gods Indra and Agni in heaven, which was propitious for the kosala kings. Ravana with ten heads and twenty arms seizing his bow appeared like the Mynaka mountain. While Ravana with ten heads and arms was ready in the forefront of the battle, Sri Rama had no possibility to fix his arrows.",
                "Seeing enraged wise Rama's countenance, all beings on earth were shaken in fear. The mountains that were abode of lions and tigers with trees shook and the ocean, the king of rivers, was seen agitated. Dreadful and portentous clouds went in circles all over sky looking like donkeys emitting harsh sounds. Rama became highly furious, most dreadful sounds were rising up and all beings were frightened. Ravana was also afraid. Then from the aerial chariots, Devas, Gandharvas, great Nagas, sages, devils, giants, birds, and eagles watched the duel war that went on between the heroes clashing with different kinds of frightening weapons like at the dissolution of the world. Then from the aerial chariots, Devas, Gandharvas, great Nagas, sages, devils, giants, birds, and eagles watched the duel war that went on between the heroes clashing with different kinds of frightening weapons like at the dissolution of the world. Then watching the great war, all the Suras, Asuras, lost control and overcome with happiness spoke these words with devotion. Firmly established the Asuras uttered 'Victory to the Ten headed Ravana', and Devas for their part pronounced 'Rama be victorious' again and again. In the meantime, the evil self Ravana who is called so, as he makes others cry, in intense anger making loud noise, stroking an unassailable weapon which was like the thunderbolt, capable of killing all enemies, a spike which closely resembled mountain peaks, dreadful even to think, like a mass of smoke, sharp and pointed, blazing like at the dissolution of the universe, very frightening, difficult to hand le, like the god of death, a terror for all beings, frightening, tearing, splitting, glowing like trident seized hold of to attack Rama.

In the battlefield surrounded by Rakshasa heroes, enraged valiant Ravana took up the trident holding it in the middle. Gigantic Ravana, eyes turned red in anger, raising the trident made formidable noise to make his army extremely joyful in the battlefield. By the horrible sound made by the Rakshasa king, the earth, even the heavens, similarly the quarters and corners trembled. By the loud roar of the evilminded Ravana's sound, all living beings feared and even the ocean was set to tremble. Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary valour, taking hold of the trident, addressed Rama harshly in a loud tone. \"O Rama! This thunderbolt like trident taken up by me now will take away your life along with your brother's.\" \"I, who commend warfare, will quickly kill you today in the forefront of the army and join you with Rakshasa heroes who were killed.\" \"O Raghava! Stay there. Right now, I will kill you with this trident.\" Having spoken that way, Ravana hurled the trident. The trident discharged from Ravana's hand, made circles of lightning, and covered the atmosphere with its glow and shine along with eight bells making loud sounds. Valiant Raghava, seeing the glowing trident that was horrible to look at, loosed a number of arrows at it. Raghava intercepted the trident, just as the fire was obstructed by the flow of water, at the time of universal dissolution, and obstructed. The arrows released from Rama's bow fell on the great trident of Ravana and burnt like moths falling in fire. Rama was overcome with fury on seeing his arrows being crushed to powder in the sky on touching the trident and reduced to ashes. Raghava, the enhancer of the joy of Raghus, lifted up the javelin brought by Matali, esteemed by Indra. When mighty Rama lifted up that javelin, it rendered sonorous sounds of bells and lit up the sky like a meteor at the end of the universal dissolution. With the hurling of the javelin by Rama at the great trident of Ravana and on (the javelin) touching the trident, it was broken, lost its splendour and fell down. Rama then released arrows endowed with great speed, shower of multitude of arrows straight into the horses of Ravana and shattered them. Raghava pierced into the chest of Ravana sharp arrows and with great effort three sharp arrows on the forehead. Pierced all over the limbs with arrows, blood flowing from the limbs, he (Rakshasa king) appeared like an Ashoka tree in the gathering.",
                "Ravana, who was proud of his skill in warfare, became very angry when he was pained by Kakuthsa's arrows. Valiant hero, Ravana, with his eyes flaming in anger, raising his bow, rained arrows at Sri Rama. He continued to rain thousands of arrows just as rain filled the tank, his arrows covered Raghava. Valiant hero, Ravana, with his eyes flaming in anger, raising his bow, rained arrows at Sri Rama. He continued to rain thousands of arrows just as rain filled the tank, his arrows covered Raghava. Sri Rama did not get agitated, and stood like a huge mountain, even though the network of arrows released from the bow of Ravana covered him in the conflict. Valiant Sri Rama stood intercepting them when streams of arrows covered him, and tolerated them like the rays of the Sun. Thereafter the quickhanded angry night ranger struck into the chest of Raghava thousands of arrows. In that conflict Lakshmana's elder brother looked like a huge Kimsuka tree in bloom in the forest body being covered with blood all over. Endowed with extraordinary energy, Kakuthsa, angered by the impact of arrows resembled the Sun at the end of universal dissolution, took up arrows. Then with both Rama and Ravana speedily releasing (hail of) arrows on one another, the battlefield was darkened by arrows, and they were not able to see each other. Then Rama, the heroic son of Dasharatha, overcome by anger, laughing at Ravana, spoke these words. \"Lowly Rakshasa! My wife was abducted by you ignorantly when she was helpless. Therefore, you are not valiant.\" \"Having abducted Vaidehi living in the forest by force, when she was desperate and separated from me, do you think that you are a hero? \"Timid fellow! You having laid hands on another woman think you are a hero? You, who have done such an action, think that you are a hero?\" \"O shameless one! You have transgressed morality and traditional practice. You are dissolute and by your pride seeking death. You think that you are a hero!\" \"By laudable great action performed by you (of abducting Sita and your penance) you have attained fame. You are a heroic brother of Kubera, rich in might.\" \"You will attain the great result of your hurtful action, overpowered by pride and vanity today.\" \"O Evil minded fellow! You boast yourself as a hero, while you abducted Sita like a thief. Shame did not stand in your way.\" \"If Sita had been seen by me forcibly taken by you in my presence, then you would have been killed by my arrows and seen your brother Khara.\" \"O selfish Ravana! Today you have come in my sight by good fortune. I shall send you to the abode of Yama with my arrows.\" \"Now, let your head severed by my shafts lying in dust in the battlefield with the shining earrings be dragged by the carnivorous animals.\" \"Ravana! After your body is caused to destroy and scattered on the ground, let the vultures drink the blood oozing from your chest pierced by the heads of my arrows.\" \"Let the birds tear your intestines as eagles would tear off snakes, now when your body is split and fallen, split by my arrows and ceased of life.\" Speaking in this way to Ravana who was nearby, Rama the exterminator of enemies rained showers of arrows and covered. The strength, valiance, enthusiasm, and the strength of missiles of Rama, who was desirous of the destruction of the enemy, doubled. All missiles appeared before Rama because of his richness in selfknowledge. In his excessive energy and joy the prince became more skillful with his hands. Rama, who can put an end to Rakshasas, knower of his own self having experienced auspicious signs, began to strike at Ravana more vehemently. By the stones thrown by the Vanaras and rain of shafts from Raghava, the ten headed Ravana was pained and was bewildered. Being confused mentally, Ravana did not start his arrows, nor stretch his bow, nor was able to use missiles and was not able to oppose Rama's valour. Ravana's arrows of several kinds being destroyed, perceiving that his death is objective Rama's missiles, and that the time of death appeared, he was unable to act. Observing his (Ravana's) condition, the charioteer quietly, slowly withdrew his chariot from the battlefield.",
                "Enraged out of delusion, by force of destiny, Ravana's eyes turned red in anger and spoke to his charioteer. \"You dullard! Disdaining me as not capable, lacking manliness, powerless, deficient in valour, timid, incapable, petty, devoid of energy, not knowing conjuring tricks, abandoned weapons, driven out, you act not knowing me in your own way foolishly using your discretion.\" \"You dullard! Disdaining me as not capable, lacking manliness, powerless, deficient in valour, timid, incapable, petty, devoid of energy, not knowing conjuring tricks, abandoned weapons, driven out, you act not knowing me in your own way foolishly using your discretion.\" Not knowing my opinion, for what reason have you removed my chariot in the presence of my enemy, belittling me? \"O evil minded one! My fame, glory, valiance and bravery earned over a long period has been wiped out by you.\" \"While my adversary's valour is widely known, you brought me back like a timid one, while I love war, while I am to be praised in the presence of my enemy.\" \"O Evil minded one! If out of delusion you are not willing to drive, truly you are influenced by the enemy.\" What has been done by you is not befitting, this is What an enemy should have done. Being good at heart you have done What is good for enemy. \"If you remember that you lived long with me and know my virtues, quickly turn back the chariot before my adversary with draws. When the insensitive Ravana spoke harshly in that manner, to the charioteer who was wishing his benefit, he spoke in friendly language to Ravana. \"I was not fearing, nor foolish, not won by the enemy, not negligent also, not lacking friendliness and not forgetting good deeds done by you.\" Wishing your welfare, for your fame and to protect you with a friendly and pleasant feeling I did that which is good for you. You are unpleasant about this action. \"O King! I who wish your welfare ought not to be blamed like an unworthy and pettyminded person by mistake.\" \"O yes! I will answer you. Please listen. like the river entering the ocean speedily is diverted, I have taken back the chariot from the battle. \"Great Ravana! After the strenuous task in the battle, there was no exhibition of your valour, and I did not cognize any superiority in your action.\" \"The horses of my chariot were exhausted by dragging, broken down, worn out by the hot sun, and desperate like cows lashed by rain.\" \"Those portents manifesting again and again, that I am seeing, all of them are in the reverse direction (meaning not proptitious).\" \"Propitious and unpropitious, time and place, good and evil signs and omens, depression and liveliness of the warrior as well as strength and weakness of the one in the chariot must be ascertained.\" \"The earths' ups and downs, evenness and ruggedness, difficult locations, the right time and place for war should be known in advance and the inner weakness of the enemy also to be known.\" \"To hold the chariot or advance, to go near the (enemy) or retreat, to return back or advance, everything should be known to the charioteer.\" \"The reason for retreating in this way is to give you rest and relieve the horses from the terrible feat and fatigue. I deserve to be excused for this action.\" \"Heroic Lord! I have not brought back this chariot independently (without thinking). I have acted in friendliness to the master (to give rest) not otherwise.\" \"O Tamer of enemies! Order now and in that way, I shall carry out your order in accordance with you wholeheartedly.\" Ravana was fully satisfied with the words of the charioteer. He praised the charioteer in many ways and spoke like this desiring to wage war. \"Quickly drive the chariot towards Raghava. As a policy, Ravana would never turn back on the battlefield without putting an end to the enemy.\" Fully satisfied with Charioteer's words, Ravana bestowed him with an excellent auspicious ornament of the hand. On hearing Ravana's words, the charioteer advanced the chariot.",

Then Rama endowed with extra ordinary energy having heard Agastya, was very delighted and stopped worry. He remembered Aditya and chanted in his mind.

You are not required to be told. Wishing to fight with rapt attention, I will remind you now and then not instruct you\", said Rama to Matali.\" Matali, the best charioteer of the Devatas, was highly delighted at Rama's words and started driving. Then Matali made the chariot turn round and by the dust rising from the rolling wheels of the chariot, Ravana was shaken. Then furious Ravana, the ten headed Rakshasa, whose eyes turned coppery in anger, struck Rama with arrows. Rama who was provoked by the assault and army was perturbed. He took up Indra's bow of extraordinary impulse and of high speed like sunbeams. The arrows endowed with very high speed, glowing in radiance like the sun's radiance, holding the arrows, each one desirous of killing the other stood facing each other, came near, and started fighting like lions in the great war. Thereafter, the Gandharvas, Devas, Siddhas and sages longing for the end of Ravana came there to witness the duel. Devas rained blood on Ravana's chariot, wind blew in circles intensely from left to right. In the sky, a huge flock of eagles hovering on the chariot of Ravana went following the chariot wherever it went. Lanka seemed glowing in red colour like at dusk, and as though the earth was burning, shrouded with Japa flowers, even though it was daytime. Meteors and huge fire dropped there indicating Ravana's end. Seeing them, Rakshasas were sad. Meteors and huge fire dropped there indicating Ravana's end. Seeing them, Rakshasas were sad. Wherever Ravana went, the earth shook. Many Rakshasas felt their hands clasped. The rays of the Sun fell in front of Ravana, in red, yellow, white, and dark like minerals on the mountain. The vultures followed by shejackals vomited, burning fire from their mouths indicating inauspiciousness and screamed. The unfavourable wind that blew in war, clouded the sight of Rakshasa king. Without clouds, terrific thunderbolts of Indra (rain) dropped on his (Ravana's) army all over causing unbearable sound. All directions and intermediate points were enveloped by darkness by the shower of dust and the huge sky was obscure. Hundreds of minas making frightening sounds, fighting in terrific manner emitting dreadful cries had fallen on the chariot there. His (Ravana's) horses were letting out fire sparks from their hips, tears, water, and fire from their eyes at a time, continuously. In that manner, many frightful and dreadful objects falling indicated destruction of Ravana. On all sides appeared indications of signs of victory for Rama, displaying beings delightful and auspicious. Sri Rama was very delighted over the appearance of good signs of his own victory and thought 'Ravana is destroyed by me'.",
                "Then there ensued a fierce duel between Rama and Ravana that was fearsome to the whole world. Then, both Rakshasa army and huge Vanara army, stood motionless holding their weapons ready. Then, when the mighty human and the Rakshasa were both engaged in the battle, distracted at heart, all experienced supreme wonderment. All the army on both sides lifted their hands up, holding different kinds of implements, and were amazed looking at them and did not attack one another. The army of Rakshasas was looking at Ravana and the Vanaras were looking at Raghava with astonishment as though it was a wonderful picture. Both Ravana and Rama, seeing their portents, firmly resolved in mind with indignation, fought fearlessly. Kakuthsa Rama, sure of his victory and Ravana thinking surely of his death, exhibited their prowess totally in the battle, with determination. Thereafter, valiant ten headed Ravana, fixing arrows released them in anger aiming at the flag post of Rama's chariot. Those arrows, without reaching the post on Indra's chariot, touching the chariot fell on ground. Valiant Rama too stretching his bow in anger and thinking of returning back blow to Ravana and started compliance. Rama, intolerant like a snake, targeting Ravana's post, released a sharp bright glowing arrow. Glorious Rama aiming at the flag post of Ravana, released an arrow that tore the post and went into the ground. Ravana's flag post fell down, struck by Rama. Mighty Ravana, observing his post being struck, became intolerant, and burning in anger, laughing, rained showers of arrows at Rama out of fury. Ravana's flag post fell down, struck by Rama. Mighty Ravana, observing his post being struck, became intolerant, and burning in anger, laughing, rained showers of arrows at Rama out of fury. Ravana with his burning arrows pierced Rama's horses. Those horses were wonderful as they did not stagger or reel as if hurt by lotus stalks and remained complacent. Ravana perceived that the horses were just unperturbed by his arrows, became enraged and showered arrows excessively. Ravana used maces, iron bars, discuses, clubs, mountain peaks, trees and also tridents and axes. Unwearied at heart, Ravana let loose rain of arrows created by magic in thousands. In that war, noisy, alarming, fearful loud noise of weapons of different kinds, in huge numbers, descended. Obstructed by Raghava's chariot on all sides, the arrows covered the Vanara army and up to the sky. Seeing the ten headed Ravana releasing arrows with enthusiasm, not thinking of anything in his mind, quickly Kakuthsa laughed at them, fixed pointed arrows, and released hundreds and thousands. Seeing the ten headed Ravana releasing arrows with enthusiasm, not thinking of anything in his mind, quickly Kakuthsa laughed at them, fixed pointed arrows, and released hundreds and thousands. Seeing the arrows in the sky released by Rama, even Ravana released arrows up to the sky. With the arrows released by both of them, the space became resplendent and by the network of arrows covering it seemed like another sky. Seeing the arrows in the sky released by Rama, even Ravana released arrows up to the sky. With the arrows released by both of them, the space became resplendent and by the network of arrows covering it seemed like another sky. The arrows released by both Rama and Ravana were without result. None failed to reach the target. None failed to complete the target. The arrows were colliding with one another and fell on the ground. Discharging from right and left, the two heroes without break vehemently released dreadful arrows that covered the sky and left no breathing space between them. Ravana struck Rama's horses and Rama struck Ravana's horses blow to blow at that time. Both became furious in that way and the best duel took place for a moment that was fierce and horipulating.",
                "As Rama and Ravana were thus fighting in war, all beings watched with astonishment in mind. Both of them were moving quickly seeking to gain one another, very furiously persevering. Both striking one another diligently, going in circles moving forward and backward displaying feats, went on. Ravana hurting Rama and vice versa displaying quickness in retaliation and speed of arrows, the fight happened. The network of arrows released by both of them from the chariots were like water streams from two clouds in the battlefield Then those two, having seen many movements, once again stood facing each other in the battlefield. The two chariots stood facing each other on the battlefield once more, the axle of one chariot facing the axle of another chariot, the flag of one with another flag, the standard with another standard, the face of one horse with the face of another horse stood and it seemed as though they were together. Thereupon, Rama, stretching the bow, released four sharp glowing arrows at Ravana's four horses and drove them back. Fallen prey to anger for retreating the horses, the ten headed Ravana released pointed arrows on Raghava. Raghava, though wounded by the mighty Ravana's arrows, did notexperience suffering or agitation, nor disquiet. The ten headed Ravana with his thunderbolt like hands hurled arrows and struck the charioteer of Rama, making sounds like thunder. Even though the arrows fell on Matali's body at great speed, he did not feel perturbed or experience even slight suffering. Rama was furious for tormenting Matali like that, but not for hurting him and in fury discharged a network of arrows on him (Ravana) and diverted him. Heroic Raghava thereafter, let loose shafts in twenties, thirties, sixties, hundreds, and thousands at Ravana's chest. Enraged Ravana, the king of Rakshasas, also in return, retaliated with maces and mallets. Once again ensued a tumultuous war fought with maces, mallets, and iron bars, caused hair to stand and the resound of the speed of weapons caused agitation in the seven seas. Once again ensued a tumultuous war fought with maces, mallets, and iron bars, caused hair to stand and the resound of the speed of weapons caused agitation in the seven seas. By the agitation and sounds in the seas, all the Danavas and snakes in thousands inhabiting the seas got distressed. The entire globe with its mountains, gardens and forests shook, the Sun lost his radiance, even the wind did not blow. Thereafter, the Gandharvas, Devas, Siddhas, great sages, Kinneras and huge serpents all of them became anxious. \"May the hosts of sages, Devas, cows and brahmanas be auspicious. May all the worlds endure forever. May Rama conquer Ravana, the Rakshasa king,\" chanting in that manner all witnessed the terrific war between Rama and Ravana that caused hair to stand. \"May the hosts of sages, Devas, cows and brahmanas be auspicious. May all the worlds endure forever. May Rama conquer Ravana, the Rakshasa king,\" chanting in that manner all witnessed the terrific war between Rama and Ravana that caused hair to stand.

Gandharvas and Apsaras watching the combination of Rama and Ravana fighting an unimaginable war said that sky is its own analogue for sky, sea is its own analogue to sea, in the same way is the struggle between Rama and Ravana is unique like Rama and Ravana's struggle and looked at the combat. Then the mighty armed Raghava, enhancer of glory, in wrath like a venomous snake, fitting the bow with arrows cut off the head of Ravana graced with shining earrings. Then the three worlds witnessed the head cut off and fallen on the earth surface. Then the mighty armed Raghava, enhancer of glory, in wrath like a venomous snake, fitting the bow with arrows cut off the head of Ravana graced with shining earrings. Then the three worlds witnessed the head cut off and fallen on the earth surface. A similar looking head arose on Ravana's head. Rama, endowed with a quick hand, cut off by his hand the other head. Before cutting that second head of Ravana again another head appeared. Rama cut off the afore said head with Indra's thunderbolt like arrows. In that way equally charming a hundred heads were struck off. Rama, knower of all shastras, valiant, enhancer of Kausalya's joy, well versed in the use of weapons, was not able to see the end of Ravana's life. He started thinking. 'Earlier, by my arrows, Maricha was killed, Dushana and Khara were killed, Kabhanda was killed in Krauncha forest, Virada was killed in Dandaka forest. By which arrows Sala trees were cut off, mountain was broken, ocean was agitated, and Vali was killed, are wasted with Ravana, who is less brilliant in war. What is the reason?' 'Earlier, by my arrows, Maricha was killed, Dushana and Khara were killed, Kabhanda was killed in Krauncha forest, Virada was killed in Dandaka forest.

Even though Raghava was thinking so, yet remaining alert in the duel, rained arrows on Ravana's chest. Valiant enemy of Raghava also seated in the chariot, rained three hundred, sixties, hundreds, and thousands of arrows. Great war commenced in the sky, as well as on the earth, and on top of mountain again, which was horipulating, The Devas, Danavas, Yakshasas also the fiends Demon, Nagas and Rakshasas watched the great war that continued for seven days and nights. The fight between Rama and Ravana continued all day and night, without stopping for a moment.",
                "Matali reminded Rama in this way,\" O heroic Rama, why are you doing this way, as if you do not know?\" \"O king! As spoken by Suras, the destruction of Ravana has come now. Use the missile of the creator Brahma.\" Suggested and reminded by Matali, valiant Sri Rama seized hold of the wonderful glowing arrow, bestowed by Brahma, and given by the divine to sage Agastya first. Breathing heavily, like a serpent, Rama seized the arrow. Suggested and reminded by Matali, valiant Sri Rama seized hold of the wonderful glowing arrow, bestowed by Brahma, and given by the divine to sage Agastya first. Breathing heavily, like a serpent, Rama seized the arrow. Earlier, this powerful arrow was created for Indra's sake by Brahma and was bestowed to Indra, the king of gods, who was desirous of conquering the three worlds. The wind god presided over its feathers, the fire god and the Sun god presided over its head, its energy was presided over by Meru and Mandara mountains and its weight by the sky. Its form was shining with feathers, decked with gold, splendid with all elements and brilliant like the sun. Like fire at the time of dissolution of the universe, burning like venomous serpent, capable of splitting hosts of enemy, men, elephants, and horses and quick in action. Capable of splitting gateways, iron bars, even mountains, smeared with blood and brain marrow of various Asuras, of dreadful appearance. Strong as thunderbolt, loud sounding, dispersing every deceitful kind of army, frightening to all kinds of beings, hissing like a serpent. In war, it provides food for buzzards, vultures, and herons, and also jackals and Rakshasas, causing terror in the form of Yama (God of death). Provides delight for Vanara chiefs, causes destruction of Rakshasas, provides picturesque plumes of eagles to arrows. The great arrow, was a dispeller of fear of enemies to Ikshvaku kings, which takes away the glory of enemies, delighting to oneself, chanting vedas as per tradition, charging with mystic power, mighty strong Rama fitted to the bow. The great arrow, was a dispeller of fear of enemies to Ikshvaku kings, which takes away the glory of enemies, delighting to oneself, chanting vedas as per tradition, charging with mystic power, mighty strong Rama fitted to the bow. As Raghava started fixing his excellent arrow, all beings got terrified and the earth shook. Rama, provoked by anger, stretched the bow to full length, very well prepared, released the arrow on Ravana, which was capable of tearing into the vital parts. Like the thunderbolt hurled by the arm of Indra, difficult to obstruct, capable of bringing life to an end, that arrow released by Rama penetrated into Ravana's chest. Loosed at high velocity, that arrow capable of putting an end to the body, split as under the heart of evilminded Ravana That arrow which was capable of putting an end to the body took out Ravana's life and smeared with blood, it entered the earth. That arrow of Rama, on killing Ravana, soaked in blood, having accomplished the task quietly reentered its quiver. Thus, when Ravana was killed and lost his life, the bow and arrow in his hand also fell along with his life breath. The king of Rakshasas, who possessed terrific speed and courage, having lost life, fell on earth like Vrttra struck down by thunderbolt. Seeing their Lord killed and fallen on the ground, the leftover night rangers fled all over in fear. Seeing Ravana killed, the Vanaras holding trees went roaming on all sides, feeling triumphant. The Rakshasas hurt by the Vanaras, lost battle and their king killed, were piteous and went towards Lanka in fear, eyes filled with tears. Then the Vanaras, feeling triumphant, got highly excited over Rama's victory and the death of Ravana, and shouted aloud in joy. And then thirty drums of gods sounded in the sky. Divine fragrant pleasant breeze blew. Then from heaven, a very pleasing shower of flowers, difficult to know from where, fell on Raghava's chariot covering it and dropped on the ground. The gods too praised Sri Rama, the great soul saying, 'Well done, Well done', from the heaven, which was distinctly heard. When Ravana, a terror of all worlds was killed, the Charanas and Devas were filled with great joy. The foremost of the Rakshasas killed, Raghava was pleased and having fulfilled the desire of Sugriva, Angada, Vibheeshana, he made them happy. Then the host of gods attained tranquil, quarters brightened, sky became clear, earth no longer shook, wind blew and even the Sun became steady and radiant. Then all of them (hosts of gods) coming together, accompanied by Lakshmana, Sugriva, Vibheeshana, and Angada along with other friends, happy about the victory in the battle offered prayers to charming Sri Rama in accordance with tradition.",

He is of terrible prowess, of extraordinary enthusiasm and fought without any fear and fallen.\" \"Those kings who follow duty steadfast, desiring advancement, fearless in the battlefield, who die in that way should not be mourned.\" \"He who is wise, and the three worlds fear him, including Indra, the Lord of gods, when brought under the sway of death according to timespirit, should not be mourned.\" \"Not only that, in war, he will only will be victorious is not true now or before.

Warrior killed in war is not to be mourned', is true.\" In principle, in that way, decide the action, freed from grief, considering what action is required.\" Having spoken that way by the valiant prince to Vibheeshana, who was immersed in grief, spoke to Rama for the good of his brother. \"He who has not been defeated in battle by even gods or Indra combined together in a trial of strength has been routed by you like the flow of the ocean divides on reaching the shore.\" \"He bestowed gifts to mendicants, nurtured dependents, filled his friends with wealth, and held grudges against enemies and destroyed them.\" \"He maintained sacrificial fire and practised austerities.

                "On seeing Ravana killed by the great soul Raghava, the Rakshasas from the gynaeceum stricken with grief rushed out. Numerous women, though obstructed, were rolling in dust, with dishevelled hair and crying like cows which had lost their calves. The Rakshasa women along with Rakshasas came out of the north gate and entered the battlefield screaming 'O son', 'O husband' and crying, seeing the trunks soaked in blood and mud on the ground and went about all over. The Rakshasa women along with Rakshasas came out of the north gate and entered the battlefield screaming 'O son', 'O husband' and crying, seeing the trunks soaked in blood and mud on the ground and went about all over. Bellowing like female elephants that had lost their husbands, the women roared eyes filled with tears on account of grief for their husbands. They looked at the gigantic body of Ravana of extraordinary valour, full of splendor, killed and lying like a heap of dark mountain on the ground. In the battlefield they saw their husband lying, and precipitately fell on his limbs like broken creepers in a garden. Indeed, out of respect some embraced him and roared aloud, some held his feet and wept, some held his neck and started weeping. Some lifting their arms threw themselves on ground, some rolled, some beholding the dead Ravana's face became deluded. One held his head on her lap, and one held his face and looking at it shed tears, like nature covers lotus with dew and roared. Afflicted on beholding their husband Ravana, killed, and lying on the ground, the Rakshasa women again and again cried exceedingly in many ways overcome with grief. \"By whom Indra feared, by whom Yama feared, at whom king Visrava feared, by whom Pushpaka was deprived to Kubera in war, by whom Gandharvas and ascetics were afraid of, by whom high souled Suras were afraid of lies in the battlefield asleep.\" \"By whom Indra feared, by whom Yama feared, at whom king Visrava feared, by whom Pushpaka was deprived to Kubera in war, by whom Gandharvas and ascetics were afraid of, by whom high souled Suras were afraid of lies in the battlefield asleep.\" \"He, who did not know fear from Asuras or Uragas, experienced fear from a mortal.\" \"He, whom Devatas, Danavas and Rakshasas could not kill, lies asleep, killed by a mortal who came by walk.\" \"He, who could not be killed by Suras, Asuras or Yakshas, such a hero lies like a weak person devoid of strength, killed by a mortal, is resting.\" Those women grieving in that way roared aloud, lamenting again and again cried, afflicted by sorrow. \"You did not listen to the good advice of your dear and good at heart. You brought Sita and destroyed yourself and all of us at a time.\" \"Even though good advice was given by your dear brother Vibheeshana, in your delusion evidently you sought your own destruction.\" \"If Sita, princess of Mithila had been returned by you, this great destruction of the very root and calamity with you and for us would not have happened.\" \"If your brother's desire had been fulfilled Rama would have turned to be our friend. We would not have been widows. Our enemy's desire would not have been fulfilled.\" \"With evil intention you kept Sita under detention. These Rakshasas and you and us all the three are together destroyed.\" \"O Foremost of Rakshasas! You have acted according to your desire alone is not sufficient as divine will make you do everything. He is killed whom destiny kills.\" \"O mighty armed Ravana! For Vanaras, Rakshasas and you too, this destruction in this war has come by divine grace.\" \"In the world, to change the divine course of action, it is not possible with wealth, or will or by prowess or king's orders.\"",
                "Then from among the wives lamenting, the first wife, dear to Ravana gazed at her husband lamenting piteously. Looking at her husband Ravana killed by Rama of inconceivable exploits, Mandodari piteously lamented there. \"O mighty armed Ravana! O, brother of Visrava!

Just by Rama, a mortal, you have been killed in war. Are you not shy of it?\" \"Winning the three worlds by your valour, you are glorious, irresistible and beyond reach. How did the wanderer in the forest strike you?\" \"You lived in an inaccessible place and are capable of assuming any form at will. It is not believable how you have been destroyed by Rama.\" \"You are always well equipped with the army, so such action (killing you) is not possible for Rama.\" \" At Janasthana your brother Khara, who was surrounded by many Rakshasas, was killed by a mortal in the same manner.\" \"To Lanka, which is inaccessible to anyone, Hanuman entered by increasing his valour. Knowing this we worried (that Rama may not be mere mortal).\" \"When these terrific Vanaras constructed a bridge over the great ocean, I doubted in my mind at that time itself that Rama is not a mortal.\" \"Or else, the god of death would have come in the form of Rama for your destruction, having right knowledge and taking an inconceivable recourse. \"Or else O king of extraordinary might!

Speaking about the highly respected Raghava's prowess, the end of dreadful Ravana, the good fighting of Vanaras, counsel of Sugriva, valour of Hanuman, love of Lakshmana, fidelity of Sita, all rejoiced and returned as they had come. Bidding farewell to Matali joyously, honourable Raghava returned the aerial chariot bestowed to him by Indra. Matali, charioteer of Indra too taking Raghava's permission went to heaven in that wonderful chariot. \"On Matali ascending to heaven, Raghava very dearly embraced Sugriva for his help in his victory.\" On embracing Sugriva, greeted by Lakshmana, and worshipped by the army of Vanaras, Rama returned to the camp. And then, Kakuthsa spoke to Saumithri, of auspicious nature and endowed richly with prowess, who stood close by. \"Gentle Lakshmana! Vibheeshana is friendly to me and devoted. He has done me good work in the past. Consecrate him in Lanka.\" \"O gentle Lakshmana! I desire to see this Vibheeshana, Ravana's brother, consecrated at Lanka\" Great selfRaghava having spoken like that, Saumithri, very happily arranged to get a golden vessel. Commanded like that, Lakshmana, endowed with mighty prowess placed that vessel in the hands of Vanara chief, who was endowed with the speed of the mind, to get water from the ocean. Then the foremost of the Vanaras, endowed with the speed of mind, with all speed went and got water from the ocean. Vibheeshana was made to sit on an excellent seat, surrounded by hosts of friends and dear ones. Thereafter, in the midst of Rakshasas chanting sacred verses in accordance with scriptures, Saumithri took a vessel of water and duly consecrated Vibhishana with the water in the vessel as commanded by Rama, in Lanka. Vibheeshana was made to sit on an excellent seat, surrounded by hosts of friends and dear ones. Thereafter, in the midst of Rakshasas chanting sacred verses in accordance with scriptures, Saumithri took a vessel of water and duly consecrated Vibhishana with the water in the vessel as commanded by Rama, in Lanka. Thereafter all the Rakshasas and Vanaras also consecrated with extreme joy and paid tribute to Rama alone. Seeing Vibheeshana consecrated and becoming a king of Lanka, all his ministers and devotees felt rejoiced. Vibheeshana felt extreme felicity for attaining the kingdom given by great Rama with Lakshmana. Consoling the subjects of the kingdom with good words, Vibheeshana sought Rama's presence. The people were very happy and brought curds, yellow rice grains (rice mixed with turmeric), flowers and sweets and parched grain and offered. Consoling the subjects of the kingdom with good words, Vibheeshana sought Rama's presence. The people were very happy and brought curds, yellow rice grains (rice mixed with turmeric), flowers and sweets and parched grain and offered. Valiant Vibheeshana, who is difficult to encounter, presented the benign offerings and auspicious ones received by him to Rama and Lakshmana. Rama having accomplished the task, thoughtfully pleased did not desire for the offerings, accepted them to please Vibheeshana. Then Rama, seeing a heroic mountain like Hanuman, who stood there in supplicant mood greeting him with joined palms, spoke these words. \"O Gentle Hanuman! Taking the permission of the great king Vibheeshana, entering the city of Lanka, enquire the wellbeing of Mythili.\" \"Convey to Vaidehi that me and Lakshman and also Sugriva are doing well, and that Ravana has been killed, O Best among the eloquent.\"",
                "Having been commanded, Hanuman offered prayers to Vibheeshana and entered Lanka. The monkey, having sought the permission of Vibheeshana, entered Lanka city. Duly entering the Asoka grove, he attracted the attention of Sita, who was weak with no bath, cheerless, seated at the root of the tree, like Rohini star. After reaching the grove, he greeted Sita with folded palms and stood motionless. The monkey, having sought the permission of Vibheeshana, entered Lanka city.

Duly entering the Asoka grove, he attracted the attention of Sita, who was weak with no bath, cheerless, seated at the root of the tree, like Rohini star. After reaching the grove, he greeted Sita with folded palms and stood motionless. Seeing the mighty Hanuman, who arrived quietly, she was quiet. Then she saw him and experienced joy on recognizing him Gentle Hanuman, the foremost of the monkeys, seeing her started to communicate every word of Rama. Hanuman said\" O Vaidehi! Sri Rama accompanied by Sugriva and Lakshmana, with the help of Vibheeshana, is doing well.\" \"Noble lady! Sri Rama killed Ravana and won the enemy. He accomplished the purpose with the help of Vibheeshana, the valiant Lakshmana and the monkeys also so to speak. He inquired of your wellbeing.\" \"O noble lady! I am communicating delightful news to you. O Sita, a respectable lady and knowledgeable one, the victory is attained in the combat by the great soul Rama, by virtue of your strength and devotion.\" \"O noble lady! I am communicating delightful news to you. O Sita, a respectable lady and knowledgeable one, the victory is attained in the combat by the great soul Rama, by virtue of your strength and devotion.\" 'Ravana has been killed, Lanka is under our side vanquished completely. Without any sleep, with forbearance, building an extensive bridge on the great ocean, the vow has been redeemed', is Rama's message to you, said Hanuman. \"This Lanka is under Vibheeshana, Lord of Lanka. There is no need for perturbation thinking that you are in Ravana's abode.\" \"You be at ease, as you are living in your own abode\", said Hanuman consoling Sita. 'Vibheeshana, who is very happy, is eager and favouring to see you.\" Hanuman having spoken in that way, Sita got up in excessive joy and could not speak naturally. Then seeing Sita not answering him, the monkey chief asked her\" Why are you not replying. What are you thinking?\" When Hanuman spoke in that way virtuous Sita was overwhelmed with joy and spoke with a voice choked with tears. \"No doubt that my husband is victorious is very delightful. Hearing this, I am overcome with delight and am unable to speak for a moment.\" \"Hanuman! However, I think to give you a befitting gift for this happy news. I am not able to see any.\" \"I am not able to see on this earth, a gift befitting the value of your message, which can be given to you to make you happy.\" \"Neither gold or silver or gems, not even kingdom or the three worlds are equal to what you have spoken now.\" Spoken in that way by Vaidehi, Hanuman stood with folded palms in front of Sita and replied in delight. \"You alone can speak such affectionate words in this manner wishing victory and welfare of your dear husband. You are irreproachable.\" \"O gentle one! Your meaningful words full of affection are more valuable than clusters of gems or Indra, the Lord of gods.\" \"Now that the enemy is killed, Rama is happy, which means as if I have attained the rulership of gods.\" Hearing the words of Mythili, daughter of Janaka, Hanuman spoke these auspicious words. Continuing to pay tribute to Hanuman's words, Sita said\" Your language and expression are always richly endowed with virtuous qualities, sweet and valuable, combined with eight excellences. (Eight excellences areKeenness to hear discourses, readiness to hear discourses, receptivity, retentive power, reasoning for a proposition, against a proposition, faculty of comprehension, realization of truth).\" \"You are a praiseworthy son of wind god. In strength, righteousness, valour, vigour, prowess, skill, you are excellent. You are energetic, endowed with tolerance, forbearance, firmness, brilliance, and humility. You alone have many more qualities, no doubt.\" \"You are a praiseworthy son of wind god. In strength, righteousness, valour, vigour, prowess, skill, you are excellent. You are energetic, endowed with tolerance, forbearance, firmness, brilliance, and humility. You alone have many more qualities, no doubt.\" Now with folded palms offering prayers to Sita, Hanuman stood without perturbation, with all humility and again spoke to Sita. \"I desire to kill all those Rakshasas who in the past have intimidated you indeed and whoever threatened you.\" \"O Devi! You, who were so devoted to your husband, were tormented in Asoka grove earlier. These cruel Rakshasas of hideous conduct, of fierce and distorted forms with terrible eyes addressing you in harsh words by Ravana's order, were heard by me.\" \"O Devi! You, who were so devoted to your husband, were tormented in Asoka grove earlier. These cruel Rakshasas of hideous conduct, of fierce and distorted forms with terrible eyes addressing you in harsh words by Ravana's order, were heard by me.\" \"I wish to kill by all kinds of strokes, these cruel distorted forms of Rakshasas having terrible hair and fierce eyes and not to mention their violence. Permit me.\" \"I wish to kill by all kinds of strokes, these cruel distorted forms of Rakshasas having terrible hair and fierce eyes and not to mention their violence. Permit me.\" \"These Rakshasas who have wronged, who are of dreadful appearance, I wish to hit them with fists, with feet spreading long arms, strike with blows of shanks and knees, with teeth, and torment by pulling their ears and nose.

I would like to kill the terrible forms of ogres who threatened you, in that way, I will be at and strike in many ways and destroy them\", said Hanuman to Sita. Hanuman having spoken like that, Sita who was fond of the desperate, thus spoke to Hanuman thinking for a while. \"Foremost of Vanaras! Who will be angry? Being under the command of the king and being obedient maids, they did so according to king's order. \"Mighty Armed Hanuman! Do not speak in this manner. It was my fate which was supreme. Because of my predetermined circumstances I reaped such a result. I am feeblehearted and condone the maids surely.\" \"By Ravana's order they threatened me so. Now with his death, they will not be threatening me.\" \"O Monkey! In olden days a bear had uttered a verse which conforms to righteousness. I shall tell you now.\" \"Sinners or noble men, having done a wrong deed and deserve death. Also noble, will show compassion and not commit harm.\" \"Rakshasas by nature are cruel in their deeds and can assume any form according to their will. No sinful actions to be done even if they do sinful actions.\" Sita, having spoken that way to Hanuman, he, who was capable of good expression, replied as follows to Rama's consort, who was irreproachable. \"Devi! you are the righteous wife of Rama and earned fame. Give me the right message to Rama in return. I will go.\" Hanuman, having spoken that way to Vaidehi, daughter of Janaka, she said\" I desire to see my husband.\" On hearing Mythili, wise Hanuman spoke these words to her bringing joy to her. \"Now you will see Sri Rama whose countenance resembles the moon, with Lakshmana, with friends who are alive, with friends whose enemies are gone, just as Sachi, the consort of Indra, the Lord of gods saw.\" Hanuman reached Raghava with extraordinary speed assuring Sita, who shone like Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, and had spoken like that.",
                "Highly learned Hanuman greeted and spoke meaningfully to Rama, the foremost among the wielders of bow. \"You ought to see that noble lady Mythili, who was immersed in grief, for whose sake these actions were started and has borne fruit.\" \"Mythili who is overcome with grief on hearing your victory, was filled with tears in her eyes and desired to see you.\" \"In an earlier occasion having known me and trusting me expressed that she desires to see Rama with Lakshmana after victory and with gratitude.\" When Hanuman had spoken like that, Rama, the upholder of righteousness, shed tears slightly and suddenly became thoughtful. Drawing a long hot breath, looking at the ground, he spoke to Vibheeshana, who was like a cloud standing there. When Rama had spoken in that manner, Vibheeeshana for his part hastened to the Gynaeceum and assigned through the women to convey to Sita. Then Vibheeshana, the prosperous Lord of the Rakshasas seeing Sita greeted her with palms joined together lifted it over his head (as a sign of respect). \"Vaidehi! Anointed with a wonderful fragrance, decked with beautiful ornaments, auspicious and ascending the palanquin, your husband desires to see you.\" Vibheeshana, having spoken that way, Vaidehi said to the Lord of Rakshasas that she would like to see him without having a bath. Hearing Sita's words Vibheeshana replied saying,\" You will and ought to do what your husband Rama has said.\" Noble Mythili (on hearing Vibheeshana), who looked upon her husband as God, said in reply, 'Alright'. Thereafter Vibheeshana, making Sita to ascend the palanquin, covered with valuable clothes and guarded by numerous Rakshasas after she adorned herself in the best of ornaments and put on glowing wonderful clothes brought to Rama. Thereafter Vibheeshana, making Sita to ascend the palanquin, covered with valuable clothes and guarded by numerous Rakshasas after she adorned herself in the best of ornaments and put on glowing wonderful clothes brought to Rama. Knowing that Sita reached also, great Rama was seen in a meditative mood absorbed in thought. Vibheeshana announced saying, 'Sita has been brought' and greeted with folded palms, full of joy. On hearing that Sita had arrived, who stayed in Rakshasa's abode for long, Raghava had experienced joy, indignation, and anger, all the three at the same time. Raghava, analysed with in him, distressed and thinking deeply, seeing Vibheeshana close by, spoke these words. \"O gentle Vibheeshana, let Sita who sought my victory always be quickly brought near me.\" On hearing Raghava's words, faithful Vibheeshana instantly assigned people to disperse from there. Then those who were wearing coats and turbans, holding staffs in hand, warriors started moving and dispersed. The hordes of Bears, Vanaras and Rakshasas moving about all over there were driven away to a distance from the vicinity. The great sound heard there was like the uproar of an ocean lashed by a storm. Seeing them excited to know and dispersing, Raghava stopped them out of kindness. Exhibiting anger with his gaze at the uproar, Rama addressed the highly intelligent Vibheeshana resenting their action. \"Why are these people being troubled without disregard for me? Stop this excitement. They are my own people.\" \"For women it is not the house, boundary wall or clothes or protective wall or screen of cloth or even this kind of royal treatment or surrounding, is the protection.\" \"The appearance of a woman in public is not condemned in times of difficulty, in straits, in conflicts, in the selection of a husband, or in sacrificial ceremonies or marriage ceremonies.\" \"Sita is in distress and in a highly miserable situation. Her appearance is no fault especially in my presence.\" \"Therefore, leaving the palanquin let Vaidehi walk on foot only towards me with the help of these Vanaras.\" Rama having spoken clearly in that way, Vibheeshana reverently conducted Sita to Rama. There upon Lakshmana, Sugriva, and Vanara Hanuman, astonished at Rama's statement, became highly distressed. Seeing Rama having no regard towards Sita, and his harsh gestures, Lakshmana and Sugriva discussed if Rama was displeased with Sita? Mythili, also adopting modesty, shrinking into her own limbs, approached her husband followed by Vibheeshana. Sita, a gentle lady, who considered her husband as God only wondered with a mixed feeling of joy and affection and looked at the gentle face of Rama.",
                "Observing Mythili who stood near him, Rama started to give expression to what was in his heart. \"O Auspicious Sita! You are won by destruction of the enemy in the battlefield. What was worth doing has been done with all my effort.\" \"I have put an end to the indignity that I lost. I gained reward for the insult. The indignity offered by the enemy has been wiped out all at once.\" \"Now you see the result of my effort. I am successful and fulfilled my vow. Today I am independent.\" \"When you were alone you were abducted by the fickle minded Rakshasa. The fault of destiny has been won by me, a mortal by the will of god\" \"What is the purpose of might however great he might be, if he is petty minded and does not wipe off the insult?\" \"Hanuman's leaping across the ocean and devastating action of Lanka has yielded results now.\" \"The prowess of Sugriva and also his army, his good advice and efforts in combat have become successful.\" \"In the same way even Vibheeshana's hard work leaving his brother devoid of good qualities and coming to me on his own has given success.\" Sita's broad eyes which were like that of female deer were filled with tears on hearing the words of Rama. Rama was already hurt and on seeing Sita who was dear to his heart nearby, he was burning with the fear of public opinion. In the midst of Vanaras and Rakshasas, Rama spoke with great discomfort to Sita whose eyes were like lotus petals and hair was dark and curly and whose limbs were beautiful. \"That which my mind desired as a duty of a human being, to get rid of the insult has been done by killing Ravana.\" \"Though the southern quarter is difficult to assail for the world of mortals, Agastya, a realized sage, has won by the power of his austerity. In the same way I have won you.\" \"Sita! This effort in carrying out with the assistance of valiant friends is not done for your sake. Let it be known to you. I have done this to protect good conduct and my illustrious race from scandal and rid of obloquy from all sides.\" \"Sita! This effort in carrying out with the assistance of valiant friends is not done for your sake. Let it be known to you. I have done this to protect good conduct and my illustrious race from scandal and rid of obloquy from all sides.\" \"In the event of doubtful conduct also you are standing firmly like a glowing lamp for me suffering from sore eyes and disagreeable to me.\" \"O Janaka's daughter! therefore now you are permitted to go wherever to any quarter. Let you be auspicious. I have no work with you.\" \"Which eminent man born in a good race will again consciously accept a wife who lived in another's home?\" \"You are thrown out of the arms of Ravana. You have been seen by him with lustful eyes, have been seen by all with evil eyes. How can one born in a great race accept you again?\" \"The reason for winning you back is to get rid of the insult. Now I have no interest in you. You may go to the place of your choice.\" \" Auspicious one! This utterance has been thought over well today. You may go wherever you find happiness, either to Lakshmana or else to Bharata. Think well and do.\" \"Sita! You can go to Shatrughna or else Sugriva or even Rakshasa Vibheeshana, wherever you feel like to live.\" \"Sita! You are endowed with beauty and having you in his own house for so long and seeing you, how Ravana could have resisted or detained you.\"",
                "Vaidehi heard the harsh horripilating words spoken by Rama in anger and was very much afflicted. Then Mythili hearing her husband 's harsh words, in the presence of a large number of people, stayed bent with shyness. As if pierced by those arrowlike words, Janaka's daughter shed tears excessively, shrinking into her own limbs. Thereafter, wiping her face clean from flowing tears she spoke slowly in a choked voice in broken words to her husband. \"Hero! Why are you addressing me in such harsh unkind words in a rude manner, in a harsh tone like a common man?\" \"O Mighty armed! I am not as you think of me, so also show me a proof of it in my past. I swear on my past.\" \"You give up judging all womankind by the path followed by vulgar women. You give up these doubts if you have examined.\" \"O Lord! I was helpless when Ravana contacted my limbs in the past. I was not acting according to my will. My fate is to be blamed and not me.\" \"That mind which is under my control is my heart and it abides in you. What can I do about my limbs when I am at others' mercy?\" \"Honourable Rama! If I am not understood by you despite our growing up together with love and in spite of our intimate relationship, I am done forever.\" \"King! When the great hero Hanuman was sent by you to find me in Lanka, why did you not leave me then.\" \"O hero! Had you given me up immediately on receiving your message from Vanara I would have given up my life in the presence of Hanuman there itself.\" \"O Life! If you had a doubt this exertion to you is wasteful. This fruitless hard work was perhaps not required on your part nor your friends.\" \"O tiger among kings! You also gave up yourself to anger like a weak man and adopted womanliness\" \"When in my young age you held my hand as a mark of acceptance (in our marriage), has it not been considered by you? Has my devotion, character and chastity not been taken into account?\" Thus speaking, and weeping with tears, with choked throat, Sita was absorbed in her mind and piteous. She spoke to Lakshmana. \"Saumithri! Cure for this sorrow is only pyre. Arrange for pyre as I do not desire to live with false reproaches.\" \"When my husband is not pleased with my virtues, renounces me in the gathering of people, I have only that path for me, that is, entering fire and offering myself as oblation.\" Spoken in that manner by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemies, overcome with indignation looked at Raghava. Understanding Rama's indication from his looks, Saumithri started to prepare the earth for pyre. Indeed, no friend or dear could see or speak or make a request or pacify Rama. at that time. Thereafter, Vaidehi, walking clockwise near Rama went round him in accordance with tradition and approached the pyre. Mythili greeted the gods and brahmanas with joined palms and went near fire and again joined her palms in greeting and spoke as follows. \"If it is true that my heart has never slid from Raghava at all, may the fire god protect me always and so also the world witness.\" \"If in Rama's view, I am of impeccable conduct and so also if what he is seeing is not known to be true, let the world witness and fire god protect me.\" 'If I have ever acted or been unfaithful at heart or in speech and did not follow a righteous path with Rama, who is a knower of all virtues, let the fire god protect me.\" \"O gods! Supreme Aditya, wind god, god of the four quarters, and also by moon, and gods presiding during day, night, twilight and so also earth, know me as a woman of good character, let the fire god protect me that way.\" Having spoken in that way, Vaidehi went round fire fearlessly, absorbed with in herself and entered the flaming and burning fire. Young and old assembled there, and the gathering of people witnessed Mythili entering the flaming and burning fire. Like freshly polished gold, like shining gold ornament, in the presence of the whole world she fell into flaming and glowing fire. All created beings and forms witnessed large eyed Sita descending on the golden altar, into the fire like goddess of fortune descending on her vehicle. All the three worlds witnessed noble dark Sita entering the fire, like ghee offered to fire. All the women who stood there fled, screaming on seeing Sita falling into fire, like the flow of ghee poured continuously into sacrificial fire reciting sacred verses by priests. All the Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas of the three worlds who witnessed her falling, extolled her as if goddess was falling from heaven into hell.",

You with your brother Lakshmana offer your salutations to him.\" Raghava along with Lakshmana offered salutations to his father seated on top of the aerial chariot after listening to Lord MahaDeva. Raghava with his younger brother Lakshmana saw his father who was effulgent, blazing and adorned in white clothes. Then Dasaratha, the ruler of the world, seated in an elevated seat in the aerial car, seeing his son who was dearer than life to him, extremely rejoiced and made Raghava sit on his lap, embraced him, and started speaking as follows. Then Dasaratha, the ruler of the world, seated in an elevated seat in the aerial car, seeing his son who was dearer than life to him, extremely rejoiced and made Raghava sit on his lap, embraced him, and started speaking as follows. \"Rama separated from you, even the suras and sages honouring me in heaven does not give me happiness. It is true and I promise.\" \"Today the enemies are killed, and you have completed the exile. I am fully satisfied and experiencing joyfulness on seeing you.\" \"Those utterances of Kaikeyi with a motive to send you on exile are still hurting my heart, O Best among speakers!\" \"Seeing you with Lakshmana and embracing you makes me happy freed from grief just as the sun freed from mist.\" \"Son! I am liberated by you today, my great son, just as Kahola who was set on righteousness was liberated by Ashtavakra.\" \"O gentle son! I did not know that the ruler of gods had sent you for the destruction of Ravana, O excellent one.\" \"Rama! Kausalya will see you, as an accomplished one, as a destroyer of enemies, on returning home from the forest and will be highly rejoiced.\" \"On reaching the city and consecrated in the kingdom as ruler of the world, people will see you as an accomplished person.\" \"I desire to see you reunited with mighty Bharata who is pure and follower of dharma.\" \"O Gentle Rama! Fourteen years have been spent in the forest with Sita and Lakshmana after my departure from life.\" \"The period of your exile has been completed, my promise has been fulfilled in the battlefield and the gods have also gratified you.\" Dasaratha having spoken to Rama, offered salutations with joined palms and said,\" You are righteous. Be gracious to Bharata and Kaikeyi also.\" \"O Lord! You had spoken in such a way saying 'I disown a good son and Kaikeyi' and cursed. May that dreadful curse not touch your son and Kaikeyi,\" said Rama. The king (Dasharatha) saying 'so be it' and embracing Lakshmana again and saluting Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows. \"You have served with devotion to Rama and Sita and made me very happy. By this task you have earned the merit of righteousness.\" \"O knower of dharma! If Rama is pleased, extensive fame as well as heaven and supreme glory will be attained on this earth.\" \"O Lakshmana, the enhancer of Sumithra's joy, 'Be auspicious. Rama will always remain good in the service of the three worlds.\" \"This Indra and also Siddhas, supreme sages who are great souls pay respects to Rama and worship him.\" \"O Gentle! Rama, the tormentor of enemies is the unmanifest and imperishable secret, is Brahma alone. This is created by Brahma. It is the secret in the heart of gods.\" \"Videha's Sita, you have also earned fame by serving Rama with devotion and following the righteous path.\" Having spoken like that to Lakshmana, looking at the daughter in law standing there with folded palms, Dasaratha addressed her saying,\" Daughter\", gently and sweetly and said. \"In the event of Rama abandoning you, resentment should not be shown in this way. It is your duty to endure. Rama himself has done this to prove your purity.\" \"Daughter! that which you have done is a sign of your character. It is highly difficult to do. You will overshadow the future of other women.\" \"You need not be told about the service to your husband. Nevertheless, I am giving instruction. This Rama is supreme god for you.\" Having admonished the two glowing sons, and Sita, Dasaratha went by aerial car to the world of Indra.",
                "Mahendra, the tamer of demon Paka, spoke very affectionately to Rama, who stood with joined palms before Dasharatha who had returned. \"O Rama, a bull among men! Your sight was amazing, and we are happy. Please tell us the desire in your mind?\" Gratified by Mahendra's words, Raghava was very happy and pleased, submitting to him as follows. \"O Lord of gods, you are one who is good at expression. If happiness has risen in, you please make my words true.\" \"The Vanaras have fought for my cause and reached the abode of Yama. Make them rise up and get them back to life.\" \"O honourable Indra! I wish to see all those Vanaras who are separated forever from their sons, and wives for my cause, delighted.\" \"They were valiant and courageous and did not care for life. They did their utmost, died and fell into adversity. Purandara! Get all of them back to life.\" \"They were fond of doing and not counted death. I seek your grace to give a boon to relieve all of them from death.\" \"Bestower of honour! I wish to see the longtailed Vanaras, and Bears rid of pain and death, enriched with strength and courage.\" \"Let the location where Vanaras lived, have flowers, roots, fruits even though out of season and rivers with pure water.\" Hearing high souled Raghava's words, Mahendra in turn replied as follows. \"Dear Rama! that which has been sought by you is great. Nothing has been revised by me in the past. Therefore, everything asked by you will be granted by this boon.\" \"Let those long tailed Vanaras and Bears killed by Rakshasas, whose heads and arms had been severed, duly rise to life.\" The monkeys duly healed, so also from death, enriched with strength and power rose up like rising from sleep. \"Let all in that way happily get reunited and highly rejoiced, with relatives, own clan and own people get united.\" The trees will be with blossoms and fruits even though it is unseasonal. The rivers will remain with waters. All the army of Vanaras healed from the wounds, who were earlier covered with wounds and all the dead monkeys together rose up like getting up from sleep. They were amazed and started saying 'What happened'! Seeing all of them fully accomplished, the best of Suras very affectionately praised Rama and Lakshmana and spoke. \"King, return from here to Ayodhya leaving the monkeys. Reassure Mythili, who is very dear to you and an illustrious one.\" \"Subduer of enemies! See your brothers, great souls Bharata and Satrughna devoted to you who are in grief due to your separation, see your mothers. Get consecrated. People will rejoice. \"Subduer of enemies! See your brothers, great souls Bharata and Satrughna devoted to you who are in grief due to your separation, see your mothers. Get consecrated. People will rejoice. The thousand eyed Indra, having spoken in that way to Rama and Saumithri, delighted, they returned to heaven in an aerial car with Suras. Then greeting all the jewels among gods present there, accompanied by brother Lakshmana, Kakuthsa Rama ordered all Vanaras to go home and rest.",
                "Rising in the morning after comfortable rest that night, Vibheeshana saw Rama the subduer of enemies, offered salutations and asked him of the victory and spoke.

I am your servant and not commanding you to do so.\" On hearing Vibheeshana spoken in the aforesaid manner, Rama replied to the hearing of Rakshasas, Vanaras and all of them there. \"O tormentor of enemies! Hero, I am honoured by your friendship, by your efforts, and good heartedness of all of you.\" \"Ruler of Rakshasas! Not accepting your request will surely not happen. (but) my mind is hastening to see my brother Bharata.\" \"He came to Chitrakuta and on reaching bent down obediently, begged me by his words to return which I did not do.

How can I continue to stay here?\" Rama having spoken that way, Vibheeshana the king of Rakshasas, hurriedly ordered for the aerial car. The aerial car Pushpaka's parts were decorated with golden pictures, its altars were made of cat's eye gems, its squares were fixed with pillars and shone like silver. It was surrounded on all sides with yellow pennons. It had posts and flags all over, decorated with golden lotuses. The mansions in Pushpak had networks scattered with eyeholes set with pearls like windows. It had rows of bells, surrounded on all sides which had sweet sound.

                "Offering to Sri Rama the Pushpak decorated with flowers to sit, Vibheeshana stood at a distance and spoke. The Rakshasa king humbly offered salutation to Raghava with joined palms, quickly approached, and said, 'What is to be done'? Highly brilliant Raghava was thinking and spoke in a friendly manner while Lakshmana was listening closely. \"Let all the forest rangers (without exception) who made effort and fought be duly honoured with valuables and several luxuries.\" \"This Lanka could be won with the help of these heroes who never turned back and fought in comb at without fear of life, O Lord of Rakshasas.\" \"These forest rangers, all of them have struggled and accomplished success. Reward them with wealth and gems.\" \"These helpless monkey troops will be content with gratitude when rewarded, O respectable Vibheeshana.\" \"If you do so you will be called as charitable and kind, not seizing wealth and as one who has gained over senses. That is why I am telling you for so long.\" \"O Ruler of men, all the army will desert a king who is devoid of virtues, lowly and who is a destructor in the battlefield.\" Vibheeshana honoured the Vanaras with gems and valuables, after Rama had spoken like that. Then on seeing the monkey troops being honoured with excellent gemsRama ascended the aerial car.  Illustrious Vaidehi was abashed while she was taken in his(Hanumans) arms to Pushpalata while the valiant archers Lakshmana and his brother were there . After duly honouring all the Vanaras, to Vibheeshana and highly courageous Sugriva, Kakuthsa spoke as follows. \"Bull among Vanaras! Since this work of the friend has been accomplished, you too have my permission to go where you will.\" All that has to be done by an affectionate friend in advanced age has been done, for the fear of unrighteousness. Now you may advance with your army to Kishkinda. \"Vibheeshana, I would like to see you living like Indra bestowed with your own kingdom in Lanka. It will not be possible for even gods to attack you.\" \"I shall proceed to my father's capital, Ayodhya. You may permit me. Be auspicious. I take leave of you.\" After Rama had spoken that way Sugriva, Vibheeshana, monkeys and Rakshasas saluted Rama and said as follows. We wish to proceed with you to Ayodhya, and many wishes to go with you and range the forests and groves without anxiety. \"O Jewel among kings! We will see you being consecrated and see Kausalya, greet her and return back to our own house.\" Vibheeshana and Vanaras had spoken in that way, Rama replied to Sugriva, Vibheeshana and Vanaras as follows. \"If I with my dear and near and together with you go to Ayodhya, that will give more happiness with Sita coming and with all of you.\" Sugriva and the Vanaras, quickly ascended the aerial car. Vibheeshana, the king of Rakshasas and ministers all of them ascended. Then Sugriva with Vanaras happily joined the wonderful Pushpaka, Vibheeshana and his ministers also ascended. All the Vanaras and others having got into Kubera's Pushpaka with Rama's permission, it flew into the sky. Delighted and thrilled, Rama was flying in the sky in Pushpaka and with shining swans, he shone like Kubera.",

I wish to go to the capital city Ayodhya with you, Tara and other consorts of Sugriva, and other women, surrounded by Vanara chiefs.\" Vaidehi having spoken like that, Raghava replied her saying 'So be it' and Raghava stopped Pushpaka at Kishkinda, looked at Sugriva and spoke as follows. \"Sugriva, the tiger among Vanaras! Let all Vanara chiefs and all women too collected, proceed to Ayodhya.

After taking my blessings you proceed to Ayodhya.\" Glorious son of emperor obeying the words of Bharadwaja bending his head in reverence requested for that boon. \"O divine sage! Let all the trees bear fruits out of season of several kinds of many sweet and juicy, tasting nectar appear on our way as we proceed to Ayodhya.\" When Bharadwaja promised saying, 'Be it so' and the trees on all sides grew like heavenly trees. \"Then while we were proceeding for three yojanas on all sides the trees that did not have fruits started bearing fruits, trees that did not have blossoms started having blossoms and the trees that dried up developed leaves and began to shed honey.\"",
                "There upon Raghava who was quick in exhibiting his prowess started thinking with his friends looking at Ayodhya (from Pushpaka). Then wise and energetic Rama, thinking, casting his attention on the Vanaras, spoke to Hanuman. \"Chief of monkeys! Going quickly to the king's mansion in Ayodhya try to find out about the wellbeing of the people.\" \"Go to Sringaberipuram which is seen from the sky, meet Guha the leader of Nishadas and tell him of my inquiry and wellbeing.\" \"He will be very happy to hear that I am in good health free from anxiety. He is equal to me and my friend.\" \"Dear Guha, the king of Nishadas will tell you the way to Ayodhya and Bharata's nature.\" \"Please tell Bharata my words of inquiry of his wellbeing and that having accomplished my purpose I returned with my wife and Lakshmana.\" \"O powerful Hanuman! you may tell him of the abduction of Vaidehi by Ravana, my friendship with Sugriva and killing of Vali in combat.\" \"You may tell him of the search for Mythili by you, crossing the vast never decreasing stretch of water, leaping across and finding Sita.\" \" Also, about my going near ocean and his (Ocean god) appearance before me, construction of the bridge killing of Ravana.\" \" About Mahendra accompanied by Brahma and Varuna bestowing boon and by the grace of Mahadeva and meeting my father.\" \"Gentle Hanuman! tell him about my coming with Sugriva the king of Vanaras, and king of Rakshasas, Vibheeshana.\" \"Tell him that Rama , after conquering hosts of enemies, attaining unsurpassed fame, accomplished his purpose, has returned with mighty friends.\" \"Listening to Bharata, and seeing his form, expression on hearing this news and knowing his intent, checking all this you may return to me.\" \" All the information, everything to be known by his facial colour, expression, by his speech, his intention to be ascertained truly.\" \"Whose mind will not be tempted at the abundance of elephants and horses of father's and grandfather's kingdom?\" \"If the glorious Bharata who is an enhancer of the joy of Raghus having enjoyed the kingdom for long himself, let him rule all the entire earth it is laudable.\" \"Hanuman, making an effort to know his mind you ought to come quickly before we go too far a distance.\" Commanded like that Hanuman went speedily taking human form to Ayodhya. Then Hanuman rose up just like Garuda who goes at great speed to vanquish the best of serpents. Valiant Hanuman, flying through the course of the birds, through the auspicious path of the wind god, leaping across Ganga and Yamuna, reached Sringaberipuram, saw Guha, rejoiced and thus spoke charming words.

He saw waters associated with Parasurama, and rivers Valukini, Varuthini, and Gomathi so also fearful woods of Sala trees and thousands of people, numerous kingdoms on the way. Speeding on the journey for long distance Hanuman, the elephant among the monkeys saw women, their sons, grand sons and the old, well decorated, sporting in the gardens which were like the gardens of Indra and the gardens of Chaitraratha of Kubera with trees and close to Nandigrama, he saw trees full of blossoms.

The citizens (of Ayodhya) who were lovers of virtues did not enjoy any luxuries, not inclined for pleasures as the prince himself was wearing bark of trees and skin of antelope. Maruti's son Hanuman offered salutations to Bharata who was seen like a supreme body of dharma itself as if he was another form of dharma. \"That Kakuthsa for whom you are worrying and living as he was at Dandaka forest with bark tree fabric, and matted hair sent me to tell you about his welfare.\" \"O God! I will tell you some pleasant news. Give up that terrible grief. You will be reunited with your brother this moment.\" \"Rama killed Ravana and recovered Mythili. He, having accomplished the purpose, is coming with his mighty friends.\" \"Lakshmana who is endowed with extraordinary energy, and illustrious Sita accompanied by Rama will be coming as Sachi with Mahendra.\" Hanuman having said that, the son of Kaikeyi was delighted and instantly fell on ground and lost senses by extreme joy. Bharata got up in a moment and saw Hanuman, who is sweet in speech said this. Glorious Bharata was overwhelmed with joy and embraced Hanuman and copious tears of joy born of joy. \"O Gentle Hanuman! You have come here with great compassion. Are you God or a human being?

                "\"I am hearing the good news of my Lord returning from the forest, who was living in the great forest for many years.\" The saying that \"If a human being lives (long), for a hundred years, he will experience joy\" is true and auspicious. \"How did the alliance of monkeys happen with Rama? Where and why? I am asking you. Tell me truly.\" Prince Bharata seated comfortably on kusa grass asked Hanuman for all the history that happened in the forest, wishing to hear from him. \"O Lord, mighty armed Bharata! the boons bestowed on your mother, how Sri Rama went on exile, how king Dasharatha died out of grief of son, envoys bringing you to Ayodhya, entering the kingdom, your unwillingness to accept the sovereignty, going to Chitrakuta mountain, seeking your brother noble Rama, a scourge of enemies to accept the kingdom, renouncing the kingdom by Rama, taking his sandals, and again returning here, all this is known to you.\" \"O Lord, mighty armed Bharata! the boons bestowed on your mother, how Sri Rama went on exile, how king Dasharatha died out of grief of son, envoys bringing you to Ayodhya, entering the kingdom, your unwillingness to accept the sovereignty, going to Chitrakuta mountain, seeking your brother noble Rama, a scourge of enemies to accept the kingdom, renouncing the kingdom by Rama, taking his sandals, and again returning here, all this is known to you.\" \"O Lord, mighty armed Bharata! the boons bestowed on your mother, how Sri Rama went on exile, how king Dasharatha died out of grief of son, envoys bringing you to Ayodhya, entering the kingdom, your unwillingness to accept the sovereignty, going to Chitrakuta mountain, seeking your brother noble Rama, a scourge of enemies to accept the kingdom, renouncing the kingdom by Rama, taking his sandals, and again returning here, all this is known to you.\" \"O Lord, mighty armed Bharata! the boons bestowed on your mother, how Sri Rama went on exile, how king Dasharatha died out of grief of son, envoys bringing you to Ayodhya, entering the kingdom, your unwillingness to accept the sovereignty, going to Chitrakuta mountain, seeking your brother noble Rama, a scourge of enemies to accept the kingdom, renouncing the kingdom by Rama, taking his sandals, and again returning here, all this is known to you.\" \"O Lord, mighty armed Bharata! the boons bestowed on your mother, how Sri Rama went on exile, how king Dasharatha died out of grief of son, envoys bringing you to Ayodhya, entering the kingdom, your unwillingness to accept the sovereignty, going to Chitrakuta mountain, seeking your brother noble Rama, a scourge of enemies to accept the kingdom, renouncing the kingdom by Rama, taking his sandals, and again returning here, all this is known to you.\" \"When you had gone away the beasts and birds scared of your army got agitated and had a doleful appearance.\" \"Then he entered into dreadful Dandaka forest that was devoid of people which was crowded with lions, tigers, and deer, and trampled by the elephants.\" \"That Viradha uplifted his arms and bent his head low screamed like an elephant.

                "Hearing the delightful news, Bharata of truthful prowess, the destroyer of enemies, was very happy and ordered Shatrughna. \"Let all gods in the temples of the capital be worshiped by people purifying themselves, duly adorned with fragrance and garlands.\" \"Let the bards well versed in singing praises, charioteers, all courtesans, in groups, artists who can play musical instruments, similarly ministers, army men, traders, service providers, Kshatriyas, brahmins so also top people, troops proceed to see the moon like face of Rama.\" \"Let the bards well versed in singing praises, charioteers, all courtesans, in groups, artists who can play musical instruments, similarly ministers, army men, traders, service providers, Kshatriyas, brahmins so also top people, troops proceed to see the moon like face of Rama.\" Shatrughna, a destroyer of enemies, hearing the words of Bharata, ordered for many divisions of labour and the courageous ones to come. From here (Nandigrama to Ayodhya) low lying areas are to be made even and uneven areas to be levelled. Let the ground be sprinkled with cold water and then parched grain and flowers to be sprinkled. Let the streets of the foremost of the best cities (Ayodhya), be decorated with flags till the sun rises and houses be decorated. Let hundreds of people decorate with fragrant garlands of five colours closely tied and decorate the royal paths. On hearing Shatrughna's command, all the eight ministers, Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, and Mantrapala issued forth with great joy. On hearing Shatrughna's command, all the eight ministers, Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, and Mantrapala issued forth with great joy. Seated on top of thousands of well decorated elephants in rut, and on the best of horses, people went (to receive Rama). Female elephants had golden girths on their waist. Best charioteers on best chariots proceeded. Chiefs on horses, champions in thousands went surrounded by thousands of foot soldiers carrying javelins, spears, and nooses. Chiefs on horses, champions in thousands went surrounded by thousands of foot soldiers carrying javelins, spears, and nooses. Then all the consorts of Dasharatha, keeping Kausalya and Sumitra in front, seated in palanquin accompanied by Kaikeyi, started from Nandigram. Then the foremost of brahmins, leaders with garlands and Modaka sweets in hand, surrounded by ministers went with righteous Bharata, accompanied by bards praising, accompanied by sounds of blowing conches and drums and greeting. Bharata was emaciated due to fastings, was desperate, wearing bark fabric and skin of antelope. The great soul Bharata, knower of righteous responsibilities, greeting, experienced great joy, on hearing about the returning of the brother.

Bharata went to receive Sri Rama. The earth shook by the sounds of hooves of the horses, sounds of conches and drums, and the rattling of the chariot wheels. Reviewing the arrangements, Bharata spoke these words to wind god's son, Hanuman. \"O monkey! Indeed, you monkey being fickle minded, hope you have not resorted to your nature. I am not seeing noble Rama, the tormentor of enemies.\" And then Bharata having spoken that way, Hanuman understood the meaning of his words and spoke thus. \"By the grace of Bharadwaja, all the trees have fruits shedding sweet juice, and in bloom, the Vanaras are very delighted. The forest rangers are making terrific sounds. The tormentor of enemies, endowed with all virtues, by virtue of the boon given by Indra extended hospitality to the Vanara army. I think they are crossing the river Gomathi now.\" \"By the grace of Bharadwaja, all the trees have fruits shedding sweet juice, and in bloom, the Vanaras are very delighted.

I think they are crossing the river Gomathi now.\" \"See the rain of dust started at Sala Forest. Vanaras are shaking the beautiful Sala grove, I think.\" Pushpaka is seen at a distance, resembling the moon. This wonderful Pushpaka has been created through Brahma's mind. \"Rama's vehicle is amazing, and he got it by killing Ravana and his relatives. It shines brightly like the rising sun, and it speeds at the thought of mind. Kubera got this aerial car by Brahma's grace.\" \"Heroic Raghava brothers are there with Vaidehi, that highly energetic Sugriva and Rakshasa Vibheeshana also.\" Then when \"Sri Rama is here\" was uttered a fantastic expression of joy of the women, young, youth and aged was heard, which reached the heaven. Those people on the chariots, elephants and horses got down and saw them on the moon like Pushpaka. Highly rejoiced, Bharata offered salutations standing as he ought to within himself and worshiped Sri Rama from a distance. Sri Rama, elder brother of Bharata shone in the aerial car created by Brahma like another Indra. Then Bharata offered salutations with joined palms to Sri Rama seated in the peak of Pushpaka like saluting Sun from the mountain Meru. Then that excellent Pushpaka which had pictures of swans on it came down to the ground with Rama's permission. Bharata of unfailing valour duly permitted to ascend Pushpaka by Sri Rama, reached Rama and once again offered salutations to Rama. Kakuthsa Rama happily lifting up Bharata, who came into his sight after long, on to his thigh embraced him. Then the tormentor of enemies, Bharata approached Lakshmana and then greeted Vaidehi and announced his name. Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi thereafter embraced Sugriva, Jambavantha, Angada, Mainda, Dwivivida, Nila and Rshaba. He embraced Sushena, Nala, Gavaksha, Gandhamadana, Sarabha, Panasa who were around. Then he inquired about the welfare of those Vanaras who can take any form at will, who were in human form and was delighted. And thereafter highly brilliant, foremost among the righteous, prince Bharata embraced Sugriva, the bull among Vanaras and spoke. \"Sugriva, you are the fifth brother to four of us and should have been born like that\" said Bharata. One who helps becomes friend and maleficence is a sign of an enemy. And then Bharata spoke this good word. \"Luckily with your help, the very difficult task was done.\" Then hero Shatrughna and Lakshmana also greeted Rama and then worshipped Sita also. Rama reached his mother who was pale and emaciated in grief and offered salutations clasping her feet in obedience and was delighted in his mind. Then he greeted Sumitra, and illustrious Kaikeyi also and then all the mothers and the priests who had come. \"Welcome to you mighty armed Rama, enhancer of Kausalya's joy\" saying so citizens of the city spoke with folded hand s greeting Rama. The citizens in thousands greeting Rama, elder brother of Bharata lifting up their hand s with folded palms seemed like lotus buds. Taking the sandals given to Bharata, the knower of dharma put on the sandals on Rama's feet by himself. Bharata then greeted Rama with folded palms, spoke saying, \"this kingdom and everything held in trust by me is returned to you.\" Today my life is fulfilled, my wish is completed. I am seeing you returned to Ayodhya again as king of this kingdom. You may review your treasury, granary, palaces, army. Everything has increased tenfold by me by virtue of your brilliance. Seeing Bharata, the lover of his brother, who spoke like that, the Vanaras, Rakshasas, and Vibheeshana shed tears. Then rejoiced Raghava took Bharata on his lap and flew to Bharata's hermitage with the army. Raghava alighted from the top of the Pushpaka on reaching the hermitage of Bharata and stood on ground. Then Rama told Pushpaka that he was permitted to go to God Vysravana. That aerial car duly permitted by Rama rose up to go to Kubera and set out in the northern direction and flew. That wonderful Pushpaka received from Rakshasa impelled by Rama's order speedily went to Kubera.",
                "Bharata, the enhancer of Kaikeyi's joy, of unfailing valour, with folded palms on head submitted to his elder brother. \"This kingdom was bestowed on me and my mother. I return it back to you now again.\" \"I am not able to bear the heavy burden transferred to me any more like a young ox can't bear like a bull. \"If the kingdom containing vulnerable points is not protected on all sides, it can't stand, just as a strong rush of water can be prevented from breach only by constructing a dam. \"O Rama! Donkey can't run like horse crow can't run like swan. I am not able to bear the burden of kingdom like you, O tormentor of enemies.\" \"If for example you have planted a tree in your own house, it becomes huge and difficult to climb in spite of a large trunk, many branches and after flowering does not yield fruits and is withered, the person who planted will not enjoy the fruit. In that way O mighty armed Rama, you are the ruler of the people, if you would not take care of us, your dependants, I solicit you ought to understand what I mean. \"If for example you have planted a tree in your own house, it becomes huge and difficult to climb in spite of a large trunk, many branches and after flowering does not yield fruits and is withered, the person who planted will not enjoy the fruit.

As long as the stellar sphere goes round, and as long as the earth revolves around that long you enjoy the rulership of the world.\" Hearing Bharata's words, the conqueror of enemies, Rama said 'Be it so'. Then Bharata took the auspicious seat. Then at the command of Shatrughna's words, experts with hand work (barbers) who had soft skills quickly surrounded Raghava. Bharata had his bath first, and mighty Lakshmana, Sugriva the monkey king, and Vibheeshana the Rakshasa king followed him. Sri Rama removed the matted hair, had bath, adorned with colourful garlands, and daubed with sandal paste and clothed in exquisite robes stood glowing and shining.

Sri Rama removed the matted hair, had bath, adorned with colourful garlands, and daubed with sandal paste and clothed in exquisite robes stood glowing and shining. Then valiant and prosperous, Shatrughna, who is an enhancer of the glory of Ikshvaku race decorated Sri Rama and Lakshmana (duly with ornaments). Then all the nobleminded Dasharatha's wives themselves decorated Sita beautifully. The very delighted Kausalya, lover of her sons started making effort to decorate the wives of all Vanaras in a splendid manner. Then Sumantra the charioteer, commanded by Shatrughna came there with all parts of the chariot decorated and yoked. Seeing the wonderful chariot like the radiance of the planet sun, mighty armed Rama the conqueror of hostile enemies ascended. Sugriva and Hanuman having bathed wore sparkling earrings, clothed in heavenly robes vied with Mahendra in splendour, started. Sugriva's wife and Sita decked with all kinds of ornaments and earrings, enthused to see the city, started. At Ayodhya also, king Dasharatha's ministers, priests started to Vasishta and thought of the required arrangements. Ashoka, Vijaya, Siddhartha, collected together and started consulting with each other for the growth of Rama and the City. For the success of the great soul Rama's consecration, whatever was auspicious, all that ought to be done as he deserves. All those ministers, priests thus communicating with each other, speedily set forth to have a glance at Sri Rama. Like the thousand eyed Indra seated in the excellent chariot yoked to green horses, the sinless Rama departed to the city. Bharata held the reins, Shatrughna took hold of the parasol, Lakshmana standing in front held the fan, and the Rakshasa king Vibheeshana held a white whisk which was like a moon for driving the air. Bharata held the reins, Shatrughna took hold of the parasol, Lakshmana standing in front held the fan, and the Rakshasa king Vibheeshana held a white whisk which was like a moon for driving the air. Then the host of sages, Rudras and gods from the heaven started praising Rama with sweet sounding chanting. Then resplendent Sugriva, the bull among Vanaras, ascended the mountain like elephant by the name Satrumjaya. Assuming human semblance, the Vanaras adorned with ornaments ascended nine thousand elephants and departed. Sri Rama the tiger among men went accompanied by sounds of blasts of conches and shouts and roll of drums along the rows of mansions in the city.

All were endowed with signs of good culture, given to righteous behaviour. Rama ruled the kingdom for ten thousand years with brothers.
