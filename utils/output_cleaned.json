                "Ascetic Valmiki enquired of Narada, preeminent among the sages ever engaged in the practice of religious austerities or study of the Vedas and best among the eloquent. Who in this world lives today endowed with excellent qualities, prowess, righteousness, gratitude, truthfulness and firmness in Rama's vows? Who is that one gifted with good conduct, given to the wellbeing of all living creatures, learned in the lore (knowledge of all things that is known), capable of doing things which others can not do and singularly handsome? Who (among men) is selfrestrained? Who has conquered anger? Who is endowed with brilliance and free from envy? Who is that when excited to wrath even the devatas, are afraid of (let alone foes)? O Maharshi, I intend to hear about such a man whom you are able to place? Indeed great is my curiosity\". Invited by Valmiki to take his seat Narada, knower of the three worlds heard him and said with delight, \"Listen to me!\". And thus spoke. \"O sage rare indeed are men endowed with the many qualities you have described. I  ascertained one. Listen carefully.

Thereafter, having seen the preparations for installation of Rama, queen Kaikeyi who had been promised earlier with boons by Dasaratha demanded of king Dasaratha the exile of Rama and enthronement of Bharata. Dasaratha, true to king Dasaratha's word and restrained by the bond of duty, sent his beloved  son Rama to the forest. Mighty Sri Rama inorder to please Kaikeyi and obey the word of command of his father, king Dasaratha went to the forest and help king Dasaratha to keep his promise to Kaikeyi. Lakshmana  beloved brother to Rama is drawn towards Rama. Endowed with modesty Lakshmana is an enhancer of the joy of his mother Sumitra.

The citizens and king Dasaratha followed Rama for a long distance. Rama of righteous nature having approached Guha, king of nishadas, at Shrungiberapura sent back charioteer Sumantra and Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana crossed river Ganga. Moving from one forest to another and crossing deep and wide rivers with plenty of waters, reached the Chitrakuta mountain by the command of sage Bharadwaja.

They raised a hut made of leaves in the forest located in Chitrakuta mountain. and dwelt  there happily resembling devas and gandharvas. When Rama had set out to Chitrakuta, king Dasaratha, stricken by the grief over the separation from his son and mourning over Rama departed to heavens. After king Dasaratha had passed away, mighty Bharata did not desire to rule the kingdom  against the orders by Vasishta and other brahmins. The brave Bharata, who had conquered envy and hatred went to the forest in order to worship Rama's feet. Bharata reached Rama, so pleasing venerable, truthful and chivalrous, worshipped Rama with reverence and implored. Bharata addressing Rama said, 'Rama is knower of righteousness. Rama alone should  be the king (meaning that when the elder brother is alive, the younger brother is prohibited from ruling the kingdom)'. Although a source of universal delight, although exceedingly generous and of cheerful countenance, highly renowned and capable Rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father, king Dasaratha. Having handed over his sandals to Bharata as symbol of authority for ruling the kingdom, Rama persuaded Bharata again and again to return to the capital. Disaaponted in his mission to take Rama back, Bharata worshipped the sandals of Rama and ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, awaiting Rama's return. When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows  one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination (so that there would not be breach of Rama's promise). When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows  one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination (so that there would not be breach of Rama's promise). Having entered the dense forest Dandaka, Rama slew the demon Viradha and saw the sages Sarabhanga, Sutikshna and Agastya with Lakshmana. As directed by sage Agastya, Rama received with extreme delight a bow, a sword and quivers with inexhaustible arrows, given by Indra to Agastya (to be passed on to Rama). While Rama was dwelling in the forest (in the hermitage of sage Sarabhanga), all the ascetics along with others (sages) inhabiting the forest approached Rama requesting for the destruction of the asuras and rakshasas seizing upon their lives. Rama promised those ascetics, who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them. Rama promised those ascetics, who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them. During Rama's stay there a demon called Surpanakha living in Janasthana (resting place for the army of Ravana in Dandakaranya) and capable of assuming any form at will was rendered deformed by Lakshmana. Thereafter Rama killed in the fight all the rakshasas, Khara, Trisira, and Dushana with their followers in a battle who were instigated by  Surpanakha's words. During Rama's stay in that forest Rama killed fourteen thousand rakshasas who were inhabitants of Janasthana. Having heard the slaughter of fellow rakshasa, Ravana became violent with anger and sought the help of a rakshasa named Maricha. Maricha repeatedly dissuaded Ravana saying, 'O Ravana It  is not proper for Ravana to enter into hostility with the  mighty and powerful Rama'. Disregarding Maricha's words Ravana incited by fate left for the hermitage of Rama along with Maricha. Ravana with the help of deceitful Maricha drew the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) far away from their hermitage abducted Sita the wife of Rama and  slaughtered vulture Jatayu, Having seen and heard from the eagle Jatayu struck down by Ravana that Sita had been abducted Rama bewailed, choked with tears Rama's senses dulled by distress. Then Rama performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture Jatayu. Wandering in search of Sita, Rama beheld a rakshasa named Kabandha who was dreadful, in deformed in appearance. Then Rama performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture Jatayu. Wandering in search of Sita, Rama beheld a rakshasa named Kabandha who was dreadful, in deformed in appearance. Mightyarmed Rama, having killed Kabandha, consigned Kabandha's body to flames. While leaving for heavens Kabandha informed Rama saying, 'O Raghava, there is a female ascetic in Sabara community, performing religious duties and proficient in practising austerities. Rama son of Dasaratha, destroyer of enemies and possessing great splendour approached Sabari who duly worshipped Rama. On the bank of Pampa Rama met a monkey named Hanuman on whose advice Rama made friendship with Sugriva. Mighty  Rama related to Sugriva all that had happened right from the beginning, more importantly Sita's abduction and also to Hanuman. Hearing everything that story from Rama, Sugriva was very pleased and made a pact with Rama in the presence of Agni as witness. Thereafter Sugriva, king of monkeys filled with sorrow narrated to Rama out of friendship the entire account of Sugriva's hostilities (with Vali). Then Rama vowed to slay Vali. The monkey (Sugriva) described about Vali's prowess to Rama. Doubtful of the prowess of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed Rama the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain. Doubtful of the prowess of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed Rama the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain. The strongarmed Rama, who was endowed with great strength looked at the skeleton and smiled within himself for a while. Rama kicked off the skeleton with the great toe of his foot completely to a full distance of ten yojanas (eighty miles). Again inorder to create confidence (in Sugriva), Rama released a single mighty shaft which penetrated seven palmyra trees, a mountain and the Rasatala. Pleased with Rama's action and convinced of Rama's prowess Sugriva left thereafter with Rama he left for Kishkindha which was like a cave. On entering the city of Kishkindha, Sugriva the best of monkeys of reddish yellow hue roared with a great voice. There upon Vali, the lord of monkeys came out (of the cave). After convincing his wife Tara, who was dissuading Vali from this, Vali entered into a combat with Sugriva. There, Rama killed Vali with a single shaft. After Rama killed Vali in the combat in compliance with the words of Sugriva, Rama installed Sugriva as  king. The best of monkeys (Sugriva) gathered his monkey forces and despatched them in various directions in search of Janaka's daughter (Sita). At the suggestion of the vulture, Sampathi mighty Hanuman leapt over the saltocean extending over a hundred yojanas. Hanuman arrived at the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and found Sita in the Ashoka garden meditating on Rama. Hanuman delivered Rama's ring to Sita as a token of recognition, related the whole story and consoled Sita. Hanuman then crushed the arch (of the outer gate of the garden) before leaving. After killing five commanders, seven sons of the counsellors, stamping out valiant Akshayakumara, the son of Ravana, Hanuman got himself captured (to be taken as captive). The heroic Hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to Hanuman through a boon by Brahma. Hanuman allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas with the ropes for the sake of achieving Hanuman's other objective of seeing Ravana. Thereafter, Hanuman burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama.

Thereafter, Hanuman burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama. Reaching Rama the great Hanuman gifted with boundless intellect circumambulated Rama and infact informed Rama that he had seen Sita. Thereafter, Rama reached the shore of the ocean together with Sugriva and saw the ocean agitated with shafts burning like the Sun. Samudra, lord of rivers, (afraid of Rama's anger) and having appeared in his own form, and on Rama's advice got a bridge built with the help of Nala. Rama entered the city of Lanka by means of that bridge, killed Ravana in the battle and recovered Sita. Thereafter Rama felt greatly embarassed (for accepting his wife who had stayed in an others. Rama spoke harsh words about Sita in the assembly. Sita, incapable of enduring such words, entered fire. With the of testimony of the firegod, Rama was exceedingly pleased to know that Sita was sinless. All the gods adored Rama. All the animate and inanimate beings, gods and sages in the three worlds were very pleased at this noble deed of the great Rama. After coronating the rakshasa chief Vibhishana in the city of Lanka, Rama free from distress, exceedingly rejoiced after having accomplished Rama's objective. Having obtained a boon from the devatas (who had come to see Rama) Rama, revived all monkeys (fallen in the battle) and set out for Ayodhya accompanied by friends in the  pushpaka (aerial car). Rama who was a delight of all whose strength lies in truth went to the hermitage of Bharadwaja (as promised) and  despatched Hanuman to Bharata as Rama's messenger. Again accompanied by Sugriva and recalling earlier incidents and after both of them discussed with each other, Rama departed to Nandigrama riding that pushpaka chariot. At Nandigrama sinless Rama arrived, met his brothers. They shed their  matted locks. With  Sita  restored  Rama regained his kingdom. The entire world rejoiced with happiness with their desire fulfilled they were content.  All people were following the path of righteousness. There was no fear of sufferings or agonies, diseases or famine. During the period of Rama's rule, no where would men witness the death of their sons or women widowed. They would ever remain chaste and devoted to their husbands. There (in the kingdom of Rama) was no fear of fire, water, wind, disease, hunger and also theft. All the cities and villages were affluent with wealth and food grains. People lived happily as though they lived in Kritayuga. Highly renowned Rama, having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas  bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins, will return to Brahmaloka. Highly renowned Rama, having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas  bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins, will return to Brahmaloka. Rama will establish hundredfold royal dynasties and employ the four castes to do their respective duties, in this world. Rama, reigning the kingdom for eleven thousand years, will attain Brahmaloka. This story of Rama is sacred and holy. It destroys sins and is equal to the Vedas. Whosoever reads this story of Rama will be freed from all sins. This story of Ramayana enhances longevity of those who read it and recite it. They will be worshipped in heavens after their death along with their sons and grandsons, servants and relations. A brahmin becomes proficient in the eighteen branches of learning a kshatriya gets lordship over landed possessions a vaisya gets the fruits of his business and sudra also attains greatness  by reading Ramayana\".

                "On hearing the words of Narada the distinguished and righteous sage Valmiki, proficient in composing slokas worshipped Narada along with his disciples. The divine sage Narada after having been worshipped by Valmiki in a befitting manner sought Valmiki's leave and went to heaven. After Narada had gone to devaloka, sage Valmiki reached the bank of river Tamasa which is not very far from the Ganges for morning ablutions. The eminent sage Valmiki reached the bank of Tamasa and seen a descent into the river with pellucid waters, spoke to the disciple standing by the side. \"O Bharadwaja, behold the beautiful and pleasant waters of this river. This holy spot is as clear and pure as the mind of a virtuous man. O dear one Put down the pitcher on the ground. Give me Valmiki's garment. Valmiki shall take a dip in Tamasa, the holiest of places\". Asked thus by the nobleminded master Valmiki, Bharadwaja, ever obedient to his spiritual master, gave the sage the bark garment. Valmiki who had Valmiki's senses under Valmiki's command received the barkgarment from the hands of his disciple and wandered about in that extensive forest, looking all around. Sage Valmiki espied a pair of melodious kraunchas. Flying about in each other's in separable company there in its vicinity. A sinful and cruelhearted hunter struck down the male bird of the pair in its very presence. The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail. The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail. Then, having seen the bird struck down by the fowler, the pious sage Valmiki was filled with compassion. Having heard the wailing of the female bird, the sage Valmiki moved to pity at this irreligious act uttered the following words. \"O fowler, since you have killed one of the pair of infatuated kraunchas you will be permanently deprived of your position\". Brooding over his utterances, Valmiki reflected, 'What is this that Valmiki uttered in reaction to the grief of this bird?' Very wise and learned, Valmiki, preeminent among sages, pondered over it (for a while) and spoke these words to his disciple. \"Occasioned by the griefstricken (state of the bird) and composed in rhymed lines each of equal number of syllables tuned to the accompaniment of stringed instruments, let it be known as a sloka and not by any other name\". His disciple, delighted by the excellent verse composed by the sage, committed it to memory which left his spiritual preceptor pleased. After having performed his ablution at that holy spot according to the prescribed ritual, the sage Valmiki returned (to his hermitage), pondering over the matter. Then saint Bharadwaja, his disciple humble and learned in scriptures, followed Valmiki with a pitcher full (of water). Valmiki who knows dharma entered the hermitage along with his disciple and sat in meditation and composed other stories. At that moment, the effulgent, fourfaced Brahma, creator and lord of the world, himself, desirous of seeing Valmiki, the best among sages, arrived. Greatly surprised to see Brahma, Valmiki, purified by austerities and disciplined in speech, immediately got up and with folded palms stood before Brahma. Bowing with reverence as enjoined by tradition and having enquired of his well being, Valmiki worshipped the immutable Brahma by falling at Brahma's feet and welcoming Brahma with a seat and water to wash Brahma's feet with. Lord Brahma sat down on a highly worshipful seat and showed a seat for the ascetic Valmiki to be seated. Having been ordered by Brahma, Valmiki also sat down on a seat. Although seated in the presence of the lord of the worlds, Valmiki was absorbed in the thought of events (leading to the death of the krauncha ). The hunter killed the sweetvoiced krauncha without any cause. That sinfulminded one with hostile feeling of capturing it, had perpetrated this cruel act, Valmiki thought. Griefstricken, Valmiki having become introspective and lamenting the plight of the female krauncha again and again, recited this sloka. Thereafter lord Brahma smilingly addressed Valmiki, the preeminent among sages, saying, \"You have indeed composed a sloka.There is no doubt about it\". \"OBrahmarshi, at Valmiki's will, this speech had originated from you. Most excellent ascetic, compose the history of Rama in its entirety (in this metre). Narrate the history of Rama who is renowned for righteousness, virtues, wisdom and steadfastness in the manner Valmiki has heard it from sage Narada. The incidents pertaining to sagacious Rama together with Lakshmana, Sita, Bharata, etc. and the rakshasas their deeds, thoughts, unknown or known to everybody and even not known to Valmiki, will be revealed to Valmiki by Brahma's grace. The incidents pertaining to sagacious Rama together with Lakshmana, Sita, Bharata, etc. and the rakshasas their deeds, thoughts, unknown or known to everybody and even not known to Valmiki, will be revealed to Valmiki by Brahma's grace. Not even a single word of yours in this epic will ever prove untruthful. Compose this sacred, delightful story of Rama, set in the form of slokas. As long as the mountains and rivers exist on this earth, the story of Ramayana will prevail among the people. So long as the story of the Ramayana composed by Valmiki is remembered in this world, Valmiki will live in the upper world, the nether world and Brahmaloka\". Having spoken these words, lord Brahma vanished. At this Valmiki and his disciples were astonished. Thereafter, the disciples of Valmiki chanted this sloka again and again in delight. They were greatly astonished and spoke about it often. This sloka of four lines, each consisting of equal number of syllables, was recited by the maharshi. Constant recitation (by others) elicited admiration (from the listeners). A thought occurred to Valmiki, who is capable of putting thoughts into action \"Valmiki shall compose the epic named Ramayana entirely in this metre\". The renowned and sagacious sage composed a kavya with hundreds of charming verses, each containing equal number of syllables and excellent meaningful words set in metre, conferring glory on celebrated Rama. This story of Rama and the killing of Ravana composed by the sage consists of compound words, melodious sandhis and lines composed in lucid, melodious and meaningful phrases. Listen to it. : Thus ends the second sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the entire story of Rama from the intellecual Narada, the righteous Valmiki sought to know clearly more about the history of Rama endowed  with wisdom.

These two princes blameless, disciplined and wellversed, committed to memory the whole epic and chanted as instructed in the assembly of rishis, brahmins and saints. On a particular occasion both the great princes who were dignified and endowed with good features, chanted this great epic in the presence of honoured ascetics who assembled at one place.  All the sages having heard the chanting (of that glorious kavya), experienced great astonishment. Overcome with tears of joy in their eyes, they praised Kusa and Lava, exclaiming \"Excellent, Excellent\". All the sages steeped in dharma, pleased with Kusa and Lava, praised the admirable Kusa and Lava as they sang. How melodious is this chanting, especially the verses Though it (the events) had happened long ago, it is described as if it is happening at the present moment, exclaimed the audience.  They both chanted in perfect unison in theme and passion, with their charming melodious voice endowed with the rich notes of music (sadja and other). Praised in this manner by the great sages commendable for their austerities, Kusa and Lava chanted even with greater charm and sweetness. Pleased with the singing, one of the sages seated in the assembly presented Kusa and Lava a pitcher. Another sage of renown got so delighted that he gave Kusa and Lava garments. This wonderful epic chronologically composed and completed by the sage (Valmiki),  is the supreme source for poetry. The two singers, proficient in all kinds of notes recited the epic in the streets and on the principal roads. It was pleasing to hear for all. It gave long life and prosperity to the listeners. People admired Kusa and Lava. Once Rama happened to see Kusa and Lava. The two singers, proficient in all kinds of notes recited the epic in the streets and on the principal roads. It was pleasing to hear for all. It gave long life and prosperity to the listeners. People admired Kusa and Lava. Once Rama happened to see Kusa and Lava. Thereafter, Rama, the destroyer of enemies, having invited the two brothers Kusa and Lava who deserved honour. Rama brought Kusa and Lava to Rama's royal palace and extended respectful hospitality. Rama, the tormentor of enemies, surrounded by Rama's ministers and brothers occupied the splendid golden throne. Then selfpossessed Rama, having seen those very handsome brothers (Kusa and Lava), addressed Lakshmana, Satrughna and Bharata, saying: \"Listen to this story sung by both of them, portraying excellent sense and words\". Having said this, Rama urged the singers with the lustre of devatas to commence. Both of them, with good and ample voice, chanted the kavya in a distinctly meaningful way. Tuning their stringed instruments, Kusa and Lava sang melodiously and engagingly. The chanting of the kavya in the assembly of men comforted the sense of hearing. The listeners rejoiced in their mind, heart and the whole being. Addressing the assembly of men Rama said \"Both Kusa and Lava, even though ascetics, are endowed with the attributes of royalty. Eventhough Kusa and Lava are singers, Kusa and Lava are ascetics. This is even conducive to Rama's wellbeing. Listen to the meaningful story with concentration\". Encouraged by the words of Rama, the two brothers chanted according to marga mode of singing (classical style). Even Rama who was in the assembly desirous of peace, concentrated Rama's mind on that chanting.      : Thus ends the fourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Formerly, this entire earth belonged to those victorious kings starting from Prajapati (Manu). Among them a king named Sagara got the ocean dug and Sagar's sixty thousand sons surrounded Sagar whenever Sagar went (to battle). It was from the family of mighty monarchs with Ikshvaku as its founder and the kings born in that race, the celebrated epic known as the 'Ramayanam' arose. I shall propagate this Ramayanam, incorporating the merits of dharma, artha and kama, and complete in all respects. It deserves to be heard right from the start without prejudice. On the banks of river Sarayu, a great and prosperous country named Kosala, abundant in foodgrains and wealth and inhabited by contended people, was situated. In the country called Kosala was the famous capital city of Ayodhya built by the lord of men, Manu . With welllaid out thoroughfares, the beautiful and prosperous city of Ayodhya extended for twelve yojanas in length and three yojanas in breadth. It looked splendid with its welllaid out and broad highway strewn with flowers and regularly sprinkled with water. King Dasartha, augmenting the prosperity of the great kingdom, lived in the city of Ayodhya like Indra in heaven. The city where all kinds of artificers lived had arched outer gateways, wellarranged local markets and all kinds of instruments and weapons. With matchless splendour, it abounded in eulogists and genealogists. It contained stately edifices decorated with flags and hundreds of sataghnis (missiles). The city with suburban towns on all sides had several female dancers and actors.It was filled with gardens and mangogroves. And girdled by sal trees. It was enclosed by strong fortifications and a deep moat. No enemy can ever enter and occupy that city. It abounded with several elephants and horses, cattle, camels and mules. It was embellished with a host of tributary kings who used to pay tributes and with merchants from different countries. Like Indra's Amaravati, it was adorned by mountains and mansions with precious stones. With groups of men and women and adorned with sevenstoried palaces, it looked wonderful like a board where the game of ashtapada, is played. It was rich in all kinds of gems. Its dwellings were constructed on levelled ground with no space left unutilised. It was abundantly stocked with fine-grained rice and water which tasted sweet like sugarcane juice. The city echoed with the sounds of trumpets, mrudangas, vinas and panavas. There was no city on earth superior to Ayodhya. Like an aerial car acquired by the siddhas in heaven through their austerities, the palaces were perfectly constructed in rows and inhabited by the noblest of men. The city was inhabited by thousands of warriors known as maharathas. They were skilled archers and sharphanded. They would not pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound. With sharp arrows or with the strength of their arms, they would kill roaring and inebriated lions, tigers, boars etc. in the forest. It was in that city (of Ayodhya) that king Dasaratha lived.

The people living in that excellent city were happy, virtuous, wellread (in the Vedas and the sastras) and content with the possessions of their own. They were free from avarice. And always spoke the truth. In that best of cities, there was not even a single householder who had not adequate wealth or who had not achieved dharma, artha and kama or who did not possess the wealth of foodgrains, cattle and horses. The lustful, the miserly, the unscholarly and atheists were not to be seen anywhere in the city of Ayodhya. All men and women (in the city) were of righteous conduct, fully selfcontrolled and prosperous with good conduct and behaviour. They were pure like maharshis. In the city, there was none without earornaments, without coronet, without wearing garlands and none unclean. And none without the anointment of fragrants on the body.

There were no thieves or meanminded persons or persons of improper descent of mixed castes. The brahmins were always interested in the performance of their duties. They had control over their senses.

There was not even one who would not donate in thousands. There was no one distracted or depressed. In Ayodhya, there was no man or woman who was not endowed with wealth or beauty.

That city was ably governed by Dasaratha, scion of the Ikshvakus, in the same way as it was previously administered by (Manu), the foremost among men and and the most intelligent. It abounded with warriors, like a cave with lions. They were almost like flaming fire, the most determined among experts and accomplished in learning (the science of arms). The city was full of excellent horses born in the regions of Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu and Sindhu, similar to that of Indra's horse (called Ucchaisrava). It was full of intoxicated elephants born in Vindhya mountains, elephants of enormous strength looking like mountains and born in the Himalayas.

The eight ministers were Dhrishti, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala and Sumantra.

They never inflicted any punishment even on those who were not their wellwishers, if they did not commit any offence. They were heroic. They possessed steady perseverance. They followed the state policy and always protected the virtuous people living in the state. While ensuring that they did not cause pain to brahmanas and kshatriyas (in thought, word and deed), they filled the treasury. They inflicted stringent punishments on a man after examining a man's strength and weakness. While the ministers of chaste conduct administered the kingdom with unanimous decisions, there was no one who was a liar, either in the city or in the kingdom. In that kingdom no one was wicked or enamoured of others' wives. Serenity prevailed over the entire kingdom including the city of excellence. They all were welldressed in fine clothes. They possessed good character with an eye on justice and vigilant about king Dasaratha's welfare. They imbibed virtues from the elderlies. They were renowned in prowess. They were guided by their intellect in all affairs. They were wellknown everywhere. The ministers were inherently well aware of the real nature of peace or war.

                "Such a majestic, righteous, and magnaninous king had no son to perpetuate the race even though Dasaratha performed austerities for one. While reflecting over the matter, a thought struck the magnanimous king: 'Why not invoke gods by performing a horsesacrifice for a son'. Having made up his mind to perform the sacrifice, that sagacious and pious king, in consultation with his wise ministers, issued the following command to Sumantra, the best of ministers \"Bring all my spritual preceptors along with family priests.\" Having made up his mind to perform the sacrifice, that sagacious and pious king, in consultation with his wise ministers, issued the following command to Sumantra, the best of ministers \"Bring all my spritual preceptors along with family priests.\" Thereupon Sumantra of swift movement immediateiy brought together Suyajna, Vamadeva,Jabali, Kasyapa and priest Vasistha along with other brahmins who had mastery over the Vedas. Thereupon Sumantra of swift movement immediateiy brought together Suyajna, Vamadeva,Jabali, Kasyapa and priest Vasistha along with other brahmins who had mastery over the Vedas. Virtuous king Dasaratha paid homage to them (the ministers) and uttered these gracious, righteous and meaningful words. There is no happiness for one who has no son. This is the cause of my intense suffering. Therefore, I have made up my mind to perform a horsesacrifice. Therefore, I intend to perform a horsesacrifice in accordance with the scriptures. How can king Dasaratha fulfil king Dasaratha's desire in this regard? You may deliberate and find a solution\". The brahmins along with Vasishta in the forefront extolled the king's decision, exclaiming, 'Well, Well'. Highly pleased, they all said to king Dasaratha, \"Requisite articles be collected for the sacrifice and the horse be released.\" 'O king, the wish that arose in king Dasaratha's mind is just and right. You will definitely obtain sons as desired by you.' On hearing the words of the brahmins, the king was pleased and said to his ministers with eyes excited with delight. \"Let the articles required (for performing the sacrifice) be procured in accordance with the words of my spiritual preceptors and the horse be released under the protection of able men. On the northern bank of Sarayu, a sacrificial pavillion be prepared according to the methods ordained in the 'Kalpa'. Auspicious rites be performed in accordance with the ordinance for its uninterrupted completion. If obstructions and omissions do not occur in the conduct of this best of sacrifices, it will be possible for every king to get the results. The learned brahmarakshasas always look out for flaws in the sacrifice so that they can spoil it. If a flaw finds place, the doer of the sacrifice is immediately destroyed. Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner this sacifice is completed in accordance with the scriptures. And in this, you are experts\". Having heard these words of this Indra on earth (king Dasaratha) all the ministers with due respect replied: \"May it be as ordered\". Bowing to this best of kings (Dasaratha), all the brahmins who were experts in austerities left all the knowledgeable brahmins as they camewith king Dasaratha's permission. After sending away the brahmins, the king said to his ministers: \"Let this sacrifice be performed as enjoined by scriptures and as directed by the officiating priests\". Having thus ordered his ministers sitting nearby, sent them away and entered the inner apartment. Thereafter the king said to his dearest wives: \"I intend to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain sons. Therefore, you, too, commence religious discipline.\" On listening to these exceedingly charming words, their bright countenances shone resplendent like lotuses after the departure of winter. : Thus ends the eighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The charioteer tells the king in privacy that the charioteer has heard the advice given by the officiating priests. \"O king, the divine Sanatkumara had narrated a story about your posterity in the presence of sages. Kasyapa has a famous son named Vibhandaka. It was prophesied that Vibhandaka's son would have a son named Rsyasringa. Grown up in the forest and always moving with Vibhandaka, Rsyasringa knows none other than Vibhandaka. O eminent king, sage Rsyasringa celebrated in the three worlds who practises a twofold brahmacharya life (life of celebacy) described by brahmins (as vratitva and prajapatya). Worshipping the firegod and attending on Vibhandaka, Rsyasringa will spend a long time living in this manner (practising vratitva mode of brahmacharya). At this time a powerful king Romapada, mighty and celebrated would be living in the country of Anga. Because of violation of code of conduct by king Romapada, a terrible, dreadful drought frightening all living beings will set in the kingdom. With drought prevailing, the griefstricken king Romapada, would summon all those grown old with learning and tell them. Those brahmins versed in the Vedas, said, to 'O king Romapada bring here Rsyasringa, son of the sage Vibhandaka by all means'. \"O monarch, on having brought Rsyasringa here, honour Rsyasringa, and offer king Romapada's daughter Santa with due reverence. On hearing their words, king Romapada in a thoughtful mood said, 'How can the mighty sage be brought here'? Thereafter the confident king Romapada, having decided, in consultation with king Romapada's ministers to bring Rsyasringa, sent the priest with the counsellors on this mission. On hearing king Romapada's words, distressed and frightened by rishi's power, they appealed to king Romapada, faces bent down, 'We will not go'. After thinking about the means to be employed to bring the rishi to the court, they told king Romapada they would bring the sage if they are not to blame (in case anything untoward happens). Thus with the help of courtesans of the king of Anga, when the son of the sage Rsyasringa was brought rains followed. The king Romapada offered his daughter Santa (in marriage to the sage Rsyasringa). 'Risyasringa, king Romapada's soninlaw, would help king Romapada to obtain sons'. Thus said Sanathkumara which I have related to you. Thereupon Dasaratha, pleased, (with him), said to Sumantra, \"Describe in detail the means by which Rsyasringa was brought (to the court of Romapada)\". : Thus ends the ninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus prompted by king Dasaratha, Sumantra said, \"I shall relate to you the manner in which Rsyasringa was brought to the court. Listen to me along with your ministers\". The priest accompanied by ministers said to Romapada, \"We have thought over a plan which will never fail.\" \"Rsyasringa, residing in the forest, is engrossed in the study of the Vedas. Rsyasringa is not acquainted with women and sensual pleasures. By means of such things that can cause sensual pleasures and overpower the minds of men, we shall be able to bring Rsyasringa to the town. Let it be decided quickly (said the ministers) Beautiful and welladorned courtesans, may be sent there. They will allure Rsyasringa by various means and honourably bring Rsyasringa here. The king, having listened to these words, conveyed his approval saying, 'Let it be done that way'. The priests and ministers acted accordingly. Having heard this, beautiful courtesans entered the great forest and remaining at a place not far from the hermitage made efforts to steal a sight of this son of a sage (Rsyasringa), this forest dweller, this controller of the senses. Rsyasringa was always content and never stirred out of his father's hermitage. Absorbed in penance he had never seen a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth. Rsyasringa was always content and never stirred out of his father's hermitage. Absorbed in penance he had never seen a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth. One day this son of Vibhandaka (Rsyasringa) accidentally came to the place where he saw the beautiful women. Those wonderfully attired women singing with sweet voices approached the son of the sage (Rsyasringa) and said: 'O brahman Who are you? How are you subsisting? We wish to know why you are roaming alone in this dreadful forest? Could you tell us.' Rsyasringa had never seen such charming women in the forest. Rsyasringa developed affection towards them and a desire arose in Rsyasringa to speak about his father. 'My father is Vibhandaka. I am Vibhandaka's own son. My name is Rsyasringa. I am known the world over by this name associated with my karma'. 'O auspiciouslooking women, our hermitage is nearby. I will extend to you due hospitality'. After listening to the words of the sage's son (Rsyasringa), all the beautiful women with a desire to see the hermitage accompanied Rsyasringa. Thereafter the son of ascetic respectfully received the the strangers saying, \"(Accept) our offerings, here is water for washing feet and here are roots and fruits\". The anxious courtesans received the offerings and afraid of the ascetic's return, made up their minds to withdraw immediately. 'O brahmin, these are excellent fruits. May prosperity be to you. Accept them and eat them without delay.' Then, all the courtesans embracing Rsyasringa with joy, offered plentiful sweetmeats and various items of food. The lustrous (Rsyasringa) who had never tasted any food other than what was offered by the permanent forestdwellers mistook them for fruits. The ladies apprehensive of (the arrival of) his father took leave of Rsyasringa on the pretext of observance of (evening) rites. When they all departed, Kasyapa's son, the brahmin roamed (Rsyasringa) with a restless mind charged with sorrow. On the following day, the sage armed with the power of penance, came to the place where he had seen those enticing, welladorned courtesans. All of them were rejoiced on seeing the brahmin approaching them, came nearer to Rsyasringa and said: 'O handsome one, come to our hermitage. A special, sumptuous hospitality will be extended to you', they said. Having heard their words pleasing to the mind, Rsyasringa agreed to go with them. And the women took Rsyasringa away. As the illustrious sage was being brought (to Anga) the god of rain (Parjanya) suddenly inundated the earth which looked cherful (with rain). The king (Romapada) went out to welcome the ascetic, the brahmin who brought along with him rains to his country. Romapada humbly bowed down his head and prostrated before Rsyasringa. Romapada gave that Indra among the brahmins offerings righteously with unstinted devotion and asked for Rsyasringa's favour that Romapada should not incur the wrath of the sage (his father Vibhandaka for having brought him to Anga). The king entered the inner apartment, duly offered Rsyasringa his daughter Shanta in marriage and experienced peace and satisfaction. Thus he (Rsyasringa) lived there, with all his desires fulfilled\" (said Sumantra).      : Thus ends the tenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"Great king, I shall tell you the way Sanatkumara, great among the celestials further narrated the story. Listen to my words which may prove useful to you (said Sumantra)\". That king Dasaratha will develop friendship with the king of Anga. A highly virtuous daughter named Santa will be born to king of Anga. The famous king Dasaratha will approach the son of the king of Anga known as Romapada. O righteous king I am issueless. Let Rsyasringa, husband of Santa be ordered to perform the a sacrificial ceremony so that I shall be blessed with I son for the perpetuaion of my race. On hearing Romapada's words and deeply thinking over the matter, the prudent Romapada agreed to send, Santa's husband Rsyasringa, capable of blessing him with a son. The king relieved of his suffering, was highly delighted. He would take the brahmin Rsyasringa with him and perform the sacrificial ritual. King Dasaratha, lord of the people, and knower of dharma and truth, desirous of performing the sacrifice would ask Rsyasringa, with folded palms for granting a boon to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain children and to attain heaven.

Crossing forests and rivers slowly, the king reached the place where that foremost of ascetics lived. He reached the spot and saw the son of the ascetic, the best of brahmins glowing like fire seated next to Romapada. Then the king Romapada, delighted at heart out of friendship with the king Dasaratha, offered special hospitality with respectful salutations in accordance with propriety. Romapada explained Romapada's friendship and relationship with him Dasaratha. Rsyasringa of great intellect in return felicitated Dasaratha. In this manner, the great among men, the king wellhonoured by Romapada, spent seven or eight days there.And then spoke this to Romapada: O lord of people, O king, It has been decided to commence an important sacrificial rite. You may send your daughter Santa along with her husband Rsyasringa to my city. Having agreed to the departure of the sage Romapada said, 'Be pleased to go (to Ayodhya) together with your wife Santa'. The son of the sage Rsyasringa assented to the king's command saying 'So be it'. And permitted by him Romapada, departed along with wife Santa (for Ayodhya). Dasaratha and Romapada, pleased with this, wished each other with folded palms and hugged each other with love. Then king Dasaratha, took leave of his friend Romapada and set out. He despatched swiftfooted messengers to the citizens with the command. \"Let the entire city be welldecorated, perfumed, sprinkled with water and cleaned with flags hoisted.\" The people of the city having heard the king's arrival were overjoyed. They did everything as by the king. Then the king entered that welldecorated city amidst blares of conches and the beating of drums, with the best of the brahmins Rsyasringa in the forefront. The citizens were delighted to behold that brahmin Rsyasringa entering the city duly honoured by the king Dasaratha who was equivalent to Indra in valiance He king Dasaratha took him in to the inner apartment and extended welcome. He king Dasaratha thought that he has as enjoined by the sastras accomplished his objective by bringing him Rsyasringa. All the royal ladies, experienced immense delight when they saw the largeeyed Shanta arriving along with her husband Rsyasringa in that manner. Honoured and worshipped by royal ladies, especially by king Dasaratha, Santa dwelt there for some time comfortably with the sage Rsyasringa. : Thus ends the eleventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After a long time, at the advent of charming spring a desire arose in the mind of the king (Dasaratha) to perform the sacrifice. Then bowing Dasaratha's head in respect to that brahmin who was effulgent like a celestial and having won that brahmin's grace Dasaratha chose that brahmin to conduct a sacrifice for a son for (the continuity of) Dasaratha's dynasty. The wellhonoured brahmin agreed, saying, \"Be it so, let the requisite materials be procured and the sacificial horse, released\". Thereafter the king said to Sumantra, \"Summon immediately, Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali and Kasyapa, family priest Vasishta and other foremost and learned brahmins who are the official priests wellversed in the Vedas\". Thereafter the king said to Sumantra, \"Summon immediately, Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali and Kasyapa, family priest Vasishta and other foremost and learned brahmins who are the official priests wellversed in the Vedas\". Then Sumantra, a man of smart movement went immediately and brought all those brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas. After paying respect to those brahmins, virtuous king Dasaratha graciously uttered these words charged with dharma and artha. \"There is no happiness for Dasaratha. Dasaratha is overwhelmed with grief as Dasaratha has no son. Therefore, Dasaratha intends to perform a horsesacrifice. Dasaratha wishes to perform the yaga acording to scriptural procedures. And Dasaratha will have Dasaratha's desire fulfilled by the grace of the sage (Rsyasringa)\". When those brahmins heard these words from the king's month, those brahmins heades by Vasishta extolled the king's decision exclaiming, \"wellsaid\": The priests led by Rsyasringa replied to the king, saying, \"Let the sacrificial articles be procured and your sacrificial horse released.\" \"Since this righteous thought for begetting children has entered your mind, you shall surely get four sons of immense prowess\". Pleased to hear the brahmins' words, the king happily addressed his ministers with auspicious words: \"In accordance with the instructions by Dasaratha's spiritual preceptors let the articles (required for performing the sacrifice) be procured and the horse released under the protection of warriors accompanied by the chief priest\". Let a sacrificial pavillion be constructed on the northern bank of Sarayu according to prescribed methods ordained in the 'kalpa' and other scriptures for the uninterrupted completion of the sacrifice. If in this best of sacrifices aswamedha, obstructions and omissions do not occur it will be possible for the king to get the results. The learned brahmarakshasas always look out for flaws in the sacrifice so that they can strike into it. If the sacrifice is damaged, the doer of the sacrifice will be immediately destroyed. Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner by which this sacifice is completed in accordance with the prescriptions in scriptures and you are experts in doing so\". Honouring the words of the king, all the ministers did as ordered. Admiring the great king, the knower of righteousness, the brahmins permitted by Dasaratha returned to their places as they had some. When the great brahmins departed, the glorious king (Dasaratha) sent away his ministers and entered his palace. :2 Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After completion of one year when spring returned, the valiant king (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion to worship celestial beings for begetting sons. After offering humble salutations and worshipping sage Vasishta in accordance with prescribed ordinance for begetting children, Dasaratha obediently said: \"O foremost among ascetics O brahman, may the sacrifice be performed according to  tradition in such a manner that the sacrifice is performed unhindered. You are an affectionate friend and most reverential spiritual guide to Dasaratha. The burden of performing the sacrifice which has since commenced shall be borne by you\". The great among brahmins answered Dasaratha saying \"I shall do everything as proposed by Dasaratha\". Thereafter Vasishta summoned those brahmins who are experienced in the sacrificerelated activities venerable and righteous architects skilled workers brick makers, carpenters, diggers, artisans, account keepers, dancers and actors, men versed in scriptures and honest, wellinformed people and addressed them saying, \"In accordance with Dasaratha's command let the work of the sacrificial ceremony be inauguarated. Let thousands of bricks be brought. Let temporary residential buildings be erected with all the comforts to accommodate royal guests.\" Thereafter Vasishta summoned those brahmins who are experienced in the sacrificerelated activities venerable and righteous architects skilled workers brick makers, carpenters, diggers, artisans, account keepers, dancers and actors, men versed in scriptures and honest, wellinformed people and addressed them saying, \"In accordance with Dasaratha's command let the work of the sacrificial ceremony be inauguarated.

Let thousands of bricks be brought. Let temporary residential buildings be erected with all the comforts to accommodate royal guests.\" In the same manner let widely spread residential accommodation be furnished with many items of food and all kinds of entertainment be provided for people from other lands. In the same way people coming from rural areas also should be duly, not casualy treated with respect. People from all castes should be welltreated with respect. There should be no insult to any one through lust on greed on anger. The people deeply immersed in performing sacrificerelated activities and sculptors be specially honoured according to their nature of work. All of them should be satisfied with money and food. Every thing should be wellmanaged. In whatever manner you do, not even the smallest things be left out. Carry out the work with love and affection in your hearts\". Then all of them approached Vasishta and said, \"everything has been wellarranged in accordance with Vasishta's instruction. There is no deficiency. Everything will be done as instructed by Vasishta without leaving out anything.\" Then all of them approached Vasishta and said, \"everything has been wellarranged in accordance with Vasishta's instruction. There is no deficiency. Everything will be done as instructed by Vasishta without leaving out anything.\" Then Vasishta, having summoned Sumantra said to Sumantra \"Invite all the righteous kings on earth\". \"Extend an honourable invitation to brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants and sudras in their thousands residing in all countries. You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since king Janaka is an old ally, Vasishta is telling Sumantra in advance. You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since king Janaka is an old ally, Vasishta is telling Sumantra in advance. Similarly, you may personally escort king of Kasi who is always affectionate and sweettongued. He is a friend to Dasaratha who is a lion among rulers. Likewise bring here the aged and very righteous king of Kekaya along with his sons. He is fatherinlaw to Dasaratha who is a lion among kings. Bring with honour king of Anga, Romapada, famous and prosperous. He is an intimate friend of Dasaratha. Bring kings from the countries of the eastern and southern regions, from Sindhu, Sauvera and Saurashtra Bring all other kings of this earth, who are friendly with Dasaratha. Along with their retinues, families and relatives\". Having heard the words of Vasishta, Sumantra speedily despatched virtuous and auspicious emissaries to bring the kings. In accordance with the ascetic's order, righteous Sumantra himself quickly set out to escort Janaka and other kings. All the workers reported to the wise sage, Vasishta about the tasks completed for the sacrifice. Then, well pleased, the best among brahmins (Vasishta) said to them all \"Nobody should be offered any thing with disregard. Anything given with contempt undoubtedly  results in the destruction of the donor.\" Meanwhile kings from several countries to travelling nights and days arrived bringing with them various kinds of (precious) gifts. Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said \"O best among men, beacuse of Dasaratha's command, kings from various countries have arrived. Vasishta has extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station.\" Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said \"O best among men, beacuse of Dasaratha's command, kings from various countries have arrived. Vasishta has extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station.\" \"O king, persons with composed minds have made preparations for the yaga. Now be pleased to leave for sacrificial altar nearby to perform yaga. O foremost of kings, Dasaratha ought to see the sacrificial ground full of sources of entertainment arranged everywhere, as though improvised by imagination\". In response to the words of Vasishta and Rsyasringa, the Lord of the earth (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion on a favourable day presided over by an auspicious star. At that moment the best of brahmins led by Vasishta and headed by Rsyasringa, entered the sacrificial enclosure and began the sacrifice in accordance with traditions and scriptural stipulations.      : Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After completion of one year when the sacrificial horse had returned, the sacrifice by the king (Dasaratha) commenced on the northern bank of river Sarayu. The best of brahmins led by Rsyasringa performed the rituals of aswamedha organised by the exceedingly magnanimous king Dasaratha. The chief priests, masters of the Vedas, conducted the rituals in consonance with traditions and scriptures. They officiated in conformity with duties laid down in the Vedas and according to law. Brahmins performed pravargya and upasada and other ceremonies as per the scriptures and traditions. Thereafter the eminent ascetics, rejoicing in their hearts performed the worship (of celestial beings) and conducted the prescribed rituals starting with morning ablutions etc. Havis was duly offered to Indra daily. The juice was extracted in the morning by pressing the soma plant. Midday ablutions were performed. All in proper sequence. Those exceedingly noble and eminent brahmins performed third pressing of the soma, in conformity with the sastras. There were no omissions in the offerings nor any lappes in the performance. Everything was done through recitation of mantras and in a wholesome way. During the days (of sacrifice) none felt tired or hungry. There was no brahmin who was not learned or had less than a hundred followers (or disciples). During that period brahmanas as well as those who have masters, (the sudras), ascetics and monks had enough to eat. The aged, the sick, women and also children ate there and knew no limit to their enjoyment. \"Give food, give, various kinds of clothes\" echoed the organisers. And they (in charge of distribution) did. There, could be seen day after day heaps of nicely cooked food, looking like mountains. Men and women who had come from various countries to that sacrifice were entertained with food and drink by the magnanimous king Dasaratha. Brahmins having tasted the delicious food cooked in prescribed manner, praised saying \"Ah We are fully satisfied. Prosperity to you\". Such were the words heard by king Dasaratha. While brahmins were being served with food by welldressed men, some others wearing pendents studded with shining jewels assisted them. In the interval between ceremonies, eloquent and sagacious brahmins were engaged in various disputations, desirous of victory. Every day in that sacrifice brahmins, skilful in rituals, persuaded (by sage Vasishta), performed all their duties as per tradition. Here (in this sacrificial pavillion), there was none who was not versed in six Vedangas, not true to vows, not learned in many sastras nor adept in discussions (on sastras). When the time came to erect sacrificial posts, six posts, each made of bilva, khadira, parni, sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood, with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected. When the time came to erect sacrificial posts, six posts each made of bilva and khadira wood and many made of parni wood along, one of sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood, with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected. All these posts were prepared by knowers of sastras and by those wellversed in the performance of sacrifices. They were decorated with gold to add elegance to the sacrifice. These twentyone sacrificial posts, each measuring twentyone 'aratni' height, were welldecorated wrapped in a piece of cloth. All those posts, strong with eight sides and finely finished surfaces, wellcarved  by sculptors were duly erected. Decorated with flowers and sandal paste and covered with cloths, stood the  bright sacrificial posts shining like seven sages in the sky. The sacrificial fireplace was constructed with bricks with standard measurement by brahmins who were experts in the art of measuring land with a string or single strand. That sacrificial altar of the lion among kings, king Dasaratha, erected by welltrained brahmins was in the shape of the golden winged 'Garuda' it had three ranges and thrice as many fireplaces i.e eighteen in number. Animals, serpents and birds were kept ready after the sastras intended (for sacrifice) for those respective deities. When the time came to sacrifice the animals, the chief priests, in accordance with tradition, tied up the horse and all the aquatic animals to the sacrificial posts. Three hundred animals and the jewel of the horses (from the stables) belonging to king Dasaratha were bound to the sacrificial posts. Kausalya, with immense glee having gone round and worshipped that horse, severed it with three strokes of scimitar. Kausalya, in her devotion to duty and with a happy state of mind, passed one night near that horse. Hota, Adhvaryu and Udgata arranged Mahishi, Parivritti, Vavaata and another woman known as Palakali to touch (keep the company of) the sacrificial horse. The official priest, highly knowledgeable in scriptures and having restrained senses, removed the marrow from the horse and cooked it according to tradition. The king Dasaratha at appropriate time and in agreement with the scriptures inhaled the odour of the smoke (from the burnt marrow) and absolved himself of his sins. The sixteen officiating priests (brahmins) offered all the horse's limbs with prayers as per the customs. In other sacrifices oblations are offered with branches of a plaksha tree but in Aswamedha a branch of cane creeper is chosen instead. According to Kalpa sutra, aswamedha in conducted for three days. In the first day, chatushtoma is arranged. On the second day Ukthya and on the third day Atiraatra were performed. Many sacrifices fixed according to the scriptures were also performed. Jyotishtoma and Ayuryaga in Atiratra, Abhijit, Viswajit and Aptoryama ceremonies constituting the great sacrifice were performed in the prescribed manner. In order to promote his dynasty, king Dasaratha gave away eastern region to Hotar, western region to Adhvaryu, southern region to Brahma and northern region to Udgata. These offerings were made in accordance with theprescriptions by Brahma long all. In order to promote his dynasty, king Dasaratha gave away eastern region to Hotar, western region to Adhvaryu, southern region to Brahma and northern region to Udgata. These offerings were made in accordance with theprescriptions by Brahma long all. The king Dasaratha best among men and upholder of his dynasty, having concluded the sacrifice according to law, offered this entire earth as gift to priests. But all the priests said to the king Dasaratha purged of his sins, \"O Lord of men you alone are capable of protecting this earth\". \"O ruler of the earth We are constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas. We are not capable of ruling the earth and we cannot do anything with its possession. Give some other charity in lieu of that. O best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available. We have no use with this earth\". Lord of men, the king Dasaratha having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins. Lord of men, the king Dasaratha having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins. All the priests collectively offered that wealth to sage Rsyasringa and Vasishta endowed with prudence. Then those highly pleased brahmins, having distributed that wealth with equity, again said to the king Dasaratha. Thereafter, with earnestness king Dasaratha bestowed a crore of gold coins to brahmins who had come to see the sacrifice. Dasaratha then gave his excellent bracelet to a poor brahmin who solicited alms. When the brahmins were pleased, king Dasaratha who was fond of brahmins bowed to them with his eyes filled with delight. Brahmins uttered blessings upon the generous king Dasaratha when he prostrated before them according to procedure. Sacrifice destroys sins. It leads to heaven. It is incapable of being done by other monarchs. King Dasaratha was very much pleased after performing this great sacrifice. King Dasaratha then addressing Rsyasringa said \"O Adherent of vows you can help the continuity of my race\". Rsyasringa, the best of brahmins, addressing the king Dasaratha said, \"O King Let it be. Four sons perpetuating your race will be born to you\".      : Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Rsyasringa, a highly intellectual and knowledgeable one in the Vedas, pondered for a while, revived Rsyasringa's memory and said to the king. \"Rsyasringa shall perform putriyeshti to help you beget sons. This is to be done in accordance with tradition for fulfilment of desires through mantras as declared in a portion of the Vedas, 'atharva siras'\". To help Dasaratha beget sons, brilliant Rsyasringa commenced putriyeshti, a sacrifice for begetting children, by pouring oblations into sacrificial fire and chanting mantras in accordance with traditions. All the celestial deities etc., along with gandharvas according to tradition, gathered at the sacrifice to receive their share of offerings. All devatas assembled there as per tradition and thus addressed Lord Brahma the creator of the worlds: \"O lord a rakshasa by name Ravana who had obtained prowess through Lord Brahma's grace is oppressing us. We are unable to punish Ravana. Pleased with Ravana's penance, Lord, you had granted Ravana a boon. By honouring that boon and daily enduring all Ravana's cruelty. The evilminded Ravana is inflicting pains on the three worlds. Ravana hates the guardians of the earth and intends to assault Indra, lord of the celestials. Because of Lord Brahma's boon Ravana has become unassailable and puffed with pride deties sages, yakshas, gandharvas, demons and brahmins. The Sun does not scorch Ravana and the wind does not blow by Ravana. Even the ocean with its incessantly moving waves becomes still in Ravana's presence. Ravana's dreamful appearance of that rakshasa strikes terror into us. O Lord do find some means to kill Ravana\". After listening to the words of the devatas and reflecting over the matter, Brahma said, \"Oh, the means of destruction of that wicked (rakshasa) has struck my mind\". When Brahma asked gandharvas, yakshas, gods, demons or rakshasas should never be able to kill him, Brahma said, \"So be it\". \"The rakshasa did not include man monkey and bear because of Ravana's disdain for men. As such Ravana is fit to be destroyed by a man and not by any other means\". Having heard these pleasing words uttered by Brahma, all the devatas and maharshis were overwhelmed with joy. At this juncture Visnu the lord of the world, highly effulgent and bearing conch, discus and mace in Visnu's hands and in yellow apparel arrived. Lord Visnu stayed there with a composed mind after meeting Brahma Then thus spoke the devatas prostrated before Visnu and paying Visnu homage with hymns. \"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of king Dasaratha's three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame). \"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of king Dasaratha's three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame). \"O Visnu assuring human form, kill Ravana in the battle. Ravana has become a source of torment to the worlds and is invincible by gods. \"That stupid rakshasa, Ravana, with Ravana's haughty prowess, is terrorising the gods, gandharvas, siddhas and great rishis. It is reported that a cruel rakshasa with his haughty prowess has tortured rishis, gandharvas and apsaras sporting in Nandana groves. We siddhas, gandharvas and yakshas along with ascetics, have hence come here to devise ways of Ravana's death. We take refuge in you. O tormentor of enemies, O Visnu, you are the supreme, refuge for all of us. Resolve to be born in the world of men for the destruction of enemies of the gods (rakshasas)\". Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma. Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma. Lord Visnu, supreme soul having given boon to devatas in this manner, reflected as to the place where Visnu should take birth as a man in this world of men. Thereafter, the Lord with eyes like the lotus petal was pleased to transform himself into four forms and to choose king Dasaratha as Visnu's father. Then along with gandharvas, groups of apsaras, rishis, rudras and devatas sang in praise of the 'Lord Slayer of Madhu', with hymns of celestial beauty. \"Therefore, uproot that mighty Ravana possessing frightful prowess, inflamed pride, limitless insolence causing agony to the three worlds, a source of vexation to ascetics and a dreadful enemy of Indra. Kill Ravana, the cause of distress in the worlds, kill Ravana's forces and relatives. Them return to heaven protected by Indra after freeing from distress, faults and sins\". : Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Although Omniscient lord Narayana knew the means to be employed, when Narayana was requested by the best of devatas Narayana spoke to them softly: \"What strategies should be adopted in the matter of destruction of that evilminded Ravana who is a thorn to the sages?\". When the devatas were thus addressed by the imperishable Visnu, the devatas replied Visnu saying, \"Visnu may assume the form of a human being and slay Ravana in the battle\". \"O destroyer of foes Lord Brahma was very pleased with Ravana's intense penance over a long time Pleased, with the rakshasa Brahma granted a boon to the effect that except from men, there was, for Ravana, no fear of death from any other living beings. Ravana ignored men while seeking the boon. Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. Ravana carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes Ravana's death is possible by men only.\" Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. Ravana carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes Ravana's death is possible by men only.\" Having heard the words of devatas, selfpossessed Visnu chose king Dasaratha as his father. At that time, the brilliant king (Dasaratha), destroyer of enemies, who had no sons was performing a sacrifice for sons. After Visnu had decided (to incarnate) and Visnu was worshipped by devatas and maharshis Visnu disappeared bidding farewell to Brahma. During the sacrifice, there emerged from the sacrificial fire a mighty being with unmatched splendour, the mighty being's prowess and strength. The mighty being wore a black and crimson garment. The mighty being had a red face. The mighty being's voice was similar to the sounds of a drum. The mighty being had whiskers of soft and shining tawny hair resembling the mane of a lion The mighty being had fine hair on his head. The mighty being was endowed with auspicious signs and adorned with splendid divine ornaments. The mighty being's height resembled a mountain peak. The mighty being walked with the strides of a ferocious tiger. Similar to the Sun in radiance, the mighty being looked like the crest of a blazing fire.

Having seen king Dasaratha, the divine being said, \"O King Dasaratha you know the divine being has been sent by Prjapati (Brahma), and the divine being is here\". With folded palms the king replied, \"O revered lord. Welcome to you. What can I do for the divine being?\". Thereafter the one who came from Prajapati answered, \"O King Dasaratha you have obtained this payasam today in return for the worship offered to the devatas\". \"O Lion among kings, receive this payasam prepared by gods, conferring progeny, bestowing affluence and improving health. O King Dasaratha you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons. Give this to your  worthy consorts to consume it. They will bear you sons\". Dasaratha was pleased to receive respectfully the golden vessel filled with the payasam  prepared and bestowed by devatas. Overwhelmed with great joy, Dasaratha walked around that wonderful being of pleasant  countenance again and again and saluted the wonderful being respectfully. Dasaratha who received the payasam prepared by devatas was highly pleased like a poor man who received wealth. Then that effulgent figure of wonderful form having given the bowl of payasam vanished from there. The inner apartment, brightened with rays of happiness, shone like the autumnal sky in the glow of the moon. Dasaratha entered the inner apartment and addressing queen Kausalya said, \"Receive this payasam which has the power to give you sons\". Then Dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to Kausalya, half of the remaining half to Sumitra, half of the remaining portion (oneeighth of original) to Kaikeyi for the sake of a son. On further thinking, Dasaratha gave the remaining oneeighth portion to Sumitra. In this manner king Dasaratha divided and distributed the payasam among his wives separately.

                "When Visnu had decided to be born as the son of that great king (Dasaratha), the selfborn Lord (Brahma), addressed all devatas : Create strong and powerful beings capable of assuming forms at free will to extend support to Visnu who is true to his word, heroic and benevolent.

Earlier Jambavan, the foremost among bears was suddenly emerged out of my face while I was yawning. Instructed by Brahma in that manner, all of them gave birth to sons in the form of monkeys. Distinguished rishis, siddhas, vidhyadharas, uragas, charanas procreated (in the form of monkeys) heroic sons who became forestdwellers. Indra gave birth to Vali, chief of monkeys resembling Mahendra mountain and having a mighty body. Sun, great among those producing heat, begot Sugriva. Brihaspati begot the intelligent monkey Tara who had none to surpass him among the monkey chiefs. Kubera begot glorious Gandhamadana and Viswakarma begot a great monkey Nala. Neela, the prosperous son of Agni the firegod who equalled Agni the firegod in glow surpassed other monkeys in energy, renown and prowess. Aswini devatas, endowed with wealth and beauty, procreated Mainda and Dwivida who were highly esteemed for their beauty. Varuna begot the monkey warrior Sushena and Parjanya, Sarabha of great strength. Vayu, the windgod, begot a son named Hanuman, mighty and graceful, having a body as hard as a diamond and speed equal to Garuda's. Thousands of warriors possessing immeasurable strength and courage and capable of assuming any form at will were created to kill Ravana. Endowed with bodies similar to the Meru and Mandara mountains and having great strength, bears, monkeys, monkeys with cowtails quickly came into being. The sons of devatas retained characteristics like beauty, form and prowess of their procreator (gods). Some monkeys with acknowledged valour were born to female monkeys with tails. Similarly some other monkeys were born to female bears and female kinnaras. The devatas, rishis, gandharvas, garudas, yakshas, kimpurushas, siddhas, vidyadharas, uragas and many others were immensely pleased. Thousands of gigantic monkeys wandering in forests were procreated from principal apsarasas vidhyadaris, nagas, and gandharvas.

They possessed enormous strength and power to freely wander in forests. They were like lions and tigers in pride and prowess. They all could strike with rocks, use nails and teeth and trees as weapons. They were skilled in the use of all kinds of weapons. They could shake mountains and uproot deeprooted trees. With their speed they could cause disturbance to Samudra, the lord of the rivers. They could cause cleavage to this earth with their feet, cross the mighty ocean with one leap and enter the sky and even seize the clouds. They could capture wild elephants sojourning in the forest and make the flying birds drop down screaming. A crore of monkeys capable of assuming any form at will, great monkeys and commanders of monkey forces were created. Those monkey commanders created heroic monkeys among the chief monkey clans who later proved the best among clanleaders. Thousands of monkeys dwelt on the plateaus on the top of mountains abounding in bears. Some others inhabited various hills and forests. All those leaders, Nala, Neela, Hanuman and others dwelt near those two brothers Sugriva, the offspring of Surya and Vali, the son of Indra. Endowed with the might of Garuda and wellversed in warfare, all of them moving around tormented ferouious lions, tigers and mighty serpents. Mighty armed leader Vali endowed with immense prowess protected, with Vali's strong arms all those bears, gopuchhas(cowtailed) and monkeys. Born in many forms with various characteristics (relating to the body and tribe), they pervaded this earth with its mountains, forests and seas. In order to assist Rama, this earth was filled with commanders of those who led the monkey forces resembling masses of clouds and mountains. They loan endowed with immense strength and fearful forms and countenances. : Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Completed by the magnanimous king (Dasaratha). The aswamedha and putreshti sacrifices, the devatas received their share of havis and returned to their respective abodes. Having completed the prescribed vows (in respect of aswamedha), king Dasaratha together with his queens returned to the city of Ayodhya accompanied by his attendants, army and chariots. Having been honoured by the king (Dasaratha) in a befitting manner, the highly pleased lords of the earth (kings) made obeisance to the best of sages (Vasishta) and returned to their own countries. When the army of the kings left the city (Ayodhya) for their own, the armed forces shone bright and cheerfl. After the departure of the rulers, the exalted king Dasaratha preceded by the foremost of brahmins entered the city (of Ayodhya). Having been duly honoured by king Dasaratha, sage Rsyasringa with his wife Santa accompanied by the wise king Romapada and his followers set out for his country. When they (guests) all departed in this manner, Dasaratha with Dasaratha's desire fulfilled, Dasaratha's thought centred on begetting sons lived happily. Six seasons (one year) passed after the completion of the sacrifice. In the twelfth month of Chaitra on the ninth day (of the bright fortnight), with Aditi as presiding deity when the star Punarvasu was in the ascendent and the five planets Sun, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus, were exalted in their own house in karkata lagna, when Brihaspati was in conjunction with the Moon, Kausalya gave birth to a son: a facet of Visnu, Lord of the entire universe who received obeisance from all the worlds and was adorned with all auspicious signs, the venerable one to perpetuate the Ikshvaku race.

Kausalya glowed with the undiminished lustre of Kausalya's son, just as Aditi with Aditi's son Indra, the foremost among the gods and the wielder of thunder. As an incarnation of the fourth part of Visnu, imbued with all virtues, and armed with truth Bharata was born to Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Satrughna who were heroic, skilled in the use of all weapons and endowed with the facets of Visnu. Bharata endowed with pure intellect was born in meena lagna when pushya was in the ascendant. Lakshmana and Satrughna were born in karkata lagna with the star aslesha. Four worthy sons were successively born to the noble king (Dasaratha), endowed with all virtuous, resembling purvabhadra and uttarabhadra stars in brightness. The gandharvas sang melodiously. Groups of apsaras danced. Celestial kettledrums were sounded. Flowers were showered from the sky. Men througed to Ayodhya to witness the festivities. The gandharvas sang melodiously. Groups of apsaras danced. Celestial kettledrums were sounded. Flowers were showered from the sky. Men througed to Ayodhya to witness the festivities. The highways were crowded with men, thronged by actors and dancers. The voices of singers, performers on different instruments, eulogists and genealogists reverberated. The king distributed deserving gifts to priests, euologists and genealogists. Dasaratha gave brahmins in charity thousands of cows and other valuables. After a lapse of eleven days, the naming ceremony was performed. Highly delighted preceptor Vasishta named Kausalya's son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, one son of Sumitra, Lakshmana and the other Satrughna. After a lapse of eleven days, the naming ceremony was performed. Highly delighted preceptor Vasishta named Kausalya's son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, one son of Sumitra, Lakshmana and the other Satrughna. Brahmins as well as inhabitants of the city and rural areas were feasted. (Dasaratha) bestowed on brahmins unlimited and abundant jewels in charity. The rites at the time of birth and all other rites (associated with the newborn) were duly performed. Among them, Rama like the exalted flag, became dear to his father like Brahma he was highly respected by all living beings. All the sons (of Dasaratha) became wellversed in the Vedas. They were heroic, endowed with knowledge and virtues and were devoted to the welfare of the people. Among them the highly lustrous and truly mighty Rama was stainless (in character). Rama was auspicious to the entire world like the Moon. Accepted as skilled in mounting elephants, riding horses, driving chariots and also in archery, Rama was always emgaged in the service of his parents. Right from his very childhood Lakshmana, an enhancer of fortune, always remained very attached to his eldest brother Rama, the delight of the world. Lakshmana, possessed of fortune, was the dearest to his brother Rama than his own body. As though Lakshmana was his life without. Rama, the greatest among men would not sleep without Lakshmana's company. Rama would not partake even the choicest food minus Lakshmana to him. Whenever Raghava (Rama) went hunting into the forest, riding the horse, Lakshmana used to follow Raghava holding bow and arrows (in his hand). In a similar manner Satrughna, younger brother of Lakshmana, became dearer than his own life to Bharata. Similarly, Bharata also was dear to Satrughna. With his very fortunate sons, Dasaratha was highly pleased like Brahma was with the gods. All his sons were enriched with knowledge and endowed with all virtues. They were modest, renowned, omniscient and farsighted. Dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like Brahma, Lord of the worlds. All his sons were enriched with knowledge and endowed with all virtues. They were modest, renowned, omniscient and farsighted. Dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like Brahma, Lord of the worlds. They (like) tigers among men, were fond of the study of the Vedas and were always engaged in the service of their parents. They were also proficient in the science of archery. Then the virtuous king Dasaratha deliberated with his priests and kinsmen about the marriage of his sons. While the nobleminded king was thus deliberating in the midst of his counsellors, there arrived the effulgent ascetic Viswamitra. Desirous of seeing the king (Dasaratha) Viswamitra accosted the doorkeepers, saying \"Inform the king quickly about the arrival of Viswamitra, the son of Gadhi born in the line of Kusika\". On hearing those words (of Viswamitra) all of them prompted by fear because of left for the royal apartment with excited minds and hurried steps. Having reached the royal hall, they reported to the king (Dasaratha), descendant of the Ikshvakus about the arrival of sage Viswamitra. Having heard their words, Dasaratha in great joy went forth together with his preceptors to receive Viswamitra like Indra receiving Brahma. Seeing Viswamitra, shining with the power of his penance fulfilled the king with a cheerful countenance made offerings with due respect. Viswamitra received the offerings as ordained in the scriptures and enquired from the king about the welfare and prosperity of his kingdom. The exceedingly virtuous sage Viswamitra enquired from the king about the treasury welfare of his subjects living in cities and villages, and the well being of his friends and relatives. Are the tributary kings submissive to you? Have you conquered your enemies? Are the rites for propitiating gods and the services to humanity performed rightly? The foremost of ascetis, Viswamitra approached Vasishta and all other distinguised sages following the protocal and enquired about their welfare. All of them with gladdened hearts entered the royal palace and sat down, in accordance with their position after having been duly honoured by the king. Then the munificent king, very much (at Viswamitra's arrival) pleased offered Viswamitra a happy hospitality and spoke: \"O great sage, welcome to you Your arrival, to me, is like nectar (to a human being), rains to the parched land, birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife, recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt. \"O great sage, welcome to you Your arrival, to me, is like nectar (to a human being), rains to the parched land, birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife, recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt. \"O Brahman! what is your desire and in what manner shall I fulfill it to your satisfaction? You are a role model for righteousness. How fortunate I am you have come! My birth is rendered fruitful. My life has accomplished its objective. \"O Brahman! what is your desire and in what manner shall I fulfill it to your satisfaction? You are a role model for righteousness. How fortunate I am you have come! My birth is rendered fruitful. My life has accomplished its objective. Earlier you were rajarshi, a warrior sage. By your austerities you have obtained the brilliance that lends radiance even to the Sun and the Moon you have gained the status of a brahmrshi. In several ways you are worthy of my worship. O Brahman your arrival has caused surprise to me. It has conferred great purity on me. O Lord by your very presence here, I feel I haved acquired the merits of a pilgrimage. Be pleased to tell me the purpose of your visit. I desire to be given the privilege of doing service to achieve your object. O Viswamitra you need not hesitatate to tell me what ought to be performed. I shall accomplish that act in every possible special way. You are a god to me. O Brahmin I have attained this high foutune today. My great merit has been realised as a result of your arrival\". On hearing the words spoken in such an humble manner by the prudent king words pleasing to the mind and to the ears, the great rishi of celebrated virtues and fame, of sterling qualities experienced deep delight. : Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Having heard these wonderful words of Dasaratha, the lion among kings, the brilliant Viswamitra with hair on end replied: \"O Tiger among kings having been born on earth in an illustrious lineage and initiated by Vasishta, this way (of speaking) befits you. It cannot be any other way. O Tiger among kings I shall unfold the purpose conceived in my mind. Take a decision and be truthful to your promise. O best among men for the successful completion of a sacrifice I took up a selfimposed  religious observance. Two rakshasas, capable of assuming forms at will, are creating impediments to that sacrifice. When my sacrifice generally speaking, is nearing completion the powerful and welltrained Maricha and Subahu who are raining streams of blood and flesh upon the altar. The (solemn) vow for observance of religious rites being thus interrupted, I left that country as an exerted and discouraged man. O King my mind does not permit me to vent my wrath. The nature of sacrifice is such that I refrain from cursing them. O tiger among kings it is befitting of you to entrust your eldest son Rama to me who is valiant, young (having sidelocks of hair) and true to his prowess. Protected by me and by Rama's own divine power, Rama is capable of destroying even those demons causing impediments to the sacrifice. I will confer upon Rama, without doubt, a lot of blessings for Rama's wellbeing by which Rama will attain fame in all the three worlds. Both of them (Maricha and Subahu) will not be able to withstand Rama in any way. Rama, and Rama alone, is capable of destroying them. Proud of their strength, the two wicked demons have been noosed by Yama, the god of death. O tiger among kings they are no match for the magnanimous Rama. \"O king it is not proper for you to hesitate because of your paternal affection. You need to know that both the rakshasas will perish. This, I assure you. I know Rama who is a great soul, true to his prowess and also Vasishta of great lustre and these other sages who have been steadfast in asceticism also know. O king of kings, if you are seeking the benefits of righteousness, great everlasting fame in this world, it is fit and proper to give Rama to me. O Kakustha if your counsellors and all other sages headed by Vasishta give their consent, then only you may relieve Rama. You should spare your dear son, the lotuseyed Rama, impartial and detached, for ten nights. O (Dasaratha), descendant of Raghu act in such a manner that the time for my sacrifice is not delayed. Do not indulge in grief. Prosperity to you\" After speaking these words charged with dharma and artha the great sage resplendent Viswamitra fell silent. Having listened to those auspicious words of Viswamitra, the king among kings, (Dasaratha) experienced intense grief out of fear. He became despondent. The great king felt shaken off his throne after listening to the words of the sage (Viswamitra) which broke his heart and terribly upset his mind.       : Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing Viswamitra, words the tiger among kings (Dasaratha) lost his senses for a moment and on regaining his consciousness spoke this way. \"My lotuseyed son Rama is less than sixteen. I do not think Rama has ability to fight with the rakshasas in a battle. Here is the whole akshauhini (army) of which Dasaratha am the lord and sustainer. Accompanied by the akshauhini Dasaratha shall engage those rakshsasas in the battle. These servants of mine are warriors, valiant, powerful and courageous, skilled in the use of weapons and fit to engage multitude of rakshasas in battle. It is not proper to take Rama with you. Wielding bow in hand Dasaratha will protect the sacrifice. As long as Dasaratha's life sustains, Dasaratha will engage the rakshasas in the battle. Dasaratha shall go there, protect the sacrifice and see that it is conducted without obstacles. It is not proper to take Rama with you. Rama is still a child, Rama is not learned in the science of warfare, Rama does not know the strength and weakness of enemies. Rama has not acquired as yet the strength of using weapons and is not proficient in warfare. You know certainly those rakshasas are deceitful in battle. And hence Rama is not qualified to oppose them in the battle succesfully. Separated from Rama, Dasaratha do not like to live even for a moment. O tiger among ascetics, it is not proper to take Rama with you. O sage of great vows, O brahman if at all you intend to take Rama with you, take Dasaratha also along with my army. O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since Dasaratha was born. Rama was born to Dasaratha after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take Rama with you. Dasaratha's love for Rama among all my four sons is supreme.It is not proper for you to take Rama, the eldest son whose prime qualification is his virtue. O best of sages, how powerful are those rakshsas? Whose sons are they? Who are they and how huge is their body? Who are protecting them? O brahman, how to rebuff those deceitful warriors either through Rama or through Dasaratha's army or through Dasaratha? O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess\". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said: O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess\". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said: Ravana, king of rakshasas, is the brother of Kubera and son of ascetic Visravana. Ravana is said to possess great prowess. Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by Ravana to cause obstacles\". Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by Ravana to cause obstacles\". Informed in this manner by sage Viswamitra, king Dasaratha addressed the sage, saying, \"Dasaratha am not competent enough to stand before those evilminded rakshasas in the batlle\". \"You are the knower of righteousness. Extend your favour to my little son and also to Dasaratha for Dasaratha am so who is unfortunate. You are verily Dasaratha's spiritual preceptor and god. Gods, danavas, gandharvas, yakshas, birds and great serpents cannot withstand Ravana in battle. What are men to Ravana? (They are no match to Ravana). That rakshasa pulls out warriors' prowess in the battle. O foremost of ascetics Either with forces or with Dasaratha's sons it is not possible for Dasaratha to engage Ravana or his forces in battle. O brahman although my son resembles the celestials he is not experienced in warfare. On no account shall Dasaratha spare Rama. Further the sons of Sunda and Upasunda by name Maricha and Subahu are causing obstacles to your sacrifice. They resemble the god of death, Yama. Dasaratha shall never part with his son. Maricha and Subahu not only possess prowess but also are experienced in warfare. Together with Dasaratha's group of friends Dasaratha can combat with one of the two\". Having heard the statements of the king the son of Kusika, Viswamitra who was like Indra among the ascetics was seized by great anger. As though fire in the form of maharshi blazed like the sacrificial fire into which oblations of clarified butter have been poured. i ph E nE Ehb M ity rmadra vmkya iky bak viassarga Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Out of affection towards Rama, Dasaratha's plea to Viswamitra was full of contradiction. And on hearing Dasaratha, enraged Viswamitra replied: O king, if this act of yours is appropriate to you, I will go back (to the places) where from I came. O scion of the race of kakutstha, you have proved false to your promise. Live happily with your relatives\". At the sight of the wise sage Viswamitra seized of wrath, the entire earth shook and devatas were gripped in fear. Great Vasishta, an adherent of ascetic practices and steadfast (to duty), seeing that the entire world frightened addressed Dasaratha, saying: \"Born in the line of Ikshvaku, you are a veritable the second god of righteousness, firm adherent of vows auspicious and virtuous. It is not right on your part to abandon your promise. O Dasaratha you are reputed in the three worlds as righteousminded. Do your own duty. Do not follow an unjust act which is unworthy of respect. O Dasaratha, a promise made and not kept amounts to destruction of merits earned through previous pieties. Therefore send Rama (with him). Trained or not in the use of arms, as long as Rama is protected by Viswamitra, just as nectar is protected by the flaming firegod rakshasas will not be able to compete with Rama. This Viswamitra is an embodiment of righteousness and unsurpassed among the powerful. None can excel Viswamitra in intellect in this world. Viswamitra is the supreme refuge in austerity. This Viswamitra knows the use of various kinds of weapons which no one knows among the animate and the inanimate in the three worlds. Nor will any one even know in future. No gods nor sages nor asuras in rakshasas nor kinnaras nor mighty serpents nor gandharvas nor the best of yakshas (will be able to know) All these weapons were given to Viswamitra by Bhrisasva's highly virtuous sons while he was ruling the kingdom. Grandsons (daughter's sons) of Prajapati, they (these weapons) are in diverse forms, highly energetic and full of glory they bring victory. Jaya and Suprabha of slender waists are the two daughters of Daksha. They gave birth to one hundred effulgent sons known as astras and shastras. Formerly Jaya, for the destruction of the army of asuras gave birth to fifty sons by virtue of a boon. They possess immeasurable power of changing forms at will. Suprabha gave birth to another fifty sons named Samharas who are unassailable, invincible and more powerful. Viswamitra is well conversant with these weapons. Being virtuous, Viswamitra is capable of creating new weapons also. Such is the prowess of Viswamitra who is a highly effulgent and highly renowned sage. O King in sending Rama, you need not entertain any doubt. Son of Kusika, even though capable of repressing those rakhsasas by himself, it is for the welfare of Rama that Viswamitra is here requesting you to spare him\". Satisfied in his mind at the words of the sage Vasishta, the full one among the Raghus' (Dasaratha) one with wide reputation, Dasaratha's frame shining gave his cheerful consent to the son of Kusika for Rama's departure. : Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Vasishta having said thus, king Dasaratha, with cheerful countenance summoned Rama and Lakshmana.

The departure of glorious Viswamitra was greeted with incessant showers of flowers, the beating of celestial drums and the blowing of conches. Viswamitra walked in the forefront. Behind Viswamitra was Rama, bow in hand, while in the archer, Sumitra's son (Lakshmana) with side locks of hair followed. Rama and Lakshmana equipped with bows and quivers resembled three hooded serpents. Warriors of no less prowess, they illuminated the ten quarters and followed the high souled Viswamitra like twin Aswanikumaras following the grandsire, Brahma.

After crossing a distance of over half a yojana on the southern bank of Sarayu, Viswamitra addressed Rama sweet in a gentle voice. \"O child, take this water (in your hands), let there be no delay. Rama will receive from Viswamitra a collection of mantras and also bala and atibala. \"(If Rama receives these mantras), Rama will experience neither fatigue, nor fever nor will there be a change in Rama's appearance. Whether Rama is asleep or agitated, rakshasas cannot harm Rama. O Rama, there is none in this world equal to the might of Rama's hands nor does such a person exist in the three worlds. O sinless one, there is none in this world equal to Rama in good fortune, kindness, wisdom, in taking a decsion or giving a reply. With these two kinds of knowledge secured, there will be none equal to Rama, at present or in fututre. Bala and atibala are mother to all kinds of knowledge . O Rama, best among men, scion in the line of Raghu, on Rama's way Rama will not feel hunger or thirst if Rama recites bala and atibala. O Rama, born in the line Kakutstha and one who is righteous, these two radiant sciences are daughters of the grandsire Brahma. If Rama pursues these two sciences, Rama will get unequalled fame. Rama is a fit person to confer these two sciences. Rama possesses all these qualities in great measure. There is no doubt that If these two sciences (mantras) are nourished with austerities they will assume multiple forms (and benefit Rama)\". Thereafter Rama, touched the water and was sanctified. With a cheerful face Rama received those two sciences from the maharshi who had perceived the supreme soul. .

                "When the night turned into daybreak, the eminent ascetic Viswamitra, addressing the descendants of Kakutstha (Rama and Lakshmana) who were lying on a bed of leaves said: \"O beloved son of Kausalya, O Rama the day dawns. O best among men, awake, oblations to gods and other sacred rites are required to be performed\". On hearing the very affectionate call of Viswamitra both the brave princes had their bath and offered oblations to Sungod (standing in the water) and recited the holy name of the Lord. On performing the morning rites, the two highly powerful and and energetic princes stood before Viswamitra who was richly endowed with asceticism. They prostrated before Viswamitra. And stood ready for their onward journey. Thereafter, having gone a little further both the heroic brothers looked at the confluence of holy  Sarayu with  divine Ganga divided into three branches. There they saw a sacred hermitage of anchorites of great vitality performing severe austerities for thousands of years. Exceedingly delighted to see the sacred hermitage, the two princes enquired from the illustrious sage Viswamitra: \"O worshipful one, whose sacred hermitage is this? Who lives here? Indeed, we are curious to know\". On having heard their words, the foremost of sages gently smiled and said, \"O Rama listen, who this hermitage belonged to in the past\". \"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned. The wicked Kama on his way with the maruts (god of wind) insulted Siva, the god of gods, while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort. On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at Kama (menacingly). \"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned. The wicked Kama on his way with the maruts (god of wind) insulted Siva, the god of gods, while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort. On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at Kama (menacingly). \"O descendant of Raghu, burnt down by Siva's fierce (third) eye, all the limbs of the body of that evilminded Kama were consumed. Having been completely burnt down by Lord Siva, Kama's body was destroyed. Mighty angry, Siva, reduced Kama to a 'disembodied being. O descendant of the Raghus, from that time onwards, Kama was known as 'Ananga' (one without form). The  beautiful place where Kama gave up his body is known as Angadesa. This holy hermitage belongs to Kama. These ascetics are Kama's disciples. They are  always righteous and are free from sin. O auspiciouslooking Rama, we will stay here tonight at the confluence of both these sacred rivers (Sarayu and Ganga) and cross over Ganga tomorrow. O best of men, after morning ablutions offering oblations to the sacred fire, all of us sanctified will enter this pious hermitage\". As they were conversing thus, the ascetics, with their far reaching spiritual vision (beyond the veil of time) recognised Rama and Lakshmana and were immensely pleased. After extending hospitality to the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) with respectful offerings, and water for washing feet they played the host to Rama and Lakshmana. Having received due hospitality, Rama and Lakshmana delighted the ascetics with their talk. The rishis with composed minds recited their evening prayer as usual. The ascetics who resided there, faithful to their vows, took Rama and Lakshmana in. There Rama and Lakshmana staed happily  in Kama's hermitage. Foremost among the ascetics the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) delighted the charming princes with enchanting tales.      : Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter the destroyers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana offering their morning oblations on that bright dawn arrived at the bank of the river (Ganga) with Viswamitra ahead of them. All the highminded ascetics and strict followers of vows secured an auspicious boat for them and addressed Viswamitra, saying: With the princes ahead of you, board the boat. Tread the safe path. Let there be no loss of time. \"Be it so\", said Viswamitra and paid respect to all those sages. And accompanied by them (Rama and Lakshmana), crossed the river flowing towards the sea. As they reached the midstream, Rama and Lakshmana heard a sound greatly  augmented by the speed (of the river). Rama enquired of Viswamitra, the best of sages, \"What is this tumultuous sound  bursting out of the waters?\" At the words of Rama filled with curiosity, the righteous (Viswamitra) narrated the true nature of that sound. \"O tiger among men, Rama. Brahma created out of his mind a lake on mount Kailas and so that lake is called Manasa (Sarovara). This river which flows from Manasa Sarovara is, therefore, known as 'Sarayu'. It surrounds  Ayodhya. This sacred river flows from that lake of Brahma. When Ganga approaches this river (Sarayu), there is a clash of waters and this great noise is produced. Rama, offer respectful salutations here, with a calm mind\". Deeply religious (in nature) they both made obeisance to the two rivers and reached the southern bank and advanced with quick steps. He who was a descendent of Ikshvaku and son of the best of kings, (Dasaratha) having seen that untrodden and dreadful forest asked the foremost of the ascetics: \"What a wonder This inaccessible forest echoes with the (shrill) chirpings of crickets It is filled with ferocious beasts and birds producing fearful sounds. \"It resounds with the frightful shricks of various kinds of birds. Lions, tigers, boars and elephants prowl about. This forest jampacked with dhava, ashvakarna, kakubha, bilva, tinduka, patala and badari trees, how frightening this forest could be\" Viswamitra, the great sage radiating energy addressing Rama said, \"O child of kakusthsa dynasty I shall tell you whose dreadful forest this is. Listen\" O best among men, formerly these two large and prosperous cities called Malada and Karusha built by celestial architects existed. O Rama, in ancient times after killing Vritrasura, Indra was overpowered by the sin of slaying a brahmin and was affected by impurity and hunger. Devas and rishis endowed with the wealth of asceticism bathed Indra with the (consecrated) waters (brought from all rivers) from the pitchers and got him cleansed of impurities. With the hunger and the taint and impurity from the body of Mahendra removed at this place, the devas rejoiced. Cleansed of his impurities and his hunger gone, Indra once again became pure. Allpowerful Indra highly pleased gave an excellent boon to that region. Indra blessed the place saying, 'Having absorbed impurities of my body, let these places be extremely fertile and prosperous and let this be renowned throughout this world as Malada and Karusha'. Having seen the honour bestowed on that land by the wise Indra, the gods said to him, 'Well done, Well done'. O Destroyers of enemies these prosperous townships, Malada and Karusha looked cheerful with (bumper) crops and wealth for a long time. Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka, wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place. Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka, wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place. The arms (of Maricha) are round and strong. He is highly energetic. He has a large face and a huge body. In appearance, he is gigantic and possesses a dreadful form. That rakshasa always threatened the inhabitants. \"O Rama that wicked than Tataka carried on her depredations at regular intervals in these locations, Malada and Karusha. Tataka lives at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here obstructing the path. Since Tataka dwells in this forest, no one comes here (because of fears). \"By  the strength of Rama's arms slay this one of wicked deeds. Comply with Viswamitra's orders and make this country safe (and habitable). O Rama none dare approach this country ravaged by such dreadful, intolerable yakshini. You have been told the manner in which this fierce forest is entirely ruined by that cruel yakshini. Tell now she has not left this place\".      : Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the excellent words of Viswamitra, a sage with unimaginable faculty. Rama replied in a, gentle voice: \"O best of ascetics, I have heard the yakshas possess little prowess. How can Tataka who is by gender weak possess the strength of a thousand elephants? Viswamitra said, \"Listen, how Tataka acquired the prowess and strength by virtue of a boon she received. \"In the past there was a powerful and great yaksha by name Suketu. Suketu had no  children. So Suketu performed an intense penance following virtuous practices. Rama the grandsire Brahma was highly gratified and granted to the king of yakshas, the gem of a daughter by name known asTataka. The illustrious grandsire Brahma granted Tataka the strength of a thousand elephants, but did not bestow a son on the yaksha. As Tataka grew up, glowing with youth and beauty Tataka was given in marriage to Sunda, son of Jharjha. After some time that yakshini gave birth to an unassailable son by name Maricha. Because of a curse, Maricha became a rakshasa (though born of yaksha parentage). O Rama when Sunda died Tataka along with Maricha wanted to attack Agastya, the best of sages. Roaring, Tataka rushed with excitement to devour him. The venerable  rishi Agastya saw Tataka approaching him and cursed Maricha to assume form of a demoness. Mighty angry, Agastya cursed Tataka saying, 'Abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi, a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance'. Mighty angry, Agastya cursed Tataka saying, 'Abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi, a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance'. Enraged at the curse, senseless, Tataka with anger, has been ravaging this sacred land when Agastya walked. O Rama for the welfare of cows and brahmins, slay this yakshini who is wicked, extremely cruel and possessing vile prowess. O son of Raghu's dynasty Tataka is maligned by the curse, and so not a single man in the three worlds except Rama, is  competent to slay this yakshini. O best among men Rama need not hate killing a woman. Rama is a prince. Rama should serve the interest of the four orders of the society. Whether cruel or kind, sinful or wrong whatever contributes to the protection of the subjects, should be done by the righteous (king). This is the eternal law binding those who are appointed to bear the burden of a kingdom. O Kakutstha kill Tataka. Tataka knows no dharma. O Prince It is heard that in the past Indra slew Manthara, Virochana's daughter who intended to destroy the earth. 'O Rama! In olden times, Kavya, the mother of Sukracharya, the wife of sage Bhrigu, was destroyed by Vishnu determined to destroy Indra.' O Prince by these magnanimous persons and by great men several unrighteous women were killed for the common good\".      : Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "After listening to the manly command of ascetic Viswamitra, Rama, of the lineage of Raghu, the son of the foremost of men and firm in determination, replied with folded palms: \"As Rama have to fulfill the command of Rama's father and honour Rama's words and the instruction of Kausika (Viswamitra), Rama shall execute it (kill Tataka) without hesitation. In Ayodhya in the presence of elders and spiritual masters (of Dasaratha's court), Rama have been ordered by Rama's magnanimous father to act according to your instructions  and his words cannot be disobeyed. As per the words of Rama's father and the command of Viswamitra, who has the knowledge of the Brahman,  Rama shall execute the welcome act of killing Tataka. For the welfare of cows and brahmins and also for the good of this country, Rama am ready to perform such acts as commanded by you of  boundless energy\". Rama, the destroyer of enemies having said so clinched the middle of the bow with Rama's fist and filled the ten quarters with the resounding twanging of the bowstring. The dwellers of the Tataka forest were terrified by the sound (of the bow). Tataka, was might angry and amazed. Hearing that sound, the demoness thought for a while and senseless with anger  rushed in the direction where the sound had come from. Filled with wrath Rama saw Tataka, disfigured with a distorted face and gigantic in size. Turning to Lakshmana he said : \"O Lakshmana, behold, the sight of the dreadful hideous body of this yakshini will break timid hearts. See, she is unassailable because of the strength gained through black magic. Rama shall cut off her ears and the tip of Rama's nose and make her turn away. By virtue of being a woman, she is protected. Rama am not inclined to slay her but take away her prowess and power of motion\". While Rama was still speaking, Tataka, incensed with fury rushed with her uplifted arms towards Rama roaring. Brahmarshi Viswamitra threatened her with hunkara (menacing sound), uttering, \"Auspices to the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) be aupicousness and success\" victorious. Tataka raising a cloud of frightening dust left the descendants of Raghu bewildered quite for a moment. Then invoking the power of magic, she showered extensive rain of boulders on both the descendants of Raghu. Rama was enraged at this. Rama retaliated that mighty rain of rocks with a volley of arrows. While she was advancing towards Rama, he cut off her hands. When she was tired and roaring in a nearby place with her hands chopped off, Lakshmana cut off her ears and the tip of her nose in indignation. Capable of assuming forms at will, that yakshini intending to delude the princes through her power of magic, vanished from the sight. She then assumed various forms and released a rain of rocks. And started moving about frightfully. On seeing them hit and thrown about by a rain of stones from all sides, the  auspicious son of Gadhi, (Viswamitra) spoke these words: \"O Rama she does not deserve any more compassion. This yakshini who is sinful, wicked and obstructor of sacrifice will regain her strength by her magical powers \". Kill her, for dusk is fast approaching. During evening the strength of rakshasas tends to increase and they become unassailable\". Addressed thus (by Viswamitra), Rama attacked her exhibiting Rama's skill in targetting her by the sound and prevented with arrows the yakshini from showering  stones. . Prevented by a multitude of arrows, she with her magical powers, advanced towards Rama and Lakshmana roaring. Her chest pierced with an arrow, she rushing menacingly towards them like a thunderbolt fell down dead. Having seen the slain yakshini of terrible appearance, Indra and other celestials worshipped Rama, exclaiming \"well done, well done \". Then exceedingly pleased the thousandeyed Indra and all other delighted celestials  said to Viswamitra: \"O ascetic Kausika, may prosperity be to you All devatas have been gratified by this act (of Rama) and have expressed their love for Rama. \"O Brahmarshi, you may offer to Rama, the sons of  Prajapati Brishasva who are the weapons bestowed with the power that comes from truth and ascetic energy\". \"O Brahmarshi following you with firmness of mind, Rama is worthy to receive the weapons. He who is a prince has to accomplish many such great tasks for the benefit of the celestials\". Having said these words, the celestials were pleased. They honoured Viswamitra and returned to their abodes from where they had come. And then dusk set in. Then, the best of ascetics Viswamitra rejoiced over the death of Tataka, kissed the forehead of Rama (fondly) and spoke these words: \"O auspiciouslooking Rama tonight we shall stay here. Tomorrow morning we proceed to my hermitage\". Having heard the words of Viswamitra, Rama rejoiced and rested happily that night in the Tataka forest . Freed from the curse from that day that forest looked charming and shone like Chitraratha Kubera's (garden). Rama having killed the daughter of yaksha was praised by multitudes of devatas and siddhas. Rama stayed in the same forest with the sage. At the first glimpse of dawn, Rama was awakened by the sage (Viswamitra).      :7 Thus ends the twentysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The night over, illustrious Viswamitra called Rama with a sweet smile. \"O prince of great renown, Viswamitra is extremely pleased. May Rama prosper Out of great love and affection for Rama Viswamitra shall make over all the weapons. With the help of these celestial weapons, Rama will vanquish even gods and demons, serpents together with gandharvas if they challenge Rama to a battle as enemies and take them as captives. Viswamitra shall confer on Rama all such weapons. May Rama prosper Mighty armed, heroic Rama Viswamitra shall grant Rama the great celestial dandachakra.

Viswamitra, the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned east and happily, conferred on Rama collection of the unique mantras. The sage offered Rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire. While the sagacious ascetic Viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras (addressing their respective deities), all these weapons (with their mystic power) attended on Rama. The munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to Rama saying, \"Here Rama are, at Rama's disposal \". Rama received the astras Rama felt with Rama's hands and commanded them saying, \"Live in Rama's mind\" (serve Rama whenever Rama remembers you). Thereafter, the cheerful Rama, bowed to the mighty ascetic Viswamitra and commenced Rama's journey.

                "After performing the purificatory rites, Rama received the weapons with a cheerful face. In the way Rama said to Viswamitra. \"O venerable one, having received these weaponsRama have become unassailable even by the celestials.

                "The highly lustrous Viswamitra heard the words of Rama of immeasurable prowess. On Rama's query about the forest, Viswamitra explains. \"O mightyarmed Rama Lord Visnu, the foremost among the gods, and master the great ascetic lived here carrying out yogic practices and penance for innumerable years  constituting hundreds of yugas. \"O Rama this was the hermitage of glorious Vamana. The great sage Vamana performed Vamana's ascetic pratices here, hence it is known as siddhashrama. \"During the period Visnu (in the incarnation of Vamana) was observing austerities at this hermitage, king Bali, son of Virochana, having vanquished Indra and maruts and devatas ruled this kingdom and became famous in all the three worlds (for king Bali's prowess and generosity.) \"During the period Visnu (in the incarnation of Vamana) was observing austerities at this hermitage, king Bali, son of Virochana, having vanquished Indra and maruts and devatas ruled this kingdom and became famous in all the three worlds (for king Bali's prowess and generosity.) \"While king Bali was performing the sacrifice (to confirm king Bali's position as lord of the three worlds), the devas got together with Agni in the forefront and approached Lord Visnu at this hermitage, saying: 'O Visnu son of Virochana is performing a great sacrifice.

Your soul is tapas. O Purushottama I am beholding you after a rigorous penance. \"O Lord I am beholding this entire universe in your body. You are beginningless and  indescribable. I take refuge in you\". Addressing Kasyapa whose sins had been washed clean, Lord Visnu pleased (with Kasyapa's penance) said: \"Be prosperous you are dear to me. Worthy of a boon. Ask.\" Having heard those words of Vishnu, Kasyapa, son of Maricha, replied, \"O bestower of boons, O great practitioner of austerities Be pleased to grant a boon for Aditi, devatas and for myself. \"O Sinless Lord, Be born son to Aditi and to me, O Destroyer of asuras, be the younger brother to Indra. You can help these sorrowstricken devatas. \"O Sinless Lord, Be born son to Aditi and to me, O Destroyer of asuras, be the younger brother to Indra. You can help these sorrowstricken devatas. O Lord of the celestials, with my penance accomplished (here) this place will be known as siddhaashrama by your grace. O Lord arise from here\". Then the resplendent Visnu, born from the womb of Aditi and assuming the form of Vamana, approached, the son of Virochana (Bali). Thereafter, Visnu, soul of the universe who restores respect (for the righeous), and renders the welfare of all living beings, having begged from Bali, and been granted three places to put his footsteps on occupied the (three) worlds and by restraining Bali with Visnu's energy, gave (it) back to Mahendra. In this manner the highly lustrous Visnu, gave  possession of the three worlds to Mahendra. Thereafter, Visnu, soul of the universe who restores respect (for the righeous), and renders the welfare of all living beings, having begged from Bali, and been granted three places to put his footsteps on occupied the (three) worlds and by restraining Bali with Visnu's energy, gave (it) back to Mahendra. In this manner the highly lustrous Visnu, gave  possession of the three worlds to Mahendra. \"This asrama, which relieves fatigue, previously under the possession of Vamana, has come under my occoupation for my devotion to Vamana. \"O tiger among men, wicked rakshasas who prowl about the asram and cause obstacles ought to be killed here only. \"O Rama, now let's go to the unparalleled Siddhashrama. O child this asrama is the same to you as it is to me (treat this as your own)\". While enetering the hermitage the great ascetic appeared resplendent (in the company of Rama and Lakshmana) like the moon in conjunction with Punarvasu star emerging out of  the mist. At the sight of Viswamitra all the ascetics, inmates of Siddhashrama, jumped out instantly and offered Viswamitra their worship. They extended hospitality to both the princes in the same way they offered their worship to the sagacious Viswamitra. The two princes of the lineage of Raghu, destroyers of foes rested a while and then said to Viswamitra, a tiger amon sages: O foremost of ascetics Get initialed today. You will prosper and this asram will attain its fulfilment. Your words shall come true. Saying this, Viswamitra, the great saint effulgent and self trained engaged himself in the  initiation ceremony. The two princes spent the right comfortably and woke up at daybreak. They  performed morning in accordance with the prescribed rule, ablutions, said their prayers and paid their respects to Viswamitra seated at the kindled firesacrifice.      : Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus spoke the two princes to Viswamitra. They were conscious of place and time to speak and capable of conquering enemies. \"O adorable Brahmarshi, we want to know around what time the rakshasas will make their appearance so that the sacrifice can be protected. Let  not that moment pass\". The sages (of the asrama) were very pleased. They extolled the princes of Kakustha dynasty, who were eager to fight the rakshasas. \"O sons of Raghu's lineage protect the sacrifice for six nights from today. With the ceremoney initiated, the sage would  observe silence said the inmates\". At these words of the sages the illustrious princes got ready to protect the tapovana for six days and six nights without sleep. The two mighty, heroic archers (Rama and Lakshmana), destroyers of enemies attended upon the sacrifice in order to protect sage Viswamitra. Time passed. When the sixth day arrived Rama cautioned Lakshmana to be vigilant. While Rama was fracing up for a fight, the fire on the sacrificial altar with the officiating priests and spiritual guides suddenly brightened. The altar with Viswamitra and the officiating priests, kusa grass, ladles and square vessels, bundles of sticks and  flowers, (used in the sacrificfial fire) got brightened up. While the sacrifice was being performed in accordance with mantras, a great sound causing fear emerged from the sky. Like the clouds in the rainy season, the two rakshasas (Maricha and Subahu), covering the sky through their power of illusion, came running (to the sacrificial place). Maricha and Subahu of fearful appearance arrived with their followers and rained streams of blood (on the sacrificial altar). Flames rose on the sacrificial altar drenched by the stream of blood. Immediately Rama rushed forward and beheld them in the sky. Having seen them (Maricha and Subahu) suddenly advancing the lotuseyed Rama gazed at Lakshmana and said: \"O Lakshmana, behold, by Manavaastra Rama shall chase, like clouds scattered by winds those wicked rakshasas who eat human flesh\". The inflamed Rama hurled the highly powerful and effulgent Manavaastra on the chest of Maricha. Smitten by that powerful Manavaastra, Maricha was thrown to a full distance of hundred yojanas into the surging high seas. Having seen Maricha beaten by the power of that coolarrowed astra, thrown to a distance, reeling and lying unconscious, Rama spoke to Lakshmana: \"O Lakshmana behold this Manavaastra associated with righteousness employing a cool arrow, which carries him away by making him unconscious and yet not taking his life. \"Rama shall slay these merciless, wicked, doers of sinful acts, destroyers of sacrifices and blood-thirsty rakshasas \". Then Rama took hold of the celestial, marvellous Agneya weapon and hurled it into the chest of Subahu. Struck, Subahuhe fell down on the ground. Illustrious and highly generous Rama killed the  remaining rakshasas  with the Vayavya weapon to the delight of the ascetics. Having killed the rakshasas, obstructors of sacrifices, Rama was worshipped by the hermits like Indra was honoured in the past when he was victorious. Thereafter, when the sacrifice was completed, maharshi Viswamitra beholding all the directions  bereft of evils, said to Rama:",
                "There, with their purpose fulfilled the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, full of joy in their hearts spent the night. As the night dawned, both the brothers performed the morning rites and approached Viswamitra and other rishis. Sweettongued, they visited with folded hands the best of ascetics Viswamitra who was shining like a flaming fire and addressed Viswamitra thus in sweet and generous words: \"O tiger among ascetics, we two are at your service. Command whatever you want and we shall execute\" it. Addressed, thus by both of them, Viswamitra ahead of all the sages, spoke to Rama. \"O foremost of men, Janaka, king of Mithila, is performing a great religious sacrifice. We shall go there. O tiger among men, come along with us. You ought to see there the wonderful jewel of a bow. O best among men, this bow of immeasurable energy. dreadful and highly lustrous was bestowed on king Janaka by devatas in a sacrificial assembly in the past. Neither devas, nor gandharvas, nor asuras nor human, are capable of stringing the bow by any means. Mighty princes and kings have failed to string it, in their attempt to know its strength. O best of men, O descendent of Kakustha, there you will see the bow that belongs to the magnanimous king of Mithila and the wonderful sacrifice at that place. O best among men, that excellent bow strong in the middle was offered by king of Mithila, Devarata as well as by all devatas as fruit of the sacrifice. O Rama, that bow is worshipped in the king's palace as principal deity with various kinds of perfumes, sandal paste, incense and fragrant agaru\". Having spoken thus, Viswamitra, the best of ascetics commenced the onward journey along with the Kakutshas and rishis, taking leave of the deities of the forest. \"(O ascetics of the forest) May you be safe. My purpose has been achieved in this Siddhaashrama. From here I shall go to the Himavanta mountain situated on the northern bank of Jahnavi\" (said Viswamitra). Thereafter, circumambulating the supreme Siddhasrama with reverence, they (Viswamitra and the princes) commenced their journey in the northern direction. As Viswamitra, the best of ascetics set out on his journey, expounders of the Vedas followed Viswamitra, nearly in one hundred carriages. Birds and beasts living in Siddhaashrama also followed the illustrious maharshi Viswamitra over a long distance until Viswamitra sent them back. The sages travelled a long distance and halted on the bank of Sona at sunset. The sages who possessed great splendour bathed and offered oblations to fire at sunset and sat in front of Viswamitra. Rama together with Lakshmana having offered respectful salutations to the sages, sat in front of the sagacious Viswamitra. Thereafter highly lustrous Rama, the best among men, filled with curiosity enquired of the great sage Viswamitra: \"O worshipful one, what could be the reason for this region shining with luxuriant groves? I wish to hear from Viswamitra. Viswamitra can tell me all about this (region). May it be safe for Viswamitra\" A sage of excellent vows and rigid austerities, Viswamitra, urged by the words of Rama, described in the midst of rishis the entire story relating to that region. : Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "There was a great ascetic named Kusa, born to Brahma, as ascetic indefatigable in vows, knowldegeable in dharma and a respector of the virtuous. That great soul, Kusa, married the princess of Vidarbha  born in a noble family and a match for Kusa. Kusa begot four virtuous sons who resembled Kusa. They were Kusamba, Kusanabha, Adhurtarajas and Vasu. Kusa addressed his four brilliant sons who were highly enthusiastic, pious, truthful and were wedded to duties of the warrior race: \"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes. \"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes. The brilliant Kushamba and the righteous Kushanabha constructed the cities of Kaushanbi and Mahodaya (as their capital) respectively. O Rama king Adhurtarajasa constructed Dharmaranya, the best of cities and king Vasu, the city of Girivrajam. O Rama this place where we are (called Vasumati) belongs to the magnanimous king Vasu. This is  surrounded by five great shining mountains. The delightful and renowned river Sumagadhi (known as Sona), flowing in the country of Magadha, looks beautiful like a garland amidst five great mountains. Rama, this Magadhi river, of great Vasu flows from the east surrounded by fertile crops fields like a garland. O scion of the Raghu family, the virtuous rajarshi Kusanabha begot one hundred beautiful daughters through a nymph named Ghritachi. Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight. Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight. With beautiful limbs of unparalleled beauty on earth, they shone in the pleasuregarden like stars in the midst of clouds. At the sight of the maidens embellished with all virtues and youth and beauty, the allpervading Windgod addressed them these words: I request you all to be my wives. You will leave this feeling of mortality and attain a long life. Youth is always unstable, especially in human beings. If you marry me, you will be ever youthful like devatas. At the works of the untiringly blowing Windgod the lunged maidens laughed and said: \"O best among devatas you move within all living beings, we feel your impact. Why do you insult us? \"O best among devatas we are daughters of Kusanabha, We are capable of pulling you down from your position. We are safeguarding our ascetic merit as virgins (we could curse you to save our ascetic merit)\" of Kusnabha. O wicked one, do not dishonour our father who always speaks the truth. He will choose the bridegrooms righteously. Do not invite death (father may be the cause of your death). Our father is our lord. Our father is god to us. Whomsoever our father offers us shall become our husband\". Having heard the words of those maidens, the most powerful and venerable Windgod became furious. He entered all the limbs of their bodies, twisted and distorted them. Their bodies disfigured and shattered by the Windgod, the maidens with tears flowing from their eyes entered the palace and fell down on the ground, agitated and of Kusanabha. The king saw his extremely beautiful beloved daughters distressed and shattered and spoke these words with bewilderment. \"O daughters What has happened? Who has dishonoured virtue? Say it at once. Who has made you hunchbacked? Standing roud me, why are you dumb?\" The king heaved a sigh and entered into a state of samadhi.      : Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "On hearing the words of sagacious Kusanabha, his hundred daughters touched Kusanabha's feet with their heads and said: \"O king, the allpervading Windgod, having taken recourse to foul means intended to outrage our modesty without and moral compunction. We have our father Kusanabha who is dear to us. Hence we do not have freedom to choose. You may ask our father Kusanabha if Kusanabha is willing to give us (in marriage). As all of us were speaking thus, the sinful Windgod, disregarding our words repeatedly assaulted us. The deeply religious and highly powerful king Kusanabha, having heard those words of his one hundred exceptional daughters, replied: \"O daughters you have done a great act of forgiveness of which only the tolerant are capable. By taking a united stand, you have protected the honour of my dynasty. Whether for women or men forgiveness is an ornament. It is difficult even for gods. For you, daughters, to show it without any difference of opinion is especially hard. \"Forbearance is charity, forbearance is sacrifice, forbearance is truth, forbearance is glory and forbearance is virtue. O daughters, the universe is supported by forbearance\". \"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king Kusanabha endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place. \"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king Kusanabha endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place. At that time a great and virtuous ascetic named Chuli living in celebacy was performing austerities in pursuit of the knowledge of Brahman. When Chuli was performing austerities, a nymph named Somada, daughter of Urmila, used to serve Chuli. Prosperity to Somada Somada rendered Somada's services with devotion and humility. There Somada lived a religious life. In the might time her spiritual guide was satisfied with Somada's services. When Somada's services came to a fruition with the passage of time, maharshi Chuli, spoke to Somada: 'I am pleased with you. What favour shall I do for you? May you be prosperous' Having perceived that the sage was satisfied, the gandharva Somada who was skilled in speech said exceedingly delighted to the sage in a sweet voice. Bestowed with the great asceticism and brilliance of a brahmin, you look like Brahma. O righteous one, I desire a son endowed with the ascetic virtues of a brahmin. I am without a husband, my sire. I am not a wife to any one. Since I have taken refuge in you, you are competent to bestow on me a son with the power of your penance\". Pleased with Somada, brahmarshi Chuli gave Somada an excellent son to be wellknown as Brahmadatta born through the will of Chuli's mind. Then king Brahmadatta, son of Somada, lived in the city of Kampilya with great prosperity like Indra in heaven. O Rama, then the highly righteous king Kusanabha decided to give his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta\". The lord of the earth, highly powerful king Kusanabha invited Brahmadatta, and gave his hundred daughters in marriage to Brahmadatta with a heart highly pleased. O son of Raghu's dynasty that king Brahmadatta resembling Indra received the hands of those maidens' in due order. Thereafter, with the mere touch of Brahmadatta's hand, the hundred daughters were cured of their hump back and freed from anguish. They assumed great beauty. King Kusanabha, having seen his daughters released from disfigurement caused by the Windgod was immensely pleased. Kusanabha experienced waves of delight. Then the king Kusanabha along with his queens performed the marriage of his daughters in the assembly of priests and sent them with Brahmadatta (to his kingdom). Somada the gandharvi was exeedingly delighted with her daughtersinlaw and praised Brahmadatta for Brahmadatta's right action. : Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O son of Raghu's dynasty (Rama) Brahmadatta got married and left for his kingdom. Now a putreshti was performed by king Kusanabha in order to beget a son. Then, while putreshti was on Kusa the highly generous son of Brahma, said to king Kusanabha : \"O son, a highly virtuous son named Gadhi, similar to you will be born. Because of him you will obtain everlasting fame throughtout this world\". \"O Rama so saying to king Kusanabha, Kusa left through space for the eternal   Brahmaloka\". After some time, a supremely righteous son by name Gadhi was born to the sagacious Kusanabha. O son of Raghu's dynasty the highly virtuous Gadhi is my father. I am known as Kausika being born in the family of Kusa. O Raghava adherent of best religious practices, is my elder sister well known by name Satyavati. Satyavati was bestowed in marriage to Richika. Following Richika Satyavati reached heaven with Satyavati's human body and down assuming the form of a sacred river, flowed Kausiki. Conferring the benefit of the other world and worldly pleasures on men Satyavati who is divine and beautiful having sacred waters took resort in Himavat mountain and started flowing from there. O son of the Raghus', from then onwards with affection towards Satyavati Kausiki, I am  living happily in the vicinity of Himavat mountains. Satyavati is sacred, firmly established in truth and righteousness. Satyavati is chaste holy and best among rivers. Satyavati is known as river Kausiki. Rama, for the sake of  observance of austerity Kausika have come to Siddhaashrama leaving Satyavati behind. Having reached here, Kausika have fulfilled Kausika's desire through Rama's valour. O mightyarmed Rama since Rama asked Kausika, Kausika narrated this, Kausika's origin, the history of Kausika's family and the history of this place. O son of the Kakusthas while telling Kausika's stories, midnight has passed by. Go to sleep now. Prosperity to Rama. Let there be no obstacles on Rama's way. O son of the Raghus' the trees stand motionless, with the beasts and birds calm, all directions are pervaded with darkness. Evening has gradually disappeared. The sky is littered with stars and planets gleaming points of light as though they are the eyes of the skies. O Lord the Moon with his cool rays, dispelling the darkness of the earth and delighting the minds of all living beings in this world, is rising higher and higher. All nocturnal creatures groups of yakshas and rakshasas and dreadful eaters of human flesh are moving here and there\". Having spoken thus the highly lustrous, great ascetic rested. All sages praised Viswamitra, saying, \"wellsaid wellsaid\" This is the family of the Kusas, venerable always devoted to dharma, foremost of men, great like Lord Brahma. \"Highly illustrious Viswamitra, Viswamitra is similar to Brahma. Among the rivers, Kausiki is the best, refurbishing the image of Viswamitra's dynasty\". In this way, adored by the best of ascetics, the auspicious son of Kusika, went to sleep like the lustrous Sun setting. Rama as well as Lakshmana, with a sense of wonder went to sleep full of admiration for the great ascetic.      : Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

It is time for morning rituals. Arise, arise May the day bring good news Get ready for the onward journey\". On hearing Viswamitra's words Rama performed morning oblations and getting ready for the onward journey spoke: \"O knower of Brahman Clean waters of this river are adorned with sandbanks. This Sona is deep. Which way shall we cross this river? Having been addressed by Rama thus Viswamitra said, \"We shall take the way the ascetics have gone before\". With these words of the wise Viswamitra the ascetics moved forward surveying various forests. After travelling a long distance for half a day, they saw Jahnavi, the best among rivers  haunted or worshipped by ascetics. On seeing the river Ganga with swans and cranes floating on the surface of the  sacred waters, all the sages including Rama and Lakshmana were delighted. The birds had made the bank of the river their home. Rama and Lakshmana took a dip and offered traditional oblations to ancestors. Thereafter Rama and Lakshmana lighted the sacrificial fire and made customary offerings to the fire and partook of the nectarlike remains.

Himavan is the king of mountains. Himavan had two daughters, unrivalled in beauty in this world. O Rama Himavan's beloved of beautiful waist, wellknown by the name of Manorama is the daughter of Mount Meru. Manorama is the mother to both the daughters. O son of the Raghus this Ganga was born to Manorama as Himavan's eldest daughter. A second one  born to Himavan was wellknown by the name of Uma. Thereupon all the devatas desirous of deriving some advantage proposed that the eldest daughter of the king of mountains, Ganga, flowing in three directions be given to them. In order to do good to the three worlds Himavan, rooted in dharma gifted his eldest daughter Ganga who sanctifies the whole world by flowing at her free will The devatas having received Ganga committed to the welfare of the three worlds went back to their abodes with a sense of fulfilment in their mind. O Delight of the Raghus The other daughter of the mountain Himavan was a maiden whose wealth was tapas. Uma pursued a vow and observed severe austerities. Himavan the best of mountains gave his daughter Uma associated with severe austerities and venerated by the whole world in marriage to the unrivalled  Rudra. O son of the Raghus Ganga, the holiest of rivers and Uma devi  are two daughters of the king of the mountains, (Himavan). They are worshipped by the entire world.

Thus replied by the devatas, the god of the gods released his vital fluid on earth. It pervaded the entire earth including mountains and forests. Then, the devatas said to the firegod, \"Enter this energy (creative power) related to Rudra followed by the windgod\". That energy pervaded by fire was transformed into the White Mountain. It turned the forest of reeds (Saravana) (blazing) like the fire or the Sun. From that fire was born the glorious Kartikeya.

He is engrossed in great penance along with Uma . \"O Knower of law and order O Grandsire verily you are our supreme refuge committed to the welfare of the worlds. Tell us what we should do in this matter (now that we cannot procreate a general on account of Uma's curse)\".

Through Ganga the Firegod will beget a son who will be capable of destroying enemies. He will become the army general of the gods\". \"Ganga, the eldest daughter of the king of the mountains, will tend that son of Agni. This will be totally acceptable to Uma.

Ganga addressing the Firegod standing ahead of all the devatas said 'O god of fire, I am incapable of holding your everincreasing splendour. The fiery fluid is burning me. My consciousness is overwhelmed'. Thereafter the Firegod who is the partaker of oblations offered to all deities said to Ganga 'Place this embryo on this slope of Mountain Himavan'. \"O glorious, sinless one, (Rama) hearing the words of the Firegod, Ganga then expelled that resplendent embryo from Ganga's streams.

Those krittikas, having decided among themselves and having made an agreement with the gods saying 'This boy shall become a son to all of us' fed Kumara with the krittikas' milk (breast milk). Thereafter, all the gods said, 'This son shall become renowned in the three worlds as Karttikeya, (son of krittikas). There is no doubt '. Hearing the words of the gods, the krittikas bathed the baby that descended from the womb of Ganga resembling flaming fire and shining with great beauty. O scion of the Kakusthas, Karttikeya lustrous like flaming fire, was very fortunate Descended from the womb of the Ganga, Karttikeya is named Skanda by the gods. Then excellent milk surged in the breasts of krittikas. Assuming six mouths, Karttikeya sucked the milk. Drinking milk just for a day and with a body still tender Karttikeya could vanquish hosts of demons by Karttikeya's inborn prowess so capable be was With the Firegod in the forefront, all the gods assembled and installed Karttikeya, shining on unsurpassed brilliant, as commander of the gods forces. \"O Rama this story of Ganga and that of the birth of Kumara, who was fortunate and auspicious, has been related to you in detail. O son of the Kakusthas whosoever reveres Karttikeya on this earth with devotion and faith, shall have a long life, sons and grandsons and after death will reach the world of Skanda\".      : Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Viswamitra, an offspring of Kusika having related the story (of Karthikeya) to the son of the Kakusthas (Rama) said again. \"In olden days there lived a brave and righteous king named Sagara who was ruler of Ayodhya. Sagara was childless and desired to have children, O Rama the daughter of the king of Vidarbha by name Kesini was Sagara's eldest wife who was righteous and truthful. The daughter of Arishtanemi named Sumati was the second wife of Sagara and  none surpassed Sumati in charm on earth. The king (Sagara) accompanied by Kesini and Sumati reached Himavat mountain and engaged himself in severe austerities on a peak called Bhriguprasravana. When Sagara completed a hundred years in austerities, highly pleased by Sagara's performance, ascetic Bhrugu, the best among the truthful granted Sagara a boon. O sinless one, you will get a very great progeny, O best among men you will acquire unparalleled fame in this world. O child, one wife will beget a son who will perpetuate your race and the other, sixty thousand sons, said Bhrugu. Thereafter, Kesini and Sumati were exceedingly delighted. Having propitiated that magnanimous asectic both of them with folded hands in supplication, said: O knower of Brahman which of us will beget one, and who many sons? O Brahmarshi we wish to hear. Let your words come true\". Hearing Kesini and Sumati's words, highly virtuous Bhrugu made an excellent statement saying, 'In this matter, you may exercise your free will'. 'What would you wish? One son who perpetuates the race or many possessed of mighty strength endowed with fame and perseverance?' (asked Bhrugu). \"O Rama, delight of the descendants of Raghus, on hearing the words of the ascetic in the presence of king Sagara, Kesini chose the boon to have a son who perpetuates the race. Then, Sumati (the other wife) sister of Suparna (Garuda) obtained the boon of sixty thousand sons endowed with fame and great perseverance. O son of the Raghus the king along with Kesini and Sumati, having circumambulated saint Bhrugu, bowed Sagara's head in reverence, saluted Bhrugu with folded hands and returned to Sagara's capital. After lapse of some time, the eldest wife Kesini gave birth to a son wellknown by name Asamanjasa. O best among men, Sumati gave birth to a gourdlike foetus and when it burst open, sixty thousand sons emerged. Nurses placed all of the sixty thousand sons in pots filled with clarified butter and fostered them. They attained adolescence after a long time. Then, after a long time Sagara's sixty thousand sons attained beauty and youth. O best among men, delight of the Raghus (in the mean time) sagara's eldest son  Asamanjasa, used to seize hold of children and throw them into the waters of river Sarayu. And while they were drowning, Asamanjasa was laughing. Thus this son inclined towards evil and formenting the good citizens was banished (of the king) from the capital for Asamanjasa's indulgence in malevolent acts. Asamanjasa's son was Anshuman. Anshuman was valiant, beloved and courteous to every one in the world. O best among men after a long time, a thought came to the mind of Sagara to definitely perform a sacrifice. O Rama having determined to perform a sacrifice, he (Sagara) versed in the Vedas, started the initiatory rites for the sacrifice in the company of high priests\".      : 2 Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

Prosperity to you\". Viswamitra addressing the son of the Kakusthas (Rama) with a smile said, \"O Rama hear in detail the story of the magnanimous king Sagara\". \"Sankara's fatherinlaw named Himavan is the greatest mountain. Himavan and Vindhya came close and began looking at one another. (because both are of extreme height and in between them there was no obstruction). \"O best of men, the sacrifice took place in the region in between these two  mountains. O tiger among men the region was appropriate for conducting sacrificial acts. \"O child, O son of the Kakutsthas, the great charioteer Anshuman (who can fight with eleven thousand charioteers), wielding a strong bow  followed the  sacrificial horse (in order to protect it) in compliance with Sagara's wish. On the concluding day of the fortnight (full moon day) while the sacrifice was being performed, Vasava (Indra) assuming the form of rakshasa, had stolen away Sagara's sacrificial horse. O son of the Kakutsthas, when the magnanimous king Sagara's sacrificial horse was stolen away, all the high priests addressing the performer of the sacrifice said: 'O Kakutstha on this auspicious (fullmoon) day the sacrificial horse has been stolen away suddenly and forcibly. Slay the thief and bring back the horse'. 'This flaw in sacrifice will be inauspicious for all of us. Hence O king do everything which will ensure flawlessness to this sacrifice'. Having heard the words of the officiating priests, the king (Sagara) addressed his sixty thousand sons in the sacrificial assembly, saying: 'O Best among men, O sons of Sagara I do not the hand of rakshasas in this as this great sacrifice is consecrated by mantras (to prevent any interruption) and is presided over by eminent priests. 'Therefore my sons of Sagara, go and search this entire earth surrounded by oceans. May you be safe'.

O Son of the Raghus (Rama) dreadful sounds emanated while the earth was being broken open by  ploughs and lances similar to thunderbolt. O descendant of Raghu when the earth was being churned, an irrepressible sound of serpents, demons and rakshasas --of all creatures emerged. O Descendant of the Raghus the heroic sons of Sagara excavated sixty thousand yojanas of earth reaching the nether world (one of the several regions below the earth). O Foremost among men (Rama) the princes while thus excavating Jambu dweepa,  in this way filled with mountains, moved around everywhere. Then the gods together with the gandharvas, asuras and serpents in bewildered minds approached Lord Brahma. With highly agitated minds and meloncholic faces, all of them approached magnanimous Brahma and having propitiated him said: O Venerable one the entire earth is being excavated by the sons of Sagara.

Possessed of great strength, they beheld also in the western quarter a great elephant of the quarter named Saumanasa resembling a mountain. Having paid homage and enquiring as to his wellbeing, they arrived at the northern region by digging the earth. O Rama in the northern region, they beheld an auspicious elephant named Bhadra, who was white like snow, was holding that quater. Then all sixty thousand sons having touched the elephant Bhadra and circumambulated it, penetrated the earth. Subsequently, the sons of Sagara, having gone towards the celebrated northeastern region began to dig with wrath. Great sons of Sagara terribly swiftfooted and exceedingly powerful beheld the eternal Visnu in (sage) Kapila and not far away from him the horse grazing.

You have acquired knowledge (in various fields). You are illustrious like your ancestors. Pursue the track taken by your uncles and by the thief who ran away with the horse'. 'Creatures in the depths of the earth are powerful and mighty. Carry with you a bow and weapons to counter their attack'. 'Honour those who deserve it. Kill those who cause obstacles to sacrifice. Come back with your mission accomplishing. And ensure the (successful) completion of my sacrifice'. \"Having been throughly instructed by the highsouled Sagara in this way, Anshuman left with rapid strides carrying a scimitar and a bow. O Best among men directed by the king (Sagara), Anshuman followed the path taken by his noble uncles into the depths of the earth. Exceedingly valiant Ashuman beheld the elephant of the quarter worshipped by daityas, danavas, rakshasas, pisachas, birds and serpents. Having circumambulated the elephant, Anshuman enquired about his wellbeing, the where abouts of his uncles and also about the one who had stolen the sacrificial horse. Having listened to the words of Anshuman the elephant of the quarter replied, 'O Anshuman, son of Asamanjasa having fulfilled your objective, you will go back soon with the horse'. Having listened to the words of the elephant, Anshuman started enquring the well being of each of the guardians (elephants) of the quarters successively with due respect: All those elephants of the quarters were knowers of the essence of words and proficient in the right use of words. Treating Anshuman kindly the elephants encouraged him saying, 'You will go back with the horse'. Hearing their words with a quick pace where Anshuman reached the place his uncles, sons of Sagara were reduced to heaps of ashes. Then the son of Asamanjasa, overwhelmed with sorrow and deeply distressed at their destruction, bewailed with great grief. Possessed by grief and tears, Anshuman, that tiger among men, beheld the sacrificial horse grazing nearby. With the intention of performing traditional funeral rites with water for the deceased princes, highly lustrous Anshuman looked around for water but could not see any reservoir of water (in the neighbourhood). O Rama with his keen eyes, Anshuman marked Suparna, the maternal uncle of his uncles, lord of the eagles (Garuda) bestowed with the swiftness of the wind. Highly powerful Garuda, son of Vinata, addressing Anshuman said 'O Tiger among men do not grieve. This act of assasination is meant for the welfare of the three worlds'. 'Your valiant uncles have been burnt by Kapila of boundless power. O Sagcious one performing traditional rites with ordinary water is not proper'. 'O Best among men O Mightyarmed one perform the traditional rites of your uncles with water from river Ganga, the eldest daughter of Himavat'. Ganga, the purifier of the three worlds, will sanctify your uncles reduced to heaps of ashes. These heaps when inundated by waters of Ganga, beloved of the worlds, will take all the sixty thousand sons to heaven. 'O Highly fortunate one O Best among men go back with that horse. O Hero It behoves of you to complete the sacrifice undertaken by your grandfather'. Exceedingly powerful and highly renowned Anshuman, on hearing the words of Garuda returned quickly to the capital with the horse O Descendant of the Raghus (Rama), having reached the king who had been initiated into the ceremony, Anshuman communicated faithfully to him all that had happened. He also reported the words Suparna had said. The king heard (was stunned to hear) the awful words of Anshuman, (yet) he performed the sacrifice in accordance with traditional scriptures and Kalpa, the Vedanga. The great lord of the earth (king Sagara) after performing the sacrifice reached his capital. (But) He could not devise any means to bring Ganga down to the earth.

Anshuman had a great son, Dilipa who became famous. O Delight of the Raghus having vested the kingdom with Dilipa, Anshuman performed rigid penance on the sacred peak of the Himavat mountain. O Rama highly renowned Anshuman, having lived for thirtytwo thousand years in the tapovana, turned an ascetic and attained heaven (without accomplishing his objective). When exceedingly brilliant Dilipa heard about the death of Anshuman's grandfathers, Dilipa was overtaken by grief but could not arrive at any conclusion with Dilipa's intellect (regarding means of bringing down the sacred river). How to bring about the descent of Ganga? How to perform funeral rites of the ancestors with Ganga water? How to liberate them Thus Dilipa was constantly engaged in such thoughts. As Dilipa known for Dilipa's knowledge of the soul constantly reflected righteously on (this matter of Ganga), a highly virtuous son named Bhagiratha was born to Dilipa. Most brilliant king Dilipa ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years performing many sacrifices. O Tiger among men king Dilipa was unable to arrive at a conclusion regarding the salvation of the ancestors of Dilipa. Dilipa was affected by illness and died. The king Dilipa performed the coronation of Bhagiratha and reached the region of Indra as a reward for virtuous acts done by Dilipa. O delight of the Raghus righteous Bhagiratha who was highly lustrous rajarshi was without sons. Bhagiratha was desirous of progeny but did not beget children. O son of the Raghus (Rama), Bhagiratha, with a determination to bring down Ganga entrusted the kingdom to Bhagiratha's ministers and went to a sacred place known as Gokarna. There with arms uplifted surrounded by four fires, partaking food once a month, with Bhagiratha's senses controlled, carried out panchatapa for a number of years.

Brilliant, glorious Bhagiratha, stood before the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded palms and spoke\": 'O Lord if you are pleased with Bhagiratha's austerities and if Bhagiratha's austerities are worthy of a reward, grant Bhagiratha the boon whereby all the sons of Sagara will receive from Bhagiratha funeral rites with the waters (of Ganga)'.

I will hold Ganga on my head, the daughter of the king of mountains (to reduce  the force of her descent). I shall do your wish.

With all Ganga's efforts Ganga could not reach the earth. There the golden Ganga wandered about for many years. Bhagiratha not finding Ganga, once again resorted to great penance.

It appeared as though the sky was filled with a hundred Suns. The sky strewn with lightnings appeared as if it was inhabited by seaanimals, serpents and fishes fickle. White foams of water were scattered in a thousand ways. It appeared as if the sky was  spread over with autumnal clouds flocks of swans. Ganga was flowing now rapid, now slow, now wide, now meandering, now low, now high. Sometimes waves dashed against waves. They rose repeatedly upwards and fell down on the ground. The waters of Ganga descended on Shankara's head and from there to the earth. Freed from all impurities, the waters looked pure and clean. Considering the waters fallen from the head of Siva sacred, devatas, rishis and gandharvas and those living on earth touched Ganga (with reverence). Those cursed to fall from heaven to earth were absolved of their sins after bathing there (in the waters of Ganga). Cleansed of their sins by the sparkling waters, they ascended through the sky once again to their own (celestial) worlds. People rejoiced at the sight of those shining waters. They were happy  to have a dip in Ganga and their fatigue was gone. Most brilliant rajarshi Bhagiratha also mounting the divine chariot moved forward and Ganga followed Bhagiratha.

Could Viswamitra tell Rama? Great is Rama's curiosity. May Viswamitra prosper\" Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, hearing the words of Rama commenced to relate the history of the ancient city of Vishala. \"O Rama hear the auspicious legend of Indra. Listen, too, what had happened to this country. O Blessed Rama in kritayuga, the sons of Diti were very strong and those of Aditi were spirited and righteous. O Best among men a thought came to those illustrious ones, 'how can we be free from old age, death and disease'? \"O Rama While the noble sons were reflecting over this matter an idea flashed across their minds to get nectar by churning the ocean of milk. Thereupon, having decided to churn (the ocean mind) those very powerful ones, made Vasuki, (the great snake), as a rope and Mandara mountain as the churning rod.And started churning it. After a thousand years, the hoods of the snake made as rope vomitted venom and started biting the rocks of the Mandara mountain with their teeth. Therefrom was produced halahala, virulent venom resembling fire.The entire universe consisting of devatas, asuras and mortals was burnt down. The devatas sought refuge in the great god Rudra who causes happiness, the Lord of all living beings. 'Save us, Save us', the cried. Thereupon, Hari the Lord of celestial beings extolled by the devatas appeared bearing the conch and discus. Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra \"O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom.\" Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra \"O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom.\" Visnu, the highest among the devatas having the spoken, vanished. Siva who had heard Visnu's words and seen the fear of the gods received that dreadful halahala treating it as nectar. Lord of the gods, venerable Siva went away to his abode leaving behind the devatas. O Descendant of Raghu then all the devatas and asuras resumed churning. 'O Sinless one after the mountain (Mandara) used as churning rod sank down to nether world (patala) the devatas along with the gandharvas invoked Visnu'. \"O mightyarmed Visnu you are the ultimate refuge for all living beings, specially for the devatas. Protect us, you (alone) are fit to lift up the Mandara mountain\". Having heard these words, the controller of the sense organs, Visnu, assumed the form of a tortoise reclined in the ocean supporting the mountain on its back. Visnu, the Supreme being, the soul of the universe standing amidst the devatas took hold of the peak of mountain with his hand and continued to churn the ocean. In this way thousand years rolled by. In the beginining came out Dhanvantari holding a staff and a water pot (carried by ascetics) and apsaras of high lustre. O Best among men excellent women emerged out of the essence produced by churning of waters. Therefore they are known as apsarasas. O Kakutstha there appeared sixty crore highly lustrous apsarasas. Their attendants were countless in number. Neither devas nor danavas accept them in marriage. Unmarried, all of them have been regarded as belonging to all. O Joy of the Raghus (Rama) thereafter Varuna's daughter Varuni (goddess of wine) came out searching for a consort. O Rama while Diti's sons did not accept the unblemished Varuni, O heroic one, the sons of Aditi did. For that reason, sons of Diti were called asuras. Aditi's sons were known as suras. Devatas grew exceedingly glad for having Varuni. O Foremost among men (Rama) ucchaishravas, the best of horses (the celestial horse), kausthubham, the best jewel and also nectar came (from churning). O Rama the race of devatas and daityas suffered great destruction because of (their fight for) that nectar. Thereafter Aditi's sons, the devatas killed Diti's sons, the daityas. O Heroic Rama all the asuras along with the rakshasas joined on one side. A violent and a dreadful battle which threw the three worlds in to a great confusion, ensued. When everything was destroyed completely, the exceedingly powerful Visnu assuming the form of Mohini a charming woman (elusive form) with the power of illusion quickly stole away the nectar. Those who opposed the imperishable, supreme purusha, Visnu, in the battle were crushed by all powerful Visnu. In that great and terrible battle between daityas and devatas, Aditi's sons killed Diti's. Indra, having killed the sons of Diti was happy with the kingdom gained. Indra ruled the worlds in the company of rishis and celestial singers\". : Thus ends the fortyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Rama! afflicted with great grief when Diti's sons were killed, Diti said to Diti's husband Kasyapa, son of Maricha: \"O adorable one, Kasyapa's highly powerful sons, (devatas) have killed Diti's sons through extensive austerities. Diti am desirous of obtaining a (mighty) son capable of killing Indra. Diti shall practise austerities. Kasyapa ought to grant Diti a son who would be the supreme ruler of the world and capable of killing Indra. Kasyapa can say yes (if Kasyapa will)\". Then, Maricha's son, exceedingly bright Kasyapa on hearing the words of Diti who was deeply grieved replied: \"O one vested with the wealth of austerities be it so. Prosperity to Diti Remain chaste, Diti will deliver a son who will kill Indra in the battle. \"If Diti remain pure and clean, on completion of a thousand years Diti will give birth to a son through Kasyapa who will be the lord of the three worlds\". Highly brilliant Kasyapa, having thus spoken, touched Diti gently with Kasyapa's palm, stroked Diti's body and said, \"May good betide thee\". Having said this, Kasyapa went away to perform austerities. \"O foremost among men after Kasyapa had left, Diti exceedingly delighted (at the prospect of having sons) reached Kushaplavana, and practised intense mortifications. O foremost of men great treasure of virtues while Diti was practising austerities, the thousandeyed Indra began to serve Diti. The thousandeyed Indra served Diti by providing fire, Kusha grass, sticks for burning, water, fruits, roots and all other things desired by Diti. Indra attended on Diti, stroking Diti's limbs gently from time to time to help Diti regain their suppleness and alleviate Diti's fatigue. O son of the Raghus ten years before completion of a thousand years. Diti, highly pleased with the services rendered by Indra, addressed Indra\", saying: \"O best of the gods Indra's illustrious father granted Diti a boon for a son Diti sought on completion of a thousand years (of penance). O the best of the brave ten years is yet to go (for completion of austerities). Indra will have a brother. May Indra prosper O Child Diti will create in Indra eagerness victory. Together with Indra, Indra will gain victory over the three worlds. Relieved of sorrows, enjoy you'll with Indra\". After speaking thus to Indra, goddess Diti overpowered with sleep around midsday dropped off, Diti's feet towards Diti's head. Indra laughed. Indra rejoiced at the sight of Diti's ominous posture of sleeping with Diti's feet towards Diti's head and Diti's hair falling on Diti's feet. O Rama with great courage Indra entered Diti's womb and severed Diti's embryo into seven pieces. O Rama that embryo, being severed by Vajra having a hundred edges, cried at high pitch which awakened Diti\". Highly powerful Indra, even while saying to the crying embryo \"Do not weep, Do not weep\" severed it. \"Do not kill\", \"Do not kill\", said Diti. Subsequently Indra, in deference to the words of Diti, emerged out of the womb. Armed with Vajra, Indra addressed Diti with folded palms, saying, \"O Devi Diti you have slept, with Diti's head towards Diti's feet and Diti's hair falling on Diti's feet\". \"Diti have seized the opportunity and severed into seven pieces the foetus who would have been a slayer of Indra. O Devi shoudn't Diti forgive Indra\"? Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Deeply distressed Diti, having come to know that the embryo had been severed into seven pieces, humbly spoke to the unassailable Indra. \"O Indra, Slayer of Balasura, because of Diti's fault this embryo has been made into seven pieces and rendered useless. In this matter Indra have not committed any fault. This disaster to the embryo has happened contrary to expectations. Hence, Diti seek a favour from Indra. Let these seven pieces become seven guardians of marut regions (regions of the wind). O Son, all these seven are Diti's sons of celestial beauty. They will become pesiding deities for Vata Skandha (divisions of wind) and let them be wellknown as maruts wandering in the universe. Among them, one will move about in Brahmaloka, another in Indraloka, and the third, well known as vayu will move around in the sky. O best of devatas by Indra's command the other four sons will remain celestial, and will range about in four directions. The thousandeyed Indra, slayer of Bala, on hearing Diti's words, addressed Diti with folded palms, saying: \"Everything will, no doubt, happen the way Diti said. Diti's sons will wander about as celestial beings. Prosperity to Diti.\" \"O Rama mother and sons having arrived at this conclusion in the tapovana  ascended to heaven with their desire fulfilled. This is what we have heard.\" \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this is that country which was formerly inhabited by Indra. Here Indra  attended on Diti who achieved the fruit of Diti's austerities. \"O Tiger among men (Rama) this highly virtuous and wellknown son named Vishala was born to Ikshvakus in Alambusa. Where, a city named Vishala was built. \"O Tiger among men (Rama) this highly virtuous and wellknown son named Vishala was born to Ikshvakus in Alambusa. Where, a city named Vishala was built. O Rama mighty Hemachandra was Vishala's son. Hemachandra's successor was the celebrated Suchandra. O Rama son of Suchandra was Dhumraswa, wellknown Sanjaya was the son of Dhumraswa. Prosperous and powerful Sahadeva was Sanjaya's son. Highly virtuous Kusaswa was Sahadeva's son. Brilliant and powerful Somadatta was Kusaswa's son. That Somadatta's son was Kakutstha is wellknown. Son of Ikshvakus, Sumati comparable to devatas, invincible and exceedingly energetic is still ruling this city. By the grace of the Ikshvakus, all the kings of Vishala have been long lived and exalted, valiant and deeply religious. O Rama we shall spend the right happily here. O Best among men On the tomorrow we see Janaka\". Having heard of the arrival of Viswamitra the celebrated Sumati, most brilliant chief of kings proceeded (to receive him). Along with Sumati's spiritual preceptors and relatives Sumati paid Viswamitra great respect, enquired Viswamitra's wellbeing and said: \"O Sage no one is more blessed than Sumati since Viswamitra have favoured Sumati with Viswamitra's arrival in Sumati's country.\"      : Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Getting together they enquired one another's health. And then Sumati spoke to the great ascetic (Viswamitra). \"O Sage, wish you well Who are these two youths who seem to possess the  prowess of celestial beings. They walk with the gait of an elephant or a lion. They are courageous like tiger or a bull. Their large eyes are like lotuspetals. They are armed with scimitars, bows and quivers.

They adorn this land like Sun and moon in the sky holding excellent weapons. These heroes have trodden paths difficult to traverse. For what purpose have they come? I want to hear clearly\". On hearing his words, he (Viswamitra) related all about their stay at Siddhashrama and the slaying of rakshasas. After hearing Viswamitra, the king (Sumati) got exceedingly delighted and extended hospitality in accordance with tradition to the highly valiant sons of Dasaratha, the distinguished guests worthy of honour. The descendants of Raghu (Rama and Lakshmana) having received great honour from Sumati, stayed there one night and thereafter set out for Mithila. All the ascetics, having seen that auspicious city of Janaka worshipfully admired Mithila saying, 'Excellent, Excellent' At the sight of an old uninhabited, beautiful and desolate hermitage in a grove near Mithila, the descendant of the Raghus enquired of the foremost among the ascetics (Viswamitra): \"O Venerable one I wish to know why this auspicios looking hermitage was deserted by ascetics? To whom did this belong in the past.\" Eloquent and brilliant Viswamitra, replied to the descendant of the Raghus saying: \"O Descendant of the Raghus I shall tell all you about this hermitage cursed by the wrath of a great man. O Best among men this hermitage resembling a celestial retreat and wellhonoured even by devatas  once belonged to illustrious Gautama. O Highly renowned prince it was here in ancient times that Gautama in the company of Ahalya practised austerities for several years. The thousandeyed Indra, consort of Sachi, having found an opportunity (during the absence of the ascetic), assumed the guise of the ascetic (Gautama) and said to Ahalya: 'O most beautiful one those overtaken by passion would not await the completion of the menstrual period (favourable for copulation). O woman of fine waist I desire union with you.' O Delight of the Raghus the evilintentioned Ahalya, inclined towards the king of the celestials and  knowing him to be the thousandeyed Indra in the guise of the ascetic, consented for the union. O Foremost of men with her heart's desire fulfilled, Ahalya said: \"O Chief of the celestials I'm satisfied. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of cthe gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects.\" O Foremost of men with her heart's desire fulfilled, Ahalya said: \"O Chief of the celestials I'm satisfied. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of cthe gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects.\" Indra smilingly said to Ahalya, 'O One with lovely hips, I am  gratified. I shall go away the way I have come'. O Rama he (Indra) came out of the leafhut quickly after his union with her, apprehensive of Gautama. Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut. Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut. On seeing him, the face of the Lord of the gods (Indra) turned pale with fear. Having seen the wicked Indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic the gentle sage Gautama got enraged and said: \"O Wicked natured one assuming my form you have done a forbidden act. For that reason you shall be devoid of  scrotum. Cursed thus out of anger by eminent Gautama the  testicles of Indra immediately dropped down on the earth. Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: 'You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama'. Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: 'You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama'. 'When the son of Dasaratha, the unassailable Rama enters this dreadful forest, you will be cleansed (of this sin)'. 'O Wickednatured one by offering hospitality to Rama, without covetousness and passion, you will happily live with me by regaining your present form'. \"Highly powerful Gautama who had performed rigid austerities thus cursed the wicked Ahalya and left this hermitage, for the peaks of Himavat mountain served by siddhas and charanas. Here he performed austerities\"(said Viswamitra).      : Thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Deprived of testicles, Indra with a frightened face addressed hordes of rishis and charanas with agni in the forefront. 'Indra have accomplished the objective of the devatas by creating obstacles to Gautama's austerities, evoking in consequence the wrath of the magnanimous sage'. 'By Gautama's wrath Indra have been deprived of my testicles. Ahalya has been deserted by Gautama. Gautama has lost his ascetic energy through the pronouncement of this great curse'. 'For that reason, O rishis, charanas and great devatas it is your duty to restore Indra's testicles for the benefit Indra have given you'. 'Hearing Indra, all the devatas accompanied by maruts. Lead by the Firegod devatas approached and said': 'This ram (which has received the share of your sacrificial offerings) has testicles. As Indra has been deprived of his own take these testicles immediately and graft them on to Indra'. Hearing the words of the Firegod the pitrudevatas assembled, uprooted the testicles of the ram and grafted them on to Indra. \"O Son of the Kakutsthas from then on the pitrudevatas have been accepting rams without testicles as offerings in a sacrifice, with ram's testicles fitted on to Indra. O Son of the Raghus illustrious Gautama's power of ascetism was such that thenceforth Indra possessed the testicles of a ram. \"Most brilliant Rama therefore enter the hermitage of the pious (Gautama) and liberate this fortunate Ahalya of divine appearance (from the curse).\" In response to the words of Viswamitra Rama and Lakshmana entered the hermitage, Viswamitra in front. Rama beheld the highly fortunate Ahalya, shining brilliantly with the power of her asceticism. She could not be seen even by men, suras or asuras joined together. She looked divine and illusory as if created with special efforts by Brahma. Though not clearly visible, she was shining bright like the light of the full Moon muffled by mists in the sky and like the inviolable light of the Sun reflected in the water.

By the words of Gautama, she became invisible to the three worlds till the appearance of Rama. With the expiry of the period of the curse, the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) speared and she became perceptible when Rama touched her feet.

On seeing Ahalya, her body purified by the power of penance at Gautama's command, the devatas worshipfully exclaimed, 'Excellent, Excellent' Brilliant Gautam, the great ascetic, along with Ahalya, worshipped Rama according to tradition, with delight and continued with his austerities.

                "Rama accompanied by Lakshmana with Viswamitra ahead proceeded in northeasterly direction and reached the sacrificial ground. Rama with Lakshmana told the tiger among ascetics Viswamitra that the preparations or the sacrifice by the illustrious king Janaka were excellent. O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay. O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay. Great ascetic Viswamitra, hearing Rama's words, chose a nottoocrowded place near a watersource for encampment. When the king heard of the arrival of Viswamitra he went forward with Satananda, the blemishless family priest walking ahead in order to welcome him with humility. Eminent officiating priests speedily brought the offerings of worship and paid obeisance to Viswamitra with prayers. Viswamitra received illustrious king Janaka's worship and enquired about the welfare of the king and the conduct of the sacrifice. Viswamitra duly enquired the wellbeing of the sages and the spiritual teachers, priests in right order. And thereafter the rest joined them in great delight. The king then folded his hands in supplication to the foremost of ascetics, Viswamitra, saying \"O Venerable one please be seated along with the eminent ascetics.\" In response to Janaka's words, great sage Viswamitra occupied his seat. Thereafter the family priests, officiationg priests of the sacrifice, counsellors and also the king occupied their seats according to their rank. Thereafter the king looked on all sides and  saw all of them seated  according to their rank and addressed Viswamitra saying: \"Today my sacrifice has been rendered fruitful by the devatas. I have reaped the fruit of my sacrifice today by your venerable presence. O Preeminent among ascetics O brahmana you have come to my sacrificial mandap along with these ascetics Blessed am I Obliged am I. O Brahmarshi learned men say, only twelve days remain for completion of this acrifice. Thereafter O Viswamitra you should see devatas claiming their shares\". Having said this, the king (Janaka) with a cheerful countenance and saluting with folded palms again asked that tiger among ascetics (Viswamitra): \"O Sage (Viswamitra), be blessed.

That hermitage was inhabited by brahmarshis and devarishis, by sages who had attained perfection through austerities, by those resembling fire in brightness, by the magnanimous and the selfrestrained, by those who had conquered anger and controlled their senses, who was devoted to prayers and offerings of libations. Some of them subsisted on water, some on air. Some lived on fallen leaves, some on fruits and roots. The hermitage looked bedecked with valakhilyas (born from Vala of Brahma ) and vaikhanasas (born from the nails of Brahma).

                "Overwhelmed with joy the mighty, heroic Viswamitra upon seeing Vasishta, the greatest among ascetics, was and offered respectful salutations. Adorable Vasishta received Viswamitra with words of welcome and ordered a seat for him. With the sagacious Viswamitra seated the great ascetic, duly offered him fruits and roots. Foremost among kings, the brilliant Viswamitra, having received hospitality from Vasishta, enquired about Vasishta's welbeing Vasishta's austerities, Vasishta's firesacrifices, Vasishta's disciples and trees (in Vasishta's hermitage). Vasishta, too, informed Viswamitra of the welfare of all.

Vasishta, too, informed Viswamitra of the welfare of all. Vasishta, son of Brahma, the greatest among those who recite prayers and possess rich asceticism enquired of king Viswamitra comfortably seated (before Vasishta): \"O King, is it all well with Viswamitra? O righteous one O heroic one are Viswamitra ruling (Viswamitra's subjects) in accordance with the duties enjoined upon the king? Do Viswamitra rule them in conformity with the code of moralit in order to make them happy. Are Viswamitra's servants provided well with their requirements? Do Viswamitra's servants abide by Viswamitra's command? O Destroyer of foes have all Viswamitra's enemies been conquered ? O Tormentor of enemies O Sinless one O Tiger among men is it all well with Viswamitra's army, treasury, friends, sons and grandsons? Highly brilliant king Viswamitra, humbly informed Vasishta that all was well. Both the righteous personalities dwelt at length on various matters and interesting anecdotes with great delight and derived mutual pleasure. O Descendent of Raghu at the end of the conversation, venerable Vasishta, smiling as it were said to Viswamitra O Highy powerful Viswamitra I wish to offer appropriate hospitality to Viswamitra and to Viswamitra's incomparable army. Be pleased to accept it. Please accept the honour Vasishta extends. Being a king, Viswamitra is a distinguished guest. Viswamitra deserves to be treated respectfully in all possible ways\". To these words of Vasishta, the great intellectual Viswamitra said, \"Vasishta has spoken pleasing words. This in itself is hospitality for Viswamitra\". \"O Worshipful one O Profoundly wise one Vasishta is worthy of homage. Vasishta has excellently honoured Viswamitra in all possible ways with whatever fruits and roots available in Vasishta's hermitage, with water for washing feet and for sipping. Vasishta has permitted Viswamitra darshan with Vasishta's revered self. Viswamitra shall leave (now). Viswamitra's regards Look upon Viswamitra with eyes of friendship\". \"O Worshipful one O Profoundly wise one Vasishta is worthy of homage.

Vasishta has permitted Viswamitra darshan with Vasishta's revered self. Viswamitra shall leave (now). Viswamitra's regards Look upon Viswamitra with eyes of friendship\". As the king was addressing thus the righteous and generous Vasishta, repeatedly requested Viswamitra to accept Vasishta's hospitality. The son of Gadhi said to Vasishta, \"O Preeminent among sages, be it so, O venerable one they will be done\". Vasishta who was highly brilliant the greatest among those who meditate (on Brahman) and free from sins was pleased. Thereafter Vasishta called the speckled cow (Kamadhenu): \"O Sabala, come on quick Listen to Vasishta's words. Vasishta has decided to honour this royal saint and Viswamitra's army with excellent food. Make necessary arrangemets. O Kamadhenu quickly entertain Viswamitra and Viswamitra's army for Vasishta's sake with the food of six kinds of tastes (varieties of rich dishes) as desired by each. O Sabala create at once all food items consisting of liquids and solids for drinking, tasting and siping.\" : Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "\"O Destroyer of foes (Rama)\" addressed thus by Vasishta the wishfulfilling Sabala satisfied each one's desires. Sugarcane, honey and fried grain, invigorating liquors in good containers, excellent drinks and varieties of food (were served). Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed). Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed). \"O Rama, Vasistha entertained everybody in Viswamitra's army to their full satisfaction. They were all wellfed and happy. King Viswamitra along with ladies, priests and brahmins including the royal sage were fully satisfied and delighted. Having received the hospitality along with his counsellors, ministers and attendants, Viswamitra, filled with great delight, said to Vasishta\": \"O Brahman you are worthy of worship. I was received with reverence and wellentertained by you. O Sage conversant with speech listen. \"I shall give you a hundred thousand cows in exchange for Sabala. O Respectable one this cow is a gem. A king (along) has a right on jewels, O Brahmin, for that reason, Sabala rightfully belongs to me. Therefore, give this cow\". Addressed the by Viswamitra venerable and righteous Vasishta who was of the earth ascetic replied: \"O King I shall not exchange Sabala for a hundred thousand for even or a hundred crore cows or heaps of silver. O Suppressor of enemies Viswamitra it is not proper to separate this cow from me. The relationship between Sabala and me is permanent like the relationship between a righteous man and his fame. For havyam (oblations to gods) and kavyam (oblations to ancestors), for fulfilling the necessities of life, maintenance of the sacred fire and offering oblations to all spirits of created beings, and for offerings made to the Firegod I depend on this cow. O Royal saint swaha and vashat and various branches of learning are all dependent on this cow. No doubt about it. This one is truly my whole possession, it always gives me contentment. O King for various reasons, I will not give Sabala to you\". To there words of Vasishta, Viswamitra who is skilful in conversation reacted with extreme excitement: \"I shall give fourteen thousand elephants with gold trappings around the neck and girth, and with goads made of gold. I shall give you eight hundred chariots made of gold and decorated with small tinkling bells, each chariot yoked with four white horses. O Maharshi of auspicious vows I shall give you eleven thousand mighty horses of good breed born in good countries. I shall give one crore young cows of various colours. Give me Sabala. O Best of brahmins I shall offer you jewels or gold as much as you desire. I shall give you everything. Give this Sabala to me\". To these words of sagacious Viswamitra the adorable Vasishta replied: \"O King I shall not give Sabala.\" \"This is verily my jewel, my wealth my very life. This is allinall for me. O King verily this Sabala is useful for my darsa and purnamasa sacrifices, for appropriate gifts and various rites. O King this (cow) is undoubtedly the source of all my actions. Why these useless words? I will never give this wishfulfilling cow\".      : Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Rama when sage Vasishta did not consent to part with the wishfulfilling cow, Viswamitra dragged Sabala by force. O Rama when Sabala was being taken away by the powerful king the distressed Sabala thus reflected choked with sorrow: \"I am being carried away by attendants of the king in this greatly distressed and pitiable condition. Have I been abandoned by the magnanimous Vasishta? What harm have I done to the pious maharshi, a compassionate soul? Why does Vasishta forsake me, his auspicious one, despite my innocence and devotion\"? \"O Destroyer of enemies thus thinking and repeatedly sighing, that cow shook off those attendants who were in hundreds and ran towards the feet of the illustrious Vasishta with the speed of the wind. Lowing and moaning, standing before Vasishta, roaring like thunder and of kettledrum, Sabala said: \"O Brahma's son O Venerable one you have abandoned me? For what reason the servants of the king are taking me away from you\"? Addressed thus, Bramharshi said to Sabala, like to a sister whose heart is afflicted with sorrow: \"O Sabala I am not forsaking you. You have done me no harm. This highly powerful king is forcibly carrying you away from me. I am no match for his strength, especially he is a king. Being king, he is a warrior, powerful and lord of the earth. He has an entire akshauhini composed of horses, chariots, elephants and banners. Hence he is stonger\". To these words of brahmarshi Vasishta armed with immeasurable power, Sabala, who knew the use of words, replied with humility: \"O Best of brahmins it is held that the strength of a kshatriya is no greater than a brahmin's. A brahmin possesses great strength his strength is divine. It is greater than that of a kshatriya. Vasishta's power is immeasurable. Even though highly valiant, Viswamitra is not greater than Vasishta in strength. Vasishta's power is unequalled. O Highly fortunate one I am possessed of Vasishta's brahminic power. Command me. I will destroy the insolent and power of that wickedminded one. O Rama to this, glorious Vasishta replied: \"Create an army capable of crushing the enemy power. Hearing Vasishta's words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama Kamadhenu's lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while Viswamitra looked on helplessly. Hearing Vasishta's words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama Kamadhenu's lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while Viswamitra looked on helplessly. Thereafter the king (Viswamitra), having seen his army thus routed, flew into a fury. Wideeyed with anger, Viswamitra sat in his chariot and destoyed the Paplavas with various kinds of weapons. Having seen hundreds of Paplavas crushed by Viswamitra, once again Kamadhenu created out of anger. Sakas mixed with Yavanas. Sakas mixed with Yavanas, resembling golden filaments possessing brilliance and supreme bravery, covered the earth. Sakas and Yavanas, armed with swords and lances, clad in yellow apparel, looking like flaming fire destroyed the entire army. Thereafter, most brilliant Viswamitra released weapons. With these weapons, the Yavanas, Kambhojas and Paplavas were scattered\".      : Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, Vasishta having seen the forces tortured and overpowered by the weapons of Viswamitra said, \"O Kamadhenu create additional forces through Kamadhenu's yogic power.\" \"From Kamadhenu's lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from Kamadhenu's udder Paplavas, weapons in hand, from Kamadhenu's vagina Yavanas, from Kamadhenu's anus Sakas, from Kamadhenu's roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born. \"From Kamadhenu's lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from Kamadhenu's udder Paplavas, weapons in hand, from Kamadhenu's vagina Yavanas, from Kamadhenu's anus Sakas, from Kamadhenu's roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born. O descendant of the Raghus, Viswamitra's army consisting of infantry, elephants, horses, chariots has been entirely destroyed by them instantly. Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced the one hundred sons of Viswamitra to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth) Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced the one hundred sons of Viswamitra to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth) Then one hundred sons of Viswamitra together with their horses, chariots and foot soldiers were reduced to ashes in a moment by the powerful Vasishta. Seeing his sons and army destroyed the illustrious Viswamitra was filled with shame and anxiety. Like the ocean without waves or the snake bereft of fangs or the Sun eclipsed by Rahu, suddenly Viswamitra looked cheerless and dull. Having lost his sons and the army, like a bird with wings clipped, wretched, with pride vanished and confidence shattered Viswamitra fell into despondency. Viswamitra, having entrusted one of Viswamitra's remaining sons to rule the kingdom in accordance with the kshatriya tradition reached the forest. Mighty ascetic Viswamitra, reached the slopes of the Himavat mountain inhabited by kinnaras and uragas (serpents) and performed austerities in order to propitiate lord Mahadeva. After some time, lord of the gods, bestower of boons, Maheswara with the symbol of the bull on the banner appeared before mighty Viswamitra. O King what are you performing the penance for? Tell me what you want? Maheswara is bestower of boons. Speak out you desire (said Lord Siva). Having heard this from the god, Viswamitra who performed the great austerities prostrated before Mahadeva and said these words. O Irreproachable one O Mahadeva if Mahadeva is pleased with Viswamitra, make Viswamitra an expert in Dhanurveda, the science of archery with all it secrets, angas (branches), upangas (subdivisions) and Upanishads. O Irreproachable one whatever weapons are known to devatas, danavas, maharshis, gandharvas, yakshas, rakshasas, be revealed to Viswamitra. O Lord of the gods by your favour let Viswamitra's desire be fulfilled. Lord Mahadeva having said: 'Be it so' vanished. Rajarshi Viswamitra endowed with supreme power became very haughty. Having obtained the weapons, Viswamitra's insolence was greatly accentuated. Like the sea during the full moon, with Viswamitra's increased power (blessed with the invincible strength of the weapons) Viswamitra thought the foremost of ascetics Vasishta was (already) slain. (It shows the height of the king's ignorance and arrogance). Thereafter king Viswamitra having proceeded towards the hermitage (of Vasishta) and released the weapons by the energy of which the entire forest of the ascetics was burnt down. On seeing the weapons discharged by the intelligent Viswamitra saints in hundreds fled in all directions. The disciples of Vasishta as well as animals and birds got terrified by the fear and fled in their thousands in all directions. The great soul Vasishta's hermitage became deserted and silent in an instant like a barren field. Even while Vasistha was repeatedly assuring the saints saying \"Do not fear, I will now destroy Viswamitra, son of Gadhi just as the Sun dispels the morning mist (they fled)\". The infuriated Vasishta who was highly brilliant, foremost among those who meditate said to Viswamitra: \"O Fool this hermitage has been developed over a long time. Why did you destroy it? On account of your wickedness you will not live long.\" Exceedingly furious Vasishta quickly lifted up Vasishta's staff which looked like the staff of Yama (the god of death), like smokeless fire at the time of destruction of the worlds. : Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thus said Vasishta. Mighty Viswamitra lifted up agneya astra (shaft of fire) and discharging it said, 'stay, stay'. Venerable Vasishta, in fury lifted the Brahmadanda which was like another rod of death. And spoke these words: \"O wicked kshatriya O son of Gadhi here I stand. Show me your strength and the pride of Viswamitra's arms. I will destroy them now. O mean kshatriya where does Viswamitra's energy of a kshatriya stand in comparison with the great energy of Brahma? Behold my Brahmabala (Brahman's energy)\". The Brahmadanda (released by Vasishta) put down the dreadful agneya astra released by Gadhi's son just like the force of fire is extinguished by water. The incensed son of Gadhi employed varuna, raudra, aindra, pasupata and aishika  weapons. \"O Descendent of Raghu Viswamitra employed weapons like manava, mohana, gandharva, swapana, jrimbhana, madana, santapana, vilapana, shoshana, darana, vajra weapons, Brahma, kala and varuna pasas, the favourite painaka, daita, shushka, ardra vajras, danda, paisacha, krauncha, weapons, dharmachakra, kalachakra, vishnuchakras, vayavya, mathana, hayasira weapons, kanakala, musala powers, vaidyadhara, kalatrishula, kapala, kankana weapons discharged against Vasishta the best of ascetics.

'O Brahman great ascetic Viswamitra was controlled by Vasishta. O Best of ascetics be pleased and let the worlds be delivered from distress'. At this, Vasishta the most brilliant ascetic became quiet. The humiliated Viswamitra heaved a sigh and spoke these words: Shame Where is the might of a kshatriya? The energy of a brahmin is the real  energy. The staff of Brahma has singly destroyed all of Viswamitra's weapons\". \"Now I have realised the reason. With clear mind and senses, I shall undertake intense penance which will earn me brahminhood\".      : Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

After some time, four sons, Havishyanda, Madhushyanda, Drudhanetra and Maharatha, who (later) wer wedded to truth and duty, were born.\" A thousand years passed. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahma, appeared. He spoke to Viswamitra, the great ascetic, these pleasant words: \"O Son of Kushika with Viswamitra's austerities Viswamitra has won the worlds of the rajarshis. On account of Viswamitra's austerities, Viswamitra is acknowledged a rajarshi\". Having said this the glorious Brahma, supreme lord of the worlds, left for Brahma's abode in Brahmaloka, in heaven accompanied by the gods. On hearing this Viswamitra hanging down Viswamitra's face a little with shame and anger and grief said: \"I have performed intense austerities. Yet rishis and devatas have recognised Viswamitra only as a rajarshi. I think Viswamitra's penance has yielded fruit. \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this celebrated intellectual having decided in Viswamitra's mind once again performed greater austerities. At this time there lived a celebrated king, renowned in the Ikshvakus race, named Trisanku, who was truthful and self restrained. \"O Son of the Raghus (Rama) a thought arose in Trisanku's mind to enter heaven with Trisanku's physical body by performing a sacrifice. Summoning Vasishta he (Trisahnku) communicated Trisanku's intention, but the great Vasishta said it was not possible. Refused by Vasishta, the king went south in order to fulfil Trisanku's purpose and approached Vasishta's sons. Most brilliant Trisanku approached the sons of Vasishta in the place where they had been performing austerities for a long time. There Trisanku saw the famous, exceedingly effulgent sons of Vasishta one hundred in number practising penance. The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of Vasishta, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority. Bowing down Trisanku's face in humility and with folded palms, Trisanku addressed all those distinguished sons of Vasishta saying: The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of Vasishta, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority.

Trisanku pays homage to all the sons of my spiritual guide oblige. You, brahmins are established in austerity. Trisanku bows to you. Trisanku begs all of you to direct Trisanku with composed minds to direct Trisanku in order to attain heaven in physical form'. O Ascetocs after having been rejected by Vasishta. Trisanku does not see any way other than the sons of Vasishta to help Trisanku achieve Trisanku's purpose.

                "O Rama to these words of king Trisanku, the hundred sons of the sage angrily reacted: 'O Evilminded one having been refused by the Guru true to his word, how could Trisanku bypass him and approach us who are mere off shoots (of the main). For all the kings of the Ikshvakus race, their chief priest is their Guru. It is not possible to bypass the spiritual preceptor who is true to his word preceptor. When an adorable sage like Vasishta has already said, it is not possible, how can we help Trisanku conduct such a sacrifice? O Best one among men Trisanku is childish. Return to your capital. O Monarch the most venerable Vasishta is capable of conducting sacrifices performed by anybody in the three worlds. How can we dishonour Vasishta'? Having heard the confused words uttered by the sages in a state of anger, the king said again: \"O Men endowed with the wealth of asceticism I was rejected by my guru and now by his sons. I shall seek another way. Farewell to you\". Having seen his fierce intent, the saint's sons were infuriated. They cursed Trisanku saying, \"Be a Chandala\" With this the highsouled sons of Vasishta entered their hermitage. And one night after the king became a Chandala (a lowcaste man). The king was tranformed into a darkcomplexioned dirty man with dishevelled hair. His body was besmeared with ashes and on his robes lay wreath collected from the cemetery. He had on him dark (soiled) clothes, and ornaments made of iron. \"O Rama seeing Trisanku in the form of a chandala, all his counsellors, inhabitants of the city including his followers fled away. O Descendant of Kakustha wandering alone burning with distress night and day the king went to Viswamitra who was rich in asceticism. O Rama on seeing Trisanku reduced to a useless a chandala, sage Viswamitra was touched with pity\". Exceedingly energetic and deeply pious, he looked at Trisanku who was frightful in appearance and addressed Trisanku with compassion saying, \"welfare to you\". \"O Mighty prince what brings Trisanku here, for Trisanku is the heroic lord of Ayodhya? Whose curse turned Trisanku into a chandala\"? In response to his words Trisanku, who had fallen into the state of a chandala yet proficient in expression, spoke to Viswamitra, expert in speech, with folded hands. \"Rejected by my guru and his sons, what Trisanku achieved was disaster and what Trisanku could not was the fulfilment of Trisanku's wish. O Gentle sage it is Trisanku's intention to enter heaven with Trisanku's physical body. Trisanku performed a hundred sacrifices but did not reap its fruit. O Gentle sage Trisanku has never told a lie in spite of troubled circumstances, Trisanku shall never dabble in falsehood. Trisanku swears upon it by kshatriya morality . Trisanku has performed various sacirifices and ruled over his people guided by the law of righteousness. Trisanku has pleased eminent elders with Trisanku's conduct and character. O Preeminent among sages Trisanku endeavours to do Trisanku's duty. Trisanku intends to perform a sacrifice. Trisanku's gurus do not appreciate this. Trisanku considers destiny to be allpowerful. The effort of a man goes in vain. Everything is controlled by destiny. It is the supreme resort. Trisanku's merits have been destroyed by destiny. Deeply afflicted, Trisanku craves a favour from you. You are fit to grant it. Wish you well Trisanku will not take refuge in anybody. There is no other protector for Trisanku. You are capable of averting Trisanku's reverses in fate with human effort\".      : Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "What the king said was proved by the king's chandala form which the son of Kushika (Viswamitra) heard and out of compassion spoke these sweet words: \"O Descendant of Ikshvakus, O child, welcome. I know you as highly righteous. O eminent among kings fear not. I offer you refuge. O king I shall invite pious maharshis to assist you in the sacrifice which you will be able to perform with great relief. With the present physical body disfigured by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, you shall go to heaven. O King since you have taken refuge in Viswamitra who is the protector of those who resort to him, I think heaven is already within your reach\". Most brilliant Viswamitra having thus spoken, ordered Viswamitra's deeply religious and highly learned sons to make preparations for the sacrifice. Viswamitra summoned all Viswamitra's disciples, and said, \"Children bring here hosts of rishis along with their disciples and friends, officiating priests and persons wellversed in the Srutis. This is Viswamitra's order. If any one should speak with disrespect in response to Viswamitra's order, you may report the matter to Viswamitra in full\". At Viswamitra's command the disciples set out in different directions. And as a result, expounders of the vedas began arriving from various countries. All the disciples on their return, communicated to the sage shining in splendour what the expounders of the vedas had said. Having heard your words, all brahmins except Mahodaya have arrived from all countries. O Preeminent among ascetics Here is what the hundred sons of Vasishta spoke in anger. When a kshatriya acts as a priest for the sacrifice, particularly for a chandala, how can gods and sages partake the offerings? Joining Viswamitra, (in chanting the mantras during the yaga) how will the great brahmins attain heaven after partaking the food offered by of Chandala? O Best among ascetics all the sons of Vasishta along with Mahodaya with their eyes reddened in anger spoke these harsh words\": On hearing the words (of the hundred sons of Vasishta uttered in anger) Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, spoke furiously with eyes reddened in anger. \"Viswamitra is blameless. Viswamitra has practised rigorous penance. These wicked ones who have abused (a sage like Viswamitra) will be reduced to ashes. Caught by the noose of death this day, they shall be brought to the abode of Yama and for seven hundred births, feed on corpses. Reborn as the merciless race of mushtikas, feeding on the flesh of dogs, hideous and deformed, they shall wander in these worlds. The wicked Mahodaya, who blamed a sage like Viswamitra so faultless shall be reborn in the race of the nishadas vulnerable to abuse by all. As a consequence of Viswamitra's anger that Mahodaya, devoid of mercy and taking pleasure in depriving others of their life, will pursue a wretched life for a long time\". The most powerful sage Viswamitra of fierce asceticism fell silent after after uttering this curse in the assembly of rishis.      : Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The most brilliant Viswamitra, having destroyed the sons of Vasishta including Mahodaya by Viswamitra's ascetic power, said this in the midst of saints: \"This religious and generous king born in the Ikshvaku race, wellknown as Trisanku sought Viswamitra's refuge to gain heaven with Trisanku's physical body, Join Viswamitra in the performance of this sacrifice in a manner by which Trisanku attains heaven with Trisanku's physical body\". Agreeing to these words of Viswamitra all the rishis, knowers of spiritual order and endowed with righteousness assembled there said: \"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever Viswamitra says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. Viswamitra will curse us if angered. \"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever Viswamitra says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. Viswamitra will curse us if angered. Hence let the sacrifice be performed in such a manner that the descendant of the Ikshvakus would attain heaven with the descendant of the Ikshvakus' physical body through the spiritual power of Viswamitra. All of you commence the sacrifice\". The maharshis having resolved performed their respective activities relating to the sacrifice. The brilliant Viswamitra acted as the chief officiating priest. The officiating priests proficient in chanting mantras performed in order of their respective ranks all the rites in accordance with the Yojanakalpa adhering to codes and traditions. Long after, the mighty ascetic Viswamitra invoked all the gods to partake their share of offerings. When, the gods invited by Viswamitra did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku: When, the gods invited by Viswamitra did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku: \"O King behold the prowess of Viswamitra's selfearned asceticism. With Viswamitra's spiritual might, Viswamitra shall send Trisanku to heaven with Trisanku's physical body O King go to heaven with physical body which is not possible for anybody to accomplish. By the power of what little fruit of austerities Viswamitra have earned, Viswamitra shall send to heaven with Trisanku's body\". \"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) when Viswamitra had said these words, the king with Trisanku's physical body ascended to heaven in the presence of the sages. On ascending to heaven Trisanku saw Indra (destroyer of Paka) along with hosts of gods. Indra said to Trisanku: \"O Trisanku you are not fit to inhabit heaven. Go back, you fool Doomed by the curse of Trisanku's spiritual preceptor, fall on earth, head down. Thus spoken to by Indra, Trisanku crying, \"O Viswamitra, Protect me, Protect me\" started falling down. Having heard the wailing Trisanku, the enraged Viswamitra shouted, \"Stay, Stay\". Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma. Overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction. Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma. Overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction. Having created a constellation of stars, Viswamitra out of anger said, \"I will create another Indra or this world will be without Indra\" and commenced to create even gods. Having created a constellation of stars, Viswamitra out of anger said, \"I will create another Indra or this world will be without Indra\" and commenced to create even gods. Struck with wonder and fear, hosts of rishis, suras and asuras humbly addressed Viswamitra. \"O Glorious maharshi, this king cursed by Trisanku's spiritual preceptor is not worthy of going to heaven with Trisanku's physical body\". The son of Kushika (Viswamitra), the preeminent ascetic heard the gods and said these praiseworthy words: \"Viswamitra wishes you well Having promised king Trisanku ascent to heaven with Trisanku's physical form, Viswamitra does not wish to go back on Viswamitra's word. Let this heaven be an eternal abode for Trisanku in Trisanku's physical form All these stars created by Viswamitra shall endure as long as the worlds survive. O gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this\". Let this heaven be an eternal abode for Trisanku in Trisanku's physical form All these stars created by Viswamitra shall endure as long as the worlds survive. O gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this\". Thus addressed, all the gods, replied to the preeminent ascetic, \"O Best among sages, be blessed let Viswamitra's will be done. Those many celebrated stars shall stay on all sides outside the path of Vaisvanara (zodiac) in the firmament. Amidst those stars, Trisanku, shining brilliantly like an immortal, shall stay on, head down\".

These stars will follow this illustrious one (Trisanku), the best of kings who gained Trisanku's object, as if Trisanku had attained heaven. In this manner extolled by all devatas and rishis, mighty and righteous Viswamitra said, 'well let it be so'. \"O Best among men (Rama) then at the conclusion of the sacrifice the great gods and saints went the way they had come\".      : Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Tiger among men (Rama) thereafter great Viswamitra seeing the departing sages of the forest said: \"O Highsouled sages, there is lake Pushkara in the vast western region. There in the forest fit for austerities we shall practise penance peacefully\". With this the most powerful sage Viswamitra reached Pushkara where living on fruits and roots, Viswamitra carried out intense, unsurpassable, austerities. At this time Ambarisha, a wellknown king of Ayodhya, launched preparations for a sacrifice. While Ambarisha was performing the sacrifice Indra stole away the sacrificial animal. The animal could not be traced. Hence the priest said to Ambarisha: \"O King the animal has been stolen away and because of Ambarisha's inability to enforce law, it could not be traced. O Lord of men the king who fails to protect (his dependents) perishes by his own faults. \"O Best of men Ambarisha you must pay a big price for this. Bring either the beast or a man immediately so that the sacrifice can be completed\". \"O Best of men (Rama) hearing the words of the high priest, the highly intellectual king Ambarisha searched for a human victim in exchange for thousands of cows. O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king Ambarisha scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till Ambarisha saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with sage Richika's sons and wie. O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king Ambarisha scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till Ambarisha saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with sage Richika's sons and wie. The most brilliant king Ambarisha bowing to sage Richika, a brahmarshi who looked extremely resplendent with penance, propitiated sage Richika, enquired about the welfare of all and finally said\": \"O Fortunate descendent of the Bhrigu race if sage Richika's son is sold as a sacrificial animal in exchange for a hundred thousand cows, Ambarisha's purpose will be answered. Ambarisha has roamed all countries but could not final the sacrificial animal. Should not Richika spare one of sage Richika's sons for a price\"? Thus addressed the exceedingly brilliant Richika said, \"O Best among men in no way shall I sell Richika's first born\". Having heard Richika, the miserable mother of great sons, addressed Ambarisha, the foremost of men, saying: Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. \"O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son\". Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. \"O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son\". \"O Best among men generally, the eldest sons are the favourites of their fathers, the youngest their mothers: For that reason, I shall keep my youngest son. O Rama the sage Richika and sage Richika's wife having spoken thus, their middle son Sunassepha said on his own: O King my father Richika says his eldest son cannot be sold, mother says that her youngest son Sunaka cannot be spared. From this I think middle son Sunassepha is already sold away. Therefore, take me\" \"O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) having purchased Sunassepha for a hundred thousands of cows the king Ambarisha refurned immensely pleased.",
                "O Foremost of men, O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) the illustrious king (Ambarisha) took Sunassepha with him. (On the way) at Pushkara the king (Ambarisha) took some rest at noon. While the king (Ambarisha) was resting at Pushkara, the famous Sunassepha, very much distressed, happened to see his maternal uncle Viswamitra in the company of other sages performing austerities. With Sunassepha's face discoloured due to thirst and fatigue, Sunassepha immediately fell into the sage's (Viswamitra's) lap in a pitiable condition and said: \"O Noble man O Preeminent among ascetics I have no mother nor father nor friends nor relatives. You should protect me according to dharma. O Best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody. You are promoter of others' welfare. May the king (Ambarisha) fulfil his purpose.

May the king (Ambarisha) fulfil his purpose. May I live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance. May I enjoy heaven. O Virtuous one with a kind heart protect this orphan. Like a father who protects his son, save me from this peril\". Having heard Sunassepha, mighty ascetic Viswamitra consoled Sunassepha in many ways and said to Viswamitra's sons: O sons of the sage this young boy has sought Viswamitra's protection. O Sons you may grant Sunassepha his desire by merely offering your life. Engaged in the observance of righteousness, all of you have done virtuous deeds. By becoming sacrificial animals for the king (Ambarisha), you may satisfy Agni. Then Sunassepha will be protected. The king's (Ambarisha's) sacrifice will continue without hindrance. The gods will be gratified. Viswamitra's words also will come true\". \"O Best of men (Rama) in response to the words of the sage Madhuchanda and others said thus in a casual way with selfesteem. O Lord protecting other's son by abandoning one' own is like partaking the flesh of a dog. We consider it a prohibited act\". On hearing the words of Viswamitra's sons Viswamitra, the eminent ascetic, eyes reddened with anger began to speak: \"(You have) not only trangressed Viswamitra's words but also (you are) censurable according to dharma. You have uttered such audacious and dreadrul words causing the hair to stand on end. All of you shall live on earth for a thousand years, like the sons of Vasishta feeding on the flesh of dogs\". Viswamitra the best of ascetics, thus cursed Viswamitra's sons. Sunassepha, (now) was filled with distress. To relieve Sunassepha of his pain Viswamitra said: \"Bedaubing your person with red sandal paste and adorned with red garlands, you will be bound to a Vaishnava, sacrificial post with sacred ropes. There invoke Agni with these hymns. O Son of sage chant thse two sacred mantras in the sacrifice of Ambarisha.There after you will achieve success (long life)\". Sunassepha memorized the two verses with concentration of mind and hastened towards Amabarisha, a lion among kings. And said: \"Endowed with great strength, you are a lion among kings. We shall go to the sacrificial assembly without delay. O Indra among monarchs, take up initiatory rites and perform the sacrifice\". At the words of the sage's son, the king (Ambarisha), eager with delight hastened towards the sacrificial ground. With the consent of the officiating priests the king (Ambarisha) invested Sunasepha with the sacred symbols with Kusa grass, dressed Sunassepha in red apparel and tied Sunassepha to the sacrificial post as a sacrificial animal. Thus bound, the son of the sage praised the two devatas, Indra and Upendra with moving words. \"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) Indra, gratified with the secret hymn granted Sunassepha long life. O Foremost of men O Rama the king (Ambarisha) also obtained from the sacrifics innumerable rewards by the grace of Indra several times greater than expected. O Best among men the righteous and mighty ascetic Viswamitra also continued Viswamitra's austerities at Pushkara for a thousand years\".      : Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "All the gods wanted to bestow the fruits of austerties on the mighty ascetic (Viswamitra). They approached Viswamitra after a thousand years of penace and Viswamitra's final ritual bath. Exceedingly effulgent Brahma spoke to Viswamitra, \"You have become a rishi through the selfearned sacred deeds. Fare you well\". Brahma, the lord of the gods, having said this returned to heaven. The brilliant Viswamitra continues Viswamitra's austerities. \"O Foremost of men after a long lapse of time a chief nymph called Menaka came to bathe at Pushkara. There the most brilliant son of Kusika Viswamitra saw Menaka whose beauty was incomparable. Menaka looked like lightning in the clouds. On seeing Menaka Viswamitra came under the influence of the god of love (fell in love with Menaka). Viswamitra said, O Apsara welcome to my hermitage stay here. I am infatuated with Menaka: Oblige Viswamitra. Wish Viswamitra well. \"O Descendant of Raghu while Menaka of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily\". \"O Descendant of Raghu while Menaka of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily\". As the period passed, Viswamitra the mighty ascetic was filled with grief, anxiety and remorse. O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) a sense of indignation filled the mind of the ascetic. 'All this is the conspiracy of the gods to deprive Viswamitra of Viswamitra's great austerities', Viswamitra thought. Night and day deluded by lust Viswamitra have wasted ten years. A hindrance has been posed (to Viswamitra's tapas). \"O Rama Viswamitra, the best of ascetics sighed with repentance, distressed with grief. On seeing Viswamitra, the apsara started trembling in fear. The apsara stood before Viswamitra with folded palms.

And performed rigid austerities on reaching the bank of river Kausiki. O Rama while Viswamitra was performing rigorous penance for a thousand years on the northern mountains, the gods were gripped with fear. (lest Viswamitra should exceed them). After consultations the gods and sages decided that this son of Kushika (Viswamitra)  deserved the status of a Maharshi\". Having heard the gods, the Grandsire of the worlds (Brahma) addressed  Viswamitra whose wealth was Viswamitra's ascetism in these sweet words. \"O Maharshi O Child welcome Pleased with Viswamitra's intense austerities, O Son of Kushika I confer upon Viswamitra the eminent rank of a great rishi (maharshi)\". Having heard the words Brahman, the lord of all the worlds, Viswamitra whose wealth was Viswamitra's asceticism was neither dejected nor delighted. Then the mighty ascetic Viswamitra bowed to Brahma, the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded hands and replied: \"O Adorable one, if you have conferred the incomparable title of 'Maharshi' earned by Viswamitra's auspicious deeds, Viswamitra feel Viswamitra have conquered the senses.\" Then Brahma said to Viswamitra, 'You have not conquered the senses yet. O Tiger among ascetics, strive still.' Having said this Brahma went toward heaven. After the departure of the gods, mighty ascetic Viswamitra raised Viswamitra's arms up, stood without support, subsisting on air, continuing with Viswamitra's austerities. Viswamitra whose wealth was Viswamitra's penance carried on Viswamitra's rigid austerities for a thousand years amidst five fires, in summer, under the open sky in monsoon, and   immersed in ater night and day in winter. When the mighty asetic Viswamitra was peforming penance, the gods as well as Indra  got deeply perturbed. Indra along with all the maruts spoke to the celestial nymph Rambha, words that augured well for the gods and maruts and not for kaushika (Viswamitra).      : Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",

Viswamitra will ceratinly release on Viswamitra's dreadful anger (curse me). O Lord this is my apprehension. You should excuse me'. O Rama having heard Rambha trembling in fear and standing with folded palms, Indra spoke: 'O Rambha have no fear. Feel safe. Carry out Indra's order.

At these words (of Indra), Rambha, assumed any form of excellent beauty and with a bright smile set out to allure Viswamitra. Excited by the charming warble of the cuckoo, Viswamitra opened his eyes. On hearing the sound of the incomparable song of the cuckoo along with the sight of Rambha, a doubt arose in the mind of the ascetic. Son of Kushika, the eminent ascetic knew it was the work of Indra. Seized with anger, Viswamitra cursed Rambha: 'O luckless Rambha, since Rambha have endeavoured to distract Viswamitra from Viswamitra's desire to conquer wrath and passion, Rambha shall turn into a rock and remain so for ten thousand years'. 'O Rambha an effulgent brahmin, endowed with the power of asceticism, will liberate Rambha from this state into which Rambha has fallen on account of Viswamitra's anger'.

This mighty curse, of the great saint transformed Rambha into a rock and sent Kamadeva and Indra to their heels. \"O Rama highly powerful Viswamitra was deprived of Viswamitra's ascetic merit due to Viswamitra's anger. Viswamitra had no peace of mind for Viswamitra's inability to control Viswamitra's senses. Having been deprived of Viswamitra's ascetic merit, Viswamitra resolved not to lose Viswamitra's temper nor ever breathe a word\". \"Further, I shall not even inhale for hundreds of years. I shall conquer my senses and dry up this body. Until brahminhood is obtained by my austerities, I shall stay without breathing or eating for innumerable years.

Having observed a unique vow of silence for a thousand years, O Rama Viswamitra practised unprecedented and extremely difficult austerities. After completion of a thousand years the great ascetic became a piece of wood. In spite of many impediments, Viswamitra was unshaken, anger did not enter into Viswamitra's mind. O Rama with firm determination Viswamitra practised austerities.

Thereafter the distinguished ascetic practised austerities for another period of thousand years, Viswamitra's breath suspended. While Viswamitra's breath, was suspended, smoke emanated from Viswamitra's head which frightened the three worlds. It appeared as though they were on fire. Thereupon devatas along with gandharvas, pannagas, uragas, and rakshasas, stood bewildered by Viswamitra's ascetic energy. Their own glory was dimmed in Viswamitra's lustre\". Afflicted with anguish, they spoke to the Grandsire (Brahma): \"O Lord the great sage Viswamitra was lured and angered in various ways. But Viswamitra's austerities continued to grow: Viswamitra's penance was flawless. If Viswamitra's wishes were not granted, Viswamitra will surely destroy by Viswamitra's austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables. Viswamitra's penance was flawless.

The people of all the three worlds are agitated and confused in mind. The Sun, too, looks pale before the brilliance of the Maharshi. O Lord before this mighty, venerable ascetic, effulgent like fire decides to destroy the three worlds, Viswamitra should be appeased. All the three worlds are burning as though with the fire Pralaya (dissolution). Viswamitra's desire may be granted even if Viswamitra wants to rule the kingdom of the gods. Thereafter, with Brahma in the forefront, the gods spoke to Viswamitra in pleasing words: \"Welcome, O Brahmarshi. We are immensely pleased with your austerities. O Kausika Viswamitra has attained brahminhood by means of Viswamitra's intense penance. O Brahmana I along with the maruts grant you long life. May you prosper O Gentle one now you may go happily\". Mighty ascetic Viswamitra was delighted to hear the words of the Grandsire and the gods. Bowing to all of them Viswamitra thus spoke: \"If brahminhood and long life have been acquired by me by your grace, Omkara, Vashatkara and the Vedas shall accept me as Brahmarshi. (I shall acquire the right to interpret the Vedas and to perform sacrifices.) \"O gods let the son of Brahma and eminent Vasishta who is knowledgeable in the vedas worthy of brahmins and archery worthy of kshatriyas address me as 'Brahmarshi'. If this supreme desire is granted, O Best of devatas all of you can go\". Thereupon, pleased by the gods, Vasishta, the best among ascetics, lovingly said to Viswamitra \"You are a Brahmarshi, let it be so\". \"You are a Brahmarshi, no doubt. You will achieve ascetic perfection\", said the gods and returned to their respective places from where they had come. Virtuous Viswamitra also, having attained excellent brahminhood, worshipped Brahmrshi Vasishta who was the best of those who recite hymns\". This illustrious sage having fulfilled Viswamitra's desire, wandered over the earth fixed in asceticism. O Rama thus Viswamitra acquired brahminhood. O Rama Viswamitra is the foremost of ascetics, an embodiment of asceticism, always intent on virtue. Viswamitra is the ultimate repository of ascetic energy\". Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra): Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra): \"O Righteous one O Preeminent among ascetics you have come to my sacrifice accompanied by the descendants of Kakustha (Rama and Lakshmana). I am blessed by your presence and am highly favoured. O Excellent ascetic O Brahmana I am sanctified with your presence. I have derived immense benefits from your visit. O powerful Brahmarshi distinguished Rama and I have heard Viswamitra's great austerities which were related in detail (by Satananda). Many of Viswamitra's virtues have been heard by the members of the assembly present at the sacrifice. Viswamitra's austerities are immeasurable, Viswamitra's power is immense. O Son of Kushika (Viswamitra), Viswamitra's virtues cannot be measured. O Lord I am never tired of listening to Viswamitra's marvellous deeds. O Excellent among ascetics the Sun has set and it is time for evening prayers. O Sage of great austerities come to me tomorrow at dawn. O Excellent ascetic welcome And allow me to leave\".",
                "The day dawned bright and clear when the king (Janaka) performed Janaka's daily routine rites and welcomed the great Viswamitra with the two Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana). The virtuous Janaka paid respects to Viswamitra and the highsouled Rama and Lakshmana in accordance with the sastras and spoke: \"Welcome, O Venerable one O Irreproachable one what can Janaka do for you? Worthy of being commanded, Janaka seeks your orders. At the words of the magnanimous Janaka, the virtuous sage wellversed in speech replied to the heroic king: Dasaratha's sons, (Rama and Lakshmana), kshatriyas renowned in the world are eager to see that great bow in your possession. Be blessed. Show this great bow to the princes. This is Rama and Lakshmana's desire. Once Rama and Lakshmana's desire is fulfilled, Rama and Lakshmana will go back. Thus addressed by the mighty ascetic Janaka replied, \"Janaka shall tell you how this bow came to be deposited here\". \"O Adorable one there was a famous king named Devarata, sixth in line from Nimi. This bow was kept with Devarata in trust by the exalted lord (Shiva). Earlier at the time of destruction of Daksha's sacrifice, Rudra endowed with great prowess lifted this bow sportively and spoke to the gods. 'O gods in your anxiety to partake your share of the sacrifice, you have failed to provide mine in the sacrificial offerings. Therefore, Rudra shall sever your jewelled heads and beautiful limbs with this bow'. \"O Eminent ascetic thereafter all the gods with agitated minds propitiated lord of the gods, Siva and Siva was pleased with them. O Lord that gem of a bow belonging to Siva was given to the great gods who in turn got it deposited in trust with Janaka's ancestor. Thereupon while Janaka was ploughing and cleaning the (sacrificial) ground, Sita, a wellknown name, was lifted up by the blade of the plough. Thus Sita was obtained by Janaka. Arisen from the earth and not from a mother's womb, Sita grew up as Janaka's daughter. Janaka made a stipulation that (this shall be the means to win this maiden as a gift) this shall be given in marriage only to the prince whose prowess is fully tried. O Eminent ascetic arisen from the earth and reared as Janaka's daughter, Sita has been sought after in marriage by many princes. O Worshipful one all those monarchs sought Sita but Janaka did not offer Janaka's daughter saying that the 'marriage offer' could be made only through the tried and tested prowess of a suitor. O Preeminent among ascetics thereafter many kings together came to Mithila to test their prowess. The bow was brought and placed before those who were curious to test their strength but none was able to grasp or lift the bow. O great ascetic Janaka knew those mighty kings had little strength, so Janaka rejected them. O Mighty ascetic, thereafter all the kings doubting their own strength in stringing the bow were inflamed with anger and laid siege on Mithila. Those eminent kings felt humiliated. Inflamed with anger, they tormented the city of Mithila. O Best among ascetics thus one year passed. Everywhere in the city all the means of living were exhausted. Janaka felt deeply sad over this situation. Thereafter, Janaka propitiated the gods by Janaka's austerities. Highly pleased, the gods gave Janaka an army of four divisions (chariots, elephants, horses and infantry). Then those wicked kings who were exhausted were doubtful about their energy. They were beaten and defeated. They fled away along with their ministers in different directions. O Sage you are a tiger among asceties, you are faithful to your vows, Janaka shall show this effulgent bow to your Rama and Lakshmana. O Sage if Rama could lift and string this bow Janaka shall give Janaka's daughter Sita, not born from a woman, to Rama (son of Dasaratha)\". Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "At the words of Janaka, great ascetic Viswamitra said to the king, \"Let the bow be shown to Rama\". Thereafter king Janaka said to his feudatories, \"Let the divine bow adorned with flowers and sandalpaste be brought\". Commanded by (king) Janaka, the ministers went to the city, put the bow in front of them and carried it as per the orders of the king. Five thousand mighty stalwarts drew with great difficulty the eightwheeled cart on which the bow was placed in a box. The counsellors of the king, brought the iron casket containing the bow and said these words to Janaka comparable to a celestial: 'O Indra among kings O lord of Mithila here is the great bow, worshipped by all kings, which you intend to show (to Rama)'. Having heard this, the king with folded hands said to the great soul Viswamitra sitting with the two princes Rama and Lakshmana: \"O Brahman in the olden days, this great bow was worshipped by my forefathers. Powerful kings failed to string this bow. Hosts of devatas, asuras, rakhasas, kinnaras and great serpents, the best of gandharvas and yakshas, also failed (to wield this bow). How then can men bend, string, fix the arrow, pull the string and lift it? O Eminent ascetic such heaviest bow is brought here, O Highly accomplished sage show this to the two princes\". Having heard the words of Janaka, the righteous Viswamitra said: \"O Child O Descendant of Raghu look at this bow\". At the words of the great rishi Viswamitra, Rama opened the casket, beheld the bow and said: \"O Brahmarshi, shall Rama touch this great bow with Rama's hands lift and string it\". The king as also the rishi said \"Be it so\". At the words of the sage (Viswamitra), Rama took hold of the bow by the its middle with ease: Virtuous Rama, the delight of the Raghus, in the presence of several thousands of men fixed the string to the bow and drew it as though with ease. Rama, the best among men, righteous and famous lifted the bow. Stringing it with a twang Rama drew it and broke it into two in the middle. It generated a loud sound like the clap of thunder, like the trembling of the earth and the splitting of a mountain. On hearing the sound, except Janaka, Viswamitra and the two raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) the rest of the people around fell down and fainted. When the people recovered the king skilful in the use of words addressed the eminent ascetic without apprehension with folded palms in the following words: \"O Worshipful one I have witnessed the prowess of Rama, son of Dasaratha. I had not imagined that this marvellous feat could be ever accomplished. By receiving Rama, son of Dasaratha, as her husband, my daughter Sita will bring glory to my dynasty. O Son of Kausika I announce Sita to be the 'Reward of prowess'. My vow has come true. Sita is more valuable than my life and fit to be given to Rama. O Brahmarshi Kausika, be blessed With your consent my ministers will take the chariots to Ayodhya immediately. That Sita, the reward of prowess is to be given to Rama be reventially communicated in detail to king Dasaratha and king Dasaratha may be conveyed here. The welfare of the descendant of Kausika (Rama and Lakshmana) under the protection of sage (Viswamitra) be reported to the king. The king who will be happy to hear this be brought here by swiftfooted men\". The son of Kausika (Viswamitra) also said, \"So be it\". The virtuous king, having consulted his ministers, despatched counsellors to Ayodhya to communicate to king Dasaratha all that had taken place and bring king Dasaratha (to Mithila). : Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Commanded by Janaka the messengers travelled for three days, rested for three nights on the way and entered the city of Ayodhya along with their horses tired. Reaching the king's palace the messengers said to the doorkeepers, \"Let king Dasaratha be immediately informed that the messengers from Janaka have come\". Having heard their words, the doorkeepers informed the descendant of Raghu (king Dasaratha). Thereafter, with the the king's permission, the messengers entered the royal palace and beheld the aged king Dasaratha who shone like a god. All the messengers, hands folded free from apprehensions, reverentially addressed the king in sweet words. \"O Great monarch Mithila's lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection. \"O Great monarch Mithila's lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection. Janaka, the king of Mithila with the enquiry about your welfare, with the permission of the son of Kausika (Viswamitra) sends you this message: O King It is wellknown that formerly I had vowed to give my daughter to a groom as a reward for prowess. Disappointed when proved powerless, the kings became indignant and opposed me. O King that this daughter of mine has been won by your heroic son Rama who has come here casually led by Viswamitra. O Great king, Dasaratha the divine bow with its limitless glory was broken in the middle by the great self Rama in the assembly of people. Sita is fit to be given in marriage to this eminent Rama as a reward for his prowess. I request you to give your consent to fulfil my vow. O Mighty king be blessed. Come here soon with your preceptors and priest. You ought to be reumitd with Rama amd Lakshmana. O Indra among kings you will not only bring me pleasure, you will also be happy to see your sons. The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra's approval and in line with Satananda's thinking has conveyed these sweet words\". The messengers having said so concluded out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative). The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra's approval and in line with Satananda's thinking has conveyed these sweet words\". The messengers having said so concluded out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative). Exceedingly happy to hear the words of the messengers, the king said to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other ministers. \"The enhancer of the joy of Kausalya (Rama) along with his brother Lakshmana under the protection of Viswamitra is now staying in the coutry of the Videhas.\" Illustrious Janaka desires to bestow his daughter on the descendat of Kakustha (Rama) whose prowess Janaka has witnessed. If you approve the action, of the distinguished Janaka, let us hurry to the city of Mithila. Let there be no delay\".",
                "With the passing of the night king Dasaratha, accompanied by spiritual preceptors and relatives said to Sumantra: \"Let all the officers of the treasury furnished with enough wealth and a variety gems go in advance under escort. Let the four divisions of the army from all the four quarters with elegant palanquins proceed at Dasaratha's command. Let brahmins like Vasishta, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kasyapa, Markandeya endowed with long life, and rishi Katyayana depart in advance. Dasaratha's chariot be yoked and kept ready. Let there be no delay. The messengers (from Janaka) are hastening Dasaratha up\". Let brahmins like Vasishta, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kasyapa, Markandeya endowed with long life, and rishi Katyayana depart in advance. Dasaratha's chariot be yoked and kept ready. Let there be no delay. The messengers (from Janaka) are hastening Dasaratha up\". While the Indra among kings (Dasaratha) proceeded with the sages, the four divisions of the army followed Dasaratha at the command of the king. Covering the distance in four days, they arrived in the country of the Videhas. The fortunate king Janaka, having heard about these tidings, made arrangements to extend to Dasaratha reverential hospitality. King Janaka approached the aged ruler of men, Dasaratha, and experienced great delight. Filled with joy the best of men (Janaka) addressed the best of men Dasaratha: \"O Descendant of the Raghus, O Great king welcome Dasaratha am fortunate to have you, you will experience the pleasure of both Dasaratha's sons having won the reward for their prowess. Most brilliant and adorable ascetic Vasishta surrounded by the foremost of brahmins like Indra by the gods has also arrived by the grace of God. By the grace of God, Janaka have overcome all impediments. By the grace of God Janaka's race has been honoured through alliance with the house of the Raghus distinguished by their valour. O Foremost of men, O Best of kings, tomorrow at dawn after the completion of the sacrifice, you should perform the marriage with approval by the sages\". At these words, the most eloquent king (Dasaratha) made Dasaratha's reply in the midst of sages: \"Dasaratha have heard that acceptance of a gift from the righteous is a pleasure. So Dasaratha will act upon your word\". Janaka was filled with extreme admiration to hear one who was truthful, righteous and famous (this Dasaratha). Thereupon hosts of sages in one another's company, filled with great delight spent the night comfortably. The king (Dasaratha) was greatly delighted on being reunited with Dasaratha's sons Rama and Lakshmana. Honoured by Janaka, Dasaratha spent the night with supreme satisfaction. Mighty philosopher Janaka also performed the sacrificial rites and spent the night (there where the sacrificial ceremony was performed) with Janaka's both daughters.      : Thus ends the sixtynineth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter at dawn after the maharshis had performed their daily (sacrificial) rites the eloquent Janaka said to the chief priest Satananda: \"The extremely righteous, renowned and most brilliant Kusadhwaja, Janaka's younger brother is (at present) ruling the sacred kingdom of Sankasya, which is like the aerial chariot Pushpaka, with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious, sacred river Ikshumati. \"The extremely righteous, renowned and most brilliant Kusadhwaja, Janaka's younger brother is (at present) ruling the sacred kingdom of Sankasya, which is like the aerial chariot Pushpaka, with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious, sacred river Ikshumati. Janaka desires to see Kusadhwaja who Janaka has accepted as the protector of the sacrifice. Janaka wants that Janaka's glorious brother Kusadhwaja should share this pleasure, with Janaka\". Janaka having said so in the presence of Satananda gave instructions to a few faithful attendants who were present. In obedience to the command of Indra among men (king Janaka), the messengers rode away on swift horses to bring king Kusadhwaja, a tiger among men just like fetching Visnu by the orders of Indra. The messengers reached Sankasya, met Kusadhwaja and related to Kusadhwaja what had happened. They informed Kusadhwaja of the intention of (king) Janaka. Kusadhwaja having heard the events from the loyal, mighty messengers set out for Mithila in compliance with the request of the king (Janaka). There Kusadhwaja saw the highsouled Janaka devoted to righteousness. Having paid his regards to Satananda and the virtuous king he occupied an exalted seat befitting a king. The two heroic brothers endowed with great splendour seated beside each other, despatched Sudamana the wisest of ministers (to Dasaratha). \"O Foremost among counsellors, go speedily and bring along with his ministers and sons the invincible Dasaratha of the Ikshvakus dynasty whose splendour is immeasurable\". Having reached the tent, Sudamana saw Dasaratha, perpetuator of the race of the Raghus and bowing down his head, said: \"O Heroic lord of Ayodhya, Janaka, the lord of Mithila desires to see you along with preceptors and priest\". King Dasaratha on hearing the words of the best of the counsellors reached the place where Janaka was waiting with hosts of rishis and relations. The king (Dasaratha), skilled in speech, accompanied by counsellors and kins said to Janaka, the lord of the Videhas: \"O Great king venerable Vasishta is the spiritual protector of the Ikshvakus race and it is known that for all ceremonies Vasishta is our spokesman\". \"Having been permitted by Viswamitra, along with all maharshis virtuous Vasishta will tell you in detail about Dasaratha's race\". Having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings, Dasaratha remained silent. Then Vasishta, the venerable sage, wellversed in speech spoke to the Lord of Videhas (Janaka) in the midst of priests. Having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings, Dasaratha remained silent. Then Vasishta, the venerable sage, wellversed in speech spoke to the Lord of Videhas (Janaka) in the midst of priests. \"From the unmanifest was born the eternal, the constant, the imperishable Brahma. To Brahma was born Marichi and to Marichi, Kasyapa. Kasyapa begot Vivasvan and Vivasvan, Manu. Ikshavaku was the son of Manu otherwise called Prajapati or Vaivasvata. It may be noted that Ikshvaku was the first ancestral king of Ayodhya whose son was the wellknown, glorious Kukshi. Prosperous Vikukshi was Kukshi's son, who brought forth brilliant and powerful Bana. Bana's son was the most brilliant and valiant Anaranya whose son Pruthu was succeeded by Trisanku. Trisanku's famous son was Dundumara also known as Yuvanashva whose son was king Mandhata. Mandhata's son was prosperous Susandhi who brought forth two sons Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit. To Dhruvasandhi was born the wellknown Bharata who begot the vigorous Asita. Valiant kings belonging to the races of the Haihayas, Talaiangha, and Sasibindus became the enemies to Asita. The king Asita who was a weakling was defeated in the conflict against the kings and was exiled. Along with his counsellors he lived at on the Bhriguprasravana Himavat mountain. It is said that Asita's two wives were pregnant. One gave food mixed with poison to the other with the intention of destroying her embryo. At that time Chyavana of the family of Bhrigu liked to stay at Himavat, the great, pleasant mountain. That the lotuseyed and highly accomplished Kalindi, offered herself for a son to Chyavana who was glowing like a god. Having approached the ascetic. Kalindi paid obeisance to him who said: 'O Great lady a child of high prowess, lustre and virtues is growing in your womb. In a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison (administered to you) will be born. O Lotuseyed lady, do not grieve'. 'O Great lady a child of high prowess, lustre and virtues is growing in your womb. In a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison (administered to you) will be born. O Lotuseyed lady, do not grieve'. This eldest queen who was a devoted wife, afflicted with sorrow due to loss of her husband gave birth to a son by the grace of Chyavana. Since poison was given to her by her rival queen with the intention of destroying the embryo, the son was born with poison and so came to be known as Sagara. Asamanja was the son of Sagara and to Sagara was born Anshuman. Dilipa was the son of Anshuman and father of Bhagiratha. Bhagiratha begot Kakustha whose son was Raghu. Powerful Pravriddha was Raghu's son. Pravriddha became Purushadaka (cannibal), on curse of Vasistha. Pravriddha grasped water in order to retaliate Vasishta but was prevented by his wife. The water fell on Pravriddha's feet and Pravriddha came to be known as Kalmashapada (feet polluted with water). Samkhana was born to Kalmashapada. Sudarsana was the son of Samkhana. Samkhana's son was Agnivarna. To Agnivarna was born Sighraga and to Sighraga, Maru. To Maru, was born Prasusruka and to Prasrusuka, Ambarisha. Sudarsana was the son of Samkhana. Samkhana's son was Agnivarna. To Agnivarna was born Sighraga and to Sighraga, Maru. To Maru, was born Prasusruka and to Prasrusuka, Ambarisha. King Nahusha was the son of Ambarisha. To Ambarisha was born Yayati whose son was Nabhaga. Nabhaga's son was Aja. Aja was the father of Dasaratha and Dasaratha, the father of Rama and Lakshmana.",
                "Vasishta having thus described (the genealogy of Dasaratha) Janaka with folded hands rejoined, \"Be blessed. Let me relate the genealogy of my race. Listen\". \"O Great sage O Best of ascetics while one offers **Janaka's** daughter (in marriage), one born in a noble family should describe **Janaka's** genealogy in full. Listen. There was a great man of religion king Nimi, strongest of men and wellknown in the three worlds by **Nimi's** own acts. Nimi begot a son named Mithi who constructed Mithila. Mithi was the first Janaka whose son was Udavasu. Virtuous Nandivardhana was the son of Udavasu whose son was Suketu. Suketu's son was the righteous and powerful Devarata, father of Brihadradha. Brihadradha's son was the heroic and powerful Mahavira, father of Sudhruti, who was armed with courage and the power of truth. To Sudhruti was born the righteous Drishtaketu, committed to dharma. Rajarshi Drishtaketu was father to the wellknown Haryasva. Haryasva's son was Maru, father of Pratindhaka. Pratindhaka's son was the righteous king Kirtiratha. The son of Kirtiratha was known as Devamidha. **Devamidha's** son was Vibudha, father of Mahidhraka. Mighty king Kirtirata was the son of Mahidhraka. Kirtirata was a Rajarshi, father of Maharoma. To Maharoma was born the virtuous Swarnaroma. Swarnaroma's son was Hrasvaroma. Hrasvaroma, was a religious king. Hrasvaroma was a great soul. Of **Hrasvaroma's** two sons. Janaka am the eldest and valiant Kusadhwaja is Janaka's younger brother. Janaka's father king Hrasvaroma crowned Janaka king, entrusted Kusadhwaja to Janaka's care and retired to the forest. After Janaka's aged father attained heaven, Janaka looked after Janaka's brother Kusadhwaja, who resembles the celestials, affectionately and ruled the kingdom with righteousness. A little later a powerful king named Sudhanva from the city of Sankasya beseiged Mithila. Sudhanva sent Janaka a message: 'give me the great bow of Siva and the lotuseyed maiden Sita'. O Brahmarshi when Janaka refused, a great conflict broke out between Sudhanva and Janaka. In the encounter king Sudhanva was killed by Janaka. O Best of ascetics having killed king Sudhanva, Janaka has crowned Janaka's heroic brother Kusadhwaja in Sankasya. O Great ascetic (Vasishta), Kusadhwaja is Janaka's youger brother and Janaka am the elder one. O preeminent among ascetics with immense pleasure Janaka am giving these maidens, Sita to Rama and Urmila to Lakshmana. Be blessed Janaka offer Janaka's daughter Sita, who looks like a celestial maiden as reward for (Rama's) prowess and Janaka's second daughter Urmila (to Lakshmana). Janaka proclaim it three times so that there is no doubt about it. O Delight of the Raghus (King Dasaratha), Janaka offer these brides with immense pleasure to Rama and Lakshmana. You may perform the rites for your forefathers by gift of cows. Prosperity to you. Thereafter you may perform the marriage.

                "When Janaka the valiant king of Videha thus spoke (on the genealogy of his family) the mighty ascetic Viswamitra accompanied by Vasishta said to Janaka: \"O Preeminent among men the glory of the two races of Ikshvakus as always of Videhas is in comprehensible and immeasurable. There is none equal to these kings of the Ikshvakus and Videhas. O King it is a perfect match between Sita and Rama and Urmila and Lakshmana. In respect of piety and beauty the match is perfect. O Best of men my words deserve to be heard. This younger brother king Kusadhwaja is knower of righteousness. O King, O Eminent among men we seek the hands of this virtuous king's two daughters, unrivalled in beauty, on earth, as consorts. O king we choose your brother's daughters for the great souls: the young Bharata and the sagacious Satrughna. Bestowed with youth and beauty, these sons of Dasaratha resemble kings in defending the worlds and gods in valour. O King of kings (Janaka) the bond between your race with its pious deeds and the Ikshvakus may be strengthened by this alliance\". Having heard the words of Viswamitra which echoed the wish of Vasishta, Janaka replied to the eminent ascetics with folded palms. \"Since both of you, eminent ascetics, recomended this befitting alliance of the two races on your own, I regard my race as blessed. \"Let it be so, Be blessed Let these two daughters of Kusadhwaja (Srutakirti and Mandavi) be the wives of Satrughna and Bharata respectively and serve Satrughna and Bharata. O Great ascetic let the valiant four princes take the hands of four princesses on the same day. \"The wise, O Brahmin think the marriage is favourable when Bhaga is Prajapati on the succeeding day of the ascent of the two stars. (that is, when poorva is followed by uttara phalguni). King Janaka, having spoken these pleasing words, stood up and with folded hands addressing both the great ascetics: \"You have earned me a great religious merit. I shall be always your disciple O Eminent ascestics, occupy these important seats\". \"Dasaratha has right on the city of Ayodhya as much as I have on this. This right is unquestionable. So do whatever you think right\". To the words of Janaka, king of Videha, king Dasaratha, the descendant of Raghu cheerfully replied: \"You both brothers are lords of Mithila. You possess countless virtues. You pay regards to many rishis and hosts of kings\". \"Be safe. Be blessed. Let me retire to the camp. I have to perform the rites offerings to the forefathers\". Then renowned king Dasaratha, took leave of the two great ascetics. Then the renowned king Dasaratha took have of the king (Janaka) immediately following the two great ascetics. The king (Dasaratha) reached the abode, performed the sharaddha ceremony in accordance with the scriptures. Next day at dawn at appropriate time he gifted away cows (a ceremony performed by initiating the bridegrooms into the marriage.) For the welfare of each of his sons the king (Dasaratha) religiously gave away a hundred thousand cows to brahmins. Great among men and affectionate towards his children, (king Dasaratha), the delight of the Raghus donated in the name of his sons' donates to the brahmins four hundred thousand cows.

                "The day the king (Dasaratha) made a gift of the best (available) cows the heroic Yudhajit arrived. Yudhajit, son of king Kekaya, Bharata's own maternal uncle met the king (Dasaratha) and enquiring about the king (Dasaratha)'s wellbeing said: \"My father, king of Kekaya affectionately enquires about your welfare. And they whose welfare you seek are hale and healthy. The king of Kekaya, O Indra among kings, O Joy of the Raghus, desires to see my sister's son and on that account Yudhajit went to Ayodhya. O King having heard in Ayodhya that you have arrived in Mithila along with your sons for their marriage Yudhajit came here speedily with a desire to see my sister's son . King Dasaratha, then accorded a warm welcome to the honoured guest.

The giver and the receiver, indeed, attain all ends. Fulfil Janaka's own duty by performing the auspicious marriage\". Thus addressed by the great self Vasishta, Janaka, the exceedingly generous, highly lustrous, eminent in ethics replied. \"Did any guard prevent you? Whose command are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate to enter into your own house? This kingdom is like your kingdom\". O Best of ascetics my daughters have performed all the rites relating to marriage. They (now) stand at the foot of the altar shining like the bright flames of fire. Ready at the altar, I have been awaiting you, O King Without hindrance proceed Why delay?\". At the words of Janaka, Dasaratha brought Rama's sons along with the hosts of ascetics and entered the marriage pavilion.

Then gods and sages exclaimed: 'well, well'. Celestial kettledrums were sounded and there was a steady rain of flowers. Then king Janaka sprinkled on Sita waters sanctified by mantras, and immersed in delight said: \"Lakshmana come and accept Janaka's daughter. Urmila ready to be bestowed upon Lakshmana by Janaka. Take Urmila's hand. Let there be no delay\". Janaka, having spoken thus to Lakshmana addressed Bharata: \"O Descendant of the Raghus hold Mandavi's hand in your own\".

You possess sound character. You are true to your vows. Live with your wives. Let there be no delay\". At the words of Janaka the four princes took the hands of the four sisters with their own with the consent of Vasishta . The great, noble princes of the race of Raghu, accompanied by their wives circumambulated the altar of the sacred fire. King Janaka and the sages in obedience to the directions of Vasishta and in accordance with the sastras conducted the matrimonial.

King Janaka, lord of the Videhas, gave plenty of gifts to his daughters and followed king Dasaratha for some distance on his journey to Ayodhya.

The Lord of Mithila bestowed a lot of wealth on his daughters and with the consent of king Dasaratha reentered his residence in Mithila. King Dasaratha of Ayodhya also left along with his great sons preceded by the sages and followed by the army. While this tiger among men king Dasaratha, was returning with the hosts of sages and his sons, king Dasaratha observed here and there frightening birds making disagreeable sounds. Seeing the beasts on the way rushing to the right the tiger among men, king Dasaratha enquired of Vasishta: \"While the frightening birds are inauspicious, the deer on the right are favourables Why is this? My heart beats. My mind is depressed. To these words of king Dasaratha the great ascetic Vasishta replied in a gentle voice, \"I shall tell you the consequences Listen\". The dreadful cries from the mouths of birds foretell an event of celestial nature likely to befall but the movements other of deer indicate restoration of peace. Therefore do not grieve. While they were conversing, a storm blew, shaking the earth and felling down beautiful trees. The Sun was wrapped in dark. The quarters were devoid of brightness. The entire army was covered with ashes, as if they fainted. At that time Vasishta and other saints, king Dasaratha and his sons held their senses under control. All others lost their consciousness. In that dreadful darkness while the army looked as if covered with ashes, king Dasaratha encountered the repressor of kings, descendant of Bhrugu and son of Jamadagni with a terrible crown of matted hair, inaccessible like Kailasa mountain and unendurable like the fire at the time of dissolution. The laymen gazing at his blazing energy,hanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like Siva at the time of slaying of Tripura.

At the sight of the fearful appearance of Parasurama looking like flaming fire, Vasishta and all other saints who were in the habit of chanting mantras and offering oblations to the fire whispered among themselves: Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is Parasurama intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past Parasurama was freed from anger and grief. Is Parasurama again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas? Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is Parasurama intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past Parasurama was freed from anger and grief. Is Parasurama again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas? The saints having thus talked amongst themselves, offered arghya to the son of Bhargava, of dreadful appearance and addressed Parasurama in soothing words: \"O Rama O Rama\". Valiant Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, having accepted the homage offered by the saints addressed Rama, son of Dasaratha and said:      : Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "O Rama, Rama, son of Dasaratha I have heard in full of Rama's marvellous prowess and Rama's feat in breaking the bow of Siva. The fact that Rama has broken Siva's bow is an astonishing act. It is beyond imagination. Having heard it I have come here with another auspicious bow. This mighty, dreadful bow was obtained through Jamadagni. Rama may display Rama's prowess by fixing on it an arrow. O Rama after witnessing Rama's strength in stretching and stringing this bow, I shall engage Rama in a duel acclaiming Rama's prowess\". When king Dasaratha heard these words, Dasaratha's face fell. Dasaratha humbly pleaded with me, Dasaratha's hands folded: \"You are a brahmana, highly renowned and withdrawn from anger against kshatriyas. It behoves of you to give assurance of security to my sons who are young. Born in the family of (saint) Bhrigu versed in the study of the Vedas and observance of vows. You have promised in the name of the thousandeyed Indra to renounce the arms. By adhering to righteousness in life and having conferred the earth upon Kasyapa, you retired to the forest and made your residence on the Mahendra mountain. O Great ascetic today you have arrived evidently for the total destruction of our family. If Rama is killed none of us will survive\". Disregarding these words of Dasaratha, the valiant son of Jamadagni said to Rama. \"These two excellent celestial bows are wellknown throughout the worlds. They are stout and strong. They are the best of all, wellmade by Visvakarma. O Best among men O Descendant of Kakustha one of these broken by you, was given by the gods to the threeeyed Siva, who, wishing to fight the demon Tripura with this bow, destroyed him. This second bow which is unassailable was given by chief of the celestials to Visnu. O Rama born in the race of Kakutstha this highly radiant bow of Visnu is as strong as the bow of Siva. Then all the gods in order to ascertain the strength and weakness of Siva and Visnu enquired of the Grandsire, Brahma: Foremost among the truthful, Grandsire Brahma come to know the intention of the gods and triggered a conflict between the gods. In that thrilling fight between Siva and Visnu, each desirous of victory over the other, a ferocious battle took place causing one's hair to stand on end. Then, with the 'Humkara' produced by Visnu, Siva's bow of dreadful prowess was stretched, which struck the threeeyed Mahadeva motionless. Then hosts of sages, charanas and the gods assembled there and beseeched both of them, the preeminent among the gods to keep peace. Now that the bow of Siva was made inert by Visnu's prowess, hosts of sages and gods acknowlged Visnu as superior. Glorious Siva, enraged at this, placed the bow together with the arrow in the hands of Rajarshi Devarata in the country of Videha. This bow of Visnu, O Rama capable of conquering hostile cities, was given in trust to Richika belonging to the race of Bhrigu. Brilliant Ruchika gave this bow to his son, the great Jamadagni, my father, a man of unrivalled valour. My father equipped with ascetic energy renounced the weapon and was killed by Kartaveeryarjuna in a vulgar manner. O Rama Having heard the slaying of my father incomparable in extreme ruthlessness, I decimated the Kshatriya race again and again out of fury as they were born and reborn. I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode.

I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode. O Mighty Rama when I heard that Rama has broken the bow with Rama's extraordinary prowess, I have come here quickly. Respect the duties of a kshatriya, O Rama Take hold of this great, uncommon bow of Visnu inherited by me from my father and forefathers. O Descendant of Kakustha this best bow is capable of conquering enemy cities. Fix an arrow. If it is possible for you to do so, then I shall engage Rama in a duel\". Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Hearing the words of the son of Jamadagni (Parasurama), Rama, the son of Dasaratha, avoiding further conversation out of respect for his father intercepted Parasurama saying: \"O Descendant of Bhrigu I have listened to the (marvellous) acts you have performed. O Brahman I commend you for discharging your duty in repaying the debt to your father. You underrate Rama, the son of Dasaratha, O Bhargava as though Rama, the son of Dasaratha, am devoid of valour and incompetent to perform the duties of a Kshatriya. Now witness Rama's, the son of Dasaratha, energy and valour. Having spoken thus, the enraged Rama, gifted with quick vigour, seized the bow and arrow from Parasurama's hands. Infuriated Rama bent the bow stretched it, fixed the arrow and addressed Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni: \"You are a brahmin, O Parasurama. You are also related to Viswamitra. Hence you are worthy of homage. Rama, the son of Dasaratha, cannot, therefore, release this against you to take your life. Rama, the son of Dasaratha, shall destroy your mobility, O Parasurama or the higher worlds earned through your matchless asceteic energy. Tell me which one you choose. On conquering the hostile cities and destroying the pride and strength of the enemy by its prowess, this celestial arrow of Visnu shall not go in vain\". The gods with the Grandsire, Brahma in the forefront, accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see Rama holding that mighty bow. Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder. The gods with the Grandsire, Brahma in the forefront, accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see Rama holding that mighty bow. Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder. Then when Rama stretched the great bow, the world became motionless. The son of Jamadagni, Parasurama, bereft of prowess gazed at Rama, the son of Dasaratha, with astonishment. Parasurama's energy subdued by Rama's, the son of Dasaratha, prowess, the paralysed, Parasurama, son of Jamadagni spoke in gentle words to Rama, the son of Dasaratha, whose eyes resembled the lotus petals: \"When I gave this entire earth to Kasyapa, he said to me, 'you shall not live in my country'. O Descendant of Kakustha having gifted this earth to Kasyapa, I promised him that I would not live here, during night time. For the earth belongs to him. For this, you should not destroy my mobility, O valiant son of the Raghus. I shall go to Mahendra, the best of mountains, with the speed of mind. Strike with the, principal arrow the unrivalled worlds conquered by my asceticism. Do not delay, O Rama By the fact that Rama, the son of Dasaratha, have stretched this bow, I have come to know that you are Visnu, Lord of the gods, slayer of Madhu, O Imperishable one O Tormentor of enemies Fare well. All your deeds are incomparable. You are unassailable in combat. All these hosts of gods have assembled here and are looking at you. I have been defeated by you, O Descendant of Kakustha lord of the three worlds. Therefore, it is not right for Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni, to feel ashamed. You are faithful to vows O Rama This arrow has no equal in prowess. It behoves of you to release it against me. After its release I shall go to the excellent Mahendra mountain\". Thus spoke Parasurama, son of Jamadagni to Rama, the valiant son of Dasaratha who (then) discharged the principal arrow. Having witnessed the destruction of those regions earned by him through asceticism, the son of Jamadagni left for the best of mountains Mahendra. Thereafter all the quarters including the intermediaries were cleared of darkness. Hosts of sages and gods extolled Rama when Rama, the son of Dasaratha, wielded the bow. Parasurama, the competent son of Jamadagni, having praised Rama, the son of Dasaratha circumbulated him and left for his abode.      : Thus ends the seventysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "When Parasurama departed, Rama, son of Dasaratha with a serene mind gave the bow along with the arrow to Varuna of immeasurable strength. Thereafter Rama the descendant of the Raghus, paid obeisance to Vasishta and other rishis, and looked at his father who appeared agitated said: \"Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, has gone. Let the four divisions of the army of which king Dasaratha is the commander proceed towards Ayodhya. The army which is under the command of king Dasaratha O King is awaiting king Dasaratha's orders like the chatakas awaiting water. Direct them (to proceed). On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced Rama and kissed Rama's forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt king Dasaratha and Rama were reborn. On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced Rama and kissed Rama's forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt king Dasaratha and Rama were reborn. Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance. When king Dasaratha reached the city of Ayodhya it looked welldecorated with flags and banners. It resounded with trumpets. The royal highways were sprinkiled with water and strewn with flowers. It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments. Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance.

It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments. Prosperous king Dasaratha of great fame followed by his elegant sons entered the city of Ayodhya while the citizens and brahmins came forward from a long distance to welcome king Dasaratha who reentered his palace looking like the Himalayan mountain. The king and king Dasaratha's kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner. Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides. The king and king Dasaratha's kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner. Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides. Thereafter the queens received the highly fortunate Sita, Urmila of high fame and both the daughters of Kusadhwaja, Mandavi and Srutakirti. With auspicious aricles in their hands, all the new brides who shone in silken apparels immediately went to temples and worshipped the family deities. Then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of Kubera.Thereafter pleased with gifting cows, riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy Then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of Kubera.Thereafter pleased with gifting cows, riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy All the princes who were best of men, great souls, incomparable in prowess on earth, capable of the use of weapons and endowed with wealth moved about with friends, serving their father and following king Dasaratha's commands. After some time king Dasaratha the delight of the Raghu race addressed his son Bharata: \"The heroic Yudhajit son of the king of Kekaya, Bharata's maternal uncle, has come here and wishes to take Bharata with him, O Child O Knower of dharma this was Yudhajit's request to king Dasaratha in Mithila in the midst of sages. You should bring Yudhajit delight (by obliging Yudhajit). Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Bharata, son of Kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and Rama, embraced Lakshmana and prepared for the journey with Satrughna. Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Bharata, son of Kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and Rama, embraced Lakshmana and prepared for the journey with Satrughna. Valiant Bharata, the best of men took leave of his father Dasaratha, a tireless brother Rama and mothers and departed with Satrughna. After the departure of Bharata, mighty Rama and Lakshmana continued to serve their godlike father. Righteous Rama discharged his duties towards the citizens for their allround comfort and welfare giving top priority to (the execution of) the command of his father. With unfailing regularity Rama carried out his duties towards his mothers, and his elders, looking into them from time to time. Dasaratha was pleased with the good conduct and character of Rama. Brahmanas as also the inhabitants of the city and the people of the country at large were happy with Rama. In world the glorious and virtuous Rama armed with the power of truthfulness became the protector of the people like Brahma (to living beings). With Rama's heart fixed on Sita to whom Rama was always devoted, Rama, the wise went about enjoying with Sita (the beauty of) all the seasons. Chosen by king Dasaratha Sita became Rama's beloved wife with Sita's virtue and beauty Rama's affection for Sita grew further. For Sita her husband Rama was doubly dear. They were clearly communicating through each other's heart every thought generated in the mind."

                "Bharata set out for his maternal uncle's house. Bharata took with him the sinless Satrughna who is always successful in destroying foes and on whom Bharata had bestowed Bharata's love and affection. Treated with warm hospitality and fatherly affection by his maternal uncle Aswapati, Bharata stayed on there along with Satrughna. Though both the heroic brothers stayed there satisfied on their own they constantly remembered their aged father. The glorious king Dasaratha also remembered his sons, Bharata and Satrughna, who were like the great Indra and Varuna, (now) away from home. Dasaratha, a bull among men, loved all his four sons equally just as the arms of Dasaratha's own body. Even among them the brilliant Rama was a source of delight to Dasaratha like the Selfborn (Brahma) to all living beings. Entreated by the devatas desirous of slaying arrogant Ravana, the eternal Visnu was indeed born in the mortal world as Rama. Kausalya looked splendid with Rama of boundless energy, as did Aditi with the chief of the gods Indra, wielder of thunder. Endowed with beauty and strengh, free from envy, and in virtues equal to Dasaratha, Rama was verily an incomparable son on earth. With an unfailing serenity of mind, Rama never paid back harshness with harshness. Gifted with selfrestraint, Rama was pleased even with a single benefit done somehow to Rama, yet did not remember even a hundred offences committed by others. Even during intervals of Rama's practice of weapons Rama never failed to interact with saintly persons and with people advanced in age, virtue and wisdom. Wise and softspoken, Rama was the first to speak to others words pleasing to hear. Though mighty, Rama was never proud of Rama's overwhelming strength. Rama never told lies. Rama was a learned man. Rama honoured elders by going forward to them. Rama loved his subjects as much as his subjects loved Rama. Rama was kindhearted and compassionate to the distressed, coolheaded and righteous. A worshipper of brahmins Rama was always selfrestrained and pure in spirit. Rama entertained thoughts befitting Rama's (great) dynasty and honoured the code of conduct of a kshatriya. Rama believed one could attain heavenly abode through Rama's great achievements. A learned man, Rama evinced no interest in pursuits that did not contribute to one's welfare or had Rama any liking for speaking against others. But in debates Rama's oratorical flourish was comparable to Brihaspati's. Rama was young, eloquent, healthy and free from disease. Rama was conscious of (right) time and place (for Rama's pursuits). Rama was capable of ascertaining the potentiality of men. Rama was born a sage in this world. Bestowed with such excellent qualities, Rama became a favourite of his subjects. Rama was like their vital life outside their bodies. With the appropriate sacred ablution marking the completion of the vow relating to the respective branches of learning in accordance with tradition, Rama achieved proficiency in the Vedas and its auxiliary sciences. Rama surpassed Dasaratha in archery. Born in a family of noble descent, Rama was saintly. Rama was a man without meanness. Rama was truthful and a man of rectitude. The training Rama received under aged brahmins conversant with dharma and artha made Rama welldisciplined. Rama knew the true nature of dharma, artha and kama. With a sharp memory, Rama was a genius. Rama was highly skilled in accomplishing tasks related to social practices and customs. Rama was modest and did not reveal Rama's inner feelings. Rama counselled in secrecy and had good friends. Never was Rama's anger or pleasure in vain. Rama knew the occasion when to sacrifce and when to exercise restraint. Rama was firm in Rama's devotion and steady in intellect. Rama accepted nothing ignoble nor used bad words. Rama was not swayed by emotions or prone to idleness. Rama knew Rama's faults as well as of others. Rama was versed in scriptures. Rama was grateful (to those who did Rama some good) and skilled in differentiating the comparative merits of men. Fair in Rama's judgement Rama dispensed justice in accordance with law by reprimanding (the delinquent) and favouring (the honest). Rama was skilled in receiving and encouraging the righteous and in punishing (the wicked). Rama knew whom to punish. Rama knew the right means of raising revenue and also expending money in the prescribed manner. Rama obtained proficiency in scriptures and interconnected (mutually contradictory) branches of learning. Only after having grasped the (philosophy of) artha (statecraft) and dharma (righteousness), Rama sought pleasure. Rama was never indolent. Rama had understanding of art and craft useful for entertainment. Rama knew proper ways of dispensing wealth. Rama was experienced in riding elephants and horses and in humbling them. Rama was the best among those skilled in archery in this world. Rama was reckoned as a great wielder of warchariots and one who strikes at the enemies by advancing towards them. Rama was an expert in commanding troops. (Atiratha is an excellent warrior who can manage his chariot, horses and the charioteer.) Rama was incapable of being repressed even by the enraged devatas or rakshasas in the battle. Rama was free from envy and had subdued Rama's anger and pride. Rama was never malicious and Rama never slighted any living being nor did Rama bow to the pressure of time. Thus endowed with such excellent qualities, the subjects in the three worlds held Rama in high esteem. In forbearance Rama was like the earth, in wisdom like Brihaspati and in prowess like the consort of Sachi (Indra). Rama whose virtues were cherished by all his subjects was a source of delight to Dasaratha and Rama shone like the rays of the resplendent Sun. The earth desired Rama as her lord, for Rama was bestowed with such avowed virtues and with indomitable prowess equal to all the guardians of the quarters. Observing Rama endowed with such innumerable and incomparable virtues, king Dasaratha, subduer of enemies started thinking. Thereafter, flashed in the mind of that aged king who had (already) lived long this pleasant thought as to how Rama will become king while Dasaratha was alive. The thought of seeing Rama coronated repeatedly surfaced Dasaratha's mind so great was Dasaratha's affection (for Rama). (Dasaratha said to himself) 'Rama's only desire is to promote the prosperity of this world. Rama is one who shows compassion to all beings and is like the raingod dearer than me to the people of the world'. 'In prowess Rama is equal to Yama and Indra,in wisdom to Brihaspati and in firmness to a mountain and in virtues greater than me'. 'Seeing my son ruling this entire dominion of the earth, I will experience the bliss of attaining heaven at this age.' King Dasaratha in consultation with his ministers observed that Rama is endowed with various virtues not found in other kings, immeasurable virtues which are praiseworthy, and exemplary. Rama is distinguished in this world as all qualities seem to have merged in Rama. The king then made up his mind to make Rama princeregent. King Dasaratha in consultation with his ministers observed that Rama is endowed with various virtues not found in other kings, immeasurable virtues which are praiseworthy, and exemplary. Rama is distinguished in this world as all qualities seem to have merged in Rama. The king then made up his mind to make Rama princeregent. The sagacious king, too perceived Dasaratha's body ageing and the portentous omens in the heaven, in the sky and on the earth causing dreadful concern. The king realised afterwards that Dasaratha's grief would be dispelled if noble Rama whose countenance resembled the full moon and who was a favourite of the people is crowned. Longing for it, the noble king realized that the time was ripe for the acceleration of the process of safeguarding Dasaratha's own and Dasaratha's subjects' welfare. Dasaratha summoned individually kings and all important citizens residing in various cities and villages of this earth. The king did not invite both the kings of Kekaya and Janaka in haste with an intention that they would hear the glad news at a later date. The king who received them in a befitting manner and provided them with residence and ornaments looked like lord Brahma adorned by the people. After the king (Dasaratha) who was a tormenter of enemy forces was seated, the rest of the kings beloved of their subjects entered (the assembly hall). Then the kings (who entered the assembly) took the seats assigned to them facing the king (Dasaratha), following the royal tradition. Surrounded by those feudatory kings endowed with modesty, and received with due honour and by the respectful residents of cities and villages, the king (Dasaratha), resembled lord Indra, the thousand eyed encircled by the gods. Thus ends the first sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "Thereafter, the lord of the earth (king Dasaratha) addressed the entire assembly of invitees. king Dasaratha spoke these pleasing words aimed at their welfare which thrilled and delighted the hearts (of the assembled kings): Lord of men (king Dasaratha) addressed the feudatory kings with words deep, resonant, loud like the kettledrum or the rumbling cloud, in a delightful, incomparable and attractive voice that carried all the dignity of royalty: Lord of men (king Dasaratha) addressed the feudatory kings with words deep, resonant, loud like the kettledrum or the rumbling cloud, in a delightful, incomparable and attractive voice that carried all the dignity of royalty: It is wellknown to all of you that people of this greatest kingdom were ruled by king Dasaratha’s predecessors who were great kings, who looked after the subjects as though they were their own children. king Dasaratha desire to accomplish the welfare of this entire world which deserves the happiness brought about by the rule of all the Ikshvaku kings. Following the path of king Dasaratha’s forefathers king Dasaratha protected the people to the best of king Dasaratha’s ability by being ever vigilant. king Dasaratha’s body has attained old age after ruling the entire world ensuring the welfare of the people under the shade of royal white parasol. Having lived for thousands of years this body is now worn out due to old age and therefore king Dasaratha want rest. king Dasaratha am weary of carrying on the heavy burden of duty and find it difficult to sustain the rule of dharma. It can be shouldered by those who have royal qualities (of might, courage etc) and not by those who have not controlled their senses. Therefore, after convincing all of you, the best of (learned) brahmins present here, king Dasaratha intend to take rest by installing king Rama to look after the welfare of the people. My eldest son Rama, inheriting every virtue of king Dasaratha, is a conqueror of enemy cities and is equal to Indra in prowess. king Dasaratha propose to install Rama, foremost among upholders of righteousness and the best of men who resembles the Moon in brightness when in conjunction with Pushya star, as heirapparent to the throne. With Rama as ruler, all the three worlds will also have a better protector.That elder brother of Lakshmana with signs of greatness is certainly the most befitting to rule this kingdom. king Dasaratha shall be relieved of king Dasaratha’s anxiety by entrusting the land (ruled by king Dasaratha) to Rama without any more delay and thus ensure the continued welfare of this world. Although king Dasaratha’s decision is personally favourable to king Dasaratha and king Dasaratha have decided after seeking good counsel, you should also give king Dasaratha your consent and tell king Dasaratha what king Dasaratha should do. Although this is what king Dasaratha would like to do, please suggest alternative ways of achieving the welfare (of this kingdom). Deliberations by the unbiased (on this issue) may bring good. Having thus heard king Dasaratha speak, the kings acclaimed king Dasaratha with delight, like peacocks crying (in joy) to see thick clouds. There emanated cries of love and joy from the multitude of people (conveying their approval) whose reverberation seemed to shake the palace. Brahmins, kings and other prominent men, inhabitants of towns and villages having fully known the views of king Dasaratha who was conversant with artha and dharma joined together and deliberated. They thought out well and having arrived at unanimity in their thinking thus addressed the aged king Dasaratha. Brahmins, kings and other prominent men, inhabitants of towns and villages having fully known the views of king Dasaratha who was conversant with artha and dharma joined together and deliberated. They thought out well and having arrived at unanimity in their thinking thus addressed the aged king Dasaratha. O mighty king, you have grown many thousands of years old. Therefore, you should coronate Rama as prince regent of this kingdom. We cherish to see the mightyarmed hero among the Raghus, Rama, riding on a majestic elephant, his countenance shadowed by the royal parasol. Having heard them king Dasaratha, pretending as though king Dasaratha was not aware of their heart's desire but was now wishing to ascertain it, spoke these words: O kings, soon after listening to king Dasaratha’s words, all of you wish Rama to be king. (But) king Dasaratha doubt (in king Dasaratha’s mind) whether you have said it from your heart When the earth is being ruled righteously by king Dasaratha why indeed you intend to see king Dasaratha’s son as prince regent? Those kings along with the inhabitants of towns and villages answered the magnanimous king: O king your son, indeed has many auspicious and admirable virtues. O king, king Dasaratha shall now speak about those great virtues of the sagacious Rama. Comparable to those of the gods, they are dear and a source of delight for every one. Please listen. Lord of the people Rama with his divine virtues is equal to Indra. Rama with his proven valour is exceptional among all the descendents of the Iksvakus. Devoted to truth and righteousness Rama is the most venerable among men in this world. Even righteousness along with prosperity flows directly from Rama. Rama is equal to the Moon in causing happiness to the people, to the earth in forbearance, to Brihaspati in wisdom and to Indra in prowess. Rama knows the ways of righteousness. Rama is true to his word and free from envy. Rama possesses a sound character with forbearance, gentleness and a sense of gratitude. With his senses under control, Rama is a source of consolation (in stressful times). This son of the Raghus (Rama) is softspoken, steadfast, always serene, truthful and free from envy. Rama is pleasing to all beings. Rama serves those elderly brahmins versed in many lores. With these virtues Rama’s incomparable glory, fame and splendour have steadily grown.

Pious, sagacious, free from meanness, Rama is of noble descent. Whenever Rama, wellinstructed in all matters by the best of brahmins wellversed in dharma and artha proceeds along with Lakshmana to wage a war for the sake of a village or a town, Rama never returns without conquering the enemy. While returning from the battlefield, either on a chariot or an elephant Rama stops and enquires in detail and in order, the welfare of the citizens as Rama would do for his kith and kin. Rama enquires about the welfare of their children, sacred rituals, wives, their servants and disciples as a father would enquire of his sons.

Rama grieves profoundly whenever people are afflicted by misfortunes (and) rejoices like a father on festive occasions. Rama is one who speaks the truth. Rama is a great archer, one who has conquered his senses and serves the aged. Rama speaks with a smile and protects dharma with all of Rama’s heart. Rama helps those who take refuge in Rama. Rama is not interested in conversation leading to dissentions. But during debates Rama is eloquent like Brihaspati (establishing the truth on the basis of reasoning). Rama, who is the source of delight to the world, has charming eyebrows and large coppercoloured eyes. Rama is endowed with heroism, bravery and valour like Visnu manifested. Rama is proficient in the ways and means of ruling the people. Rama’s senses are not overpowered by passion. Rama alone is capable of ruling the three worlds, what to speak the earth Rama’s anger or favour never goes in vain. Rama kills those who rightly deserve to be killed and flares not at those whose life is to be spared. When pleased, Rama bestows wealth. Like the Sun shining with king Dasaratha’s rays, Rama shines with king Dasaratha’s qualities of tranquil, charming and loving nature. When pleased, Rama bestows wealth. Like the Sun shining with king Dasaratha’s rays, Rama shines with king Dasaratha’s qualities of tranquil, charming and loving nature. The earth desired to have Rama, richly endowed with such virtues, possessing proven prowess, comparable to Indra and other regents of the world, as her lord. O son of the Raghus (king Dasaratha), because of your good fortune that Rama, endowed with the qualities of an ideal son like Kasyapa to Maricha was born to you for the welfare of this world. Gandharvas, uragas, devas, asuras, the inhabitants of towns and villages, all men living in neighbouring or distant regions are wish the illustrious Rama strength, health and long life. Gandharvas, uragas, devas, asuras, the inhabitants of towns and villages, all men living in neighbouring or distant regions are wish the illustrious Rama strength, health and long life. Women, young and old alike devoutly invoke at dusk and at dawn all the gods for the sake of the celebrated Rama. O Lord let the peoples' prayer be fulfilled by your blessings. king Dasaratha would like to see your son Rama of the complexion of a bluelotus and destroyer of enemies as prince regent. O bestower of boons it behoves you to install with delight and without delay your son (Rama) endowed with all virtues equal to god of the gods and committed to our wellbeing and to the welfare of this world, as your heirapparent. Thus ends the second sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.",
                "The citizens held out their palms folded like lotuses in reverence and urged king Dasaratha in all possible ways (to coronate Rama). King Dasaratha reciprocated their respect with words preasing and beneficial to them: King Dasaratha is immensely happy that you have added to king Dasaratha's incomparable resilience with your desire to see beloved eldest son Rama installed heirapparent. Having honoured them (the invitees) in return for their response, king Dasaratha addressed Vasistha, Vamadeva and other brahmins. This auspicious month of Chaitra is sacred with its blossoming groves. Let all the arrangements be made for the installation of Rama as heirapparent. On hearing this, all the members of the assembly applauded king Dasaratha tumultuously. With the tumult gradually calmed down, the lord of the people, king Dasaratha spoke this to Vasistha, a tiger among ascetics: O revered one, you should issue appropriate orders to keep ready the necessary articles required for the performance of installation ceremony of Rama. Hearing the words of king Dasaratha, Vasistha, best of the brahmins thus ordered the counsellors who stood in front of king Dasaratha with folded palms: By tomorrow early morning arrange in the place set aside for sacred fire in king Dasaratha's palace gold and other metals, gems, articles of worship, also herbs, garlands of white flowers, roasted corn, honey and clarified butter in separate containers, fresh clothes, chariot, weapons of every kind, army of four divisions, an elephant possessing auspicious marks, white fans made of Yak's hair, a standard, white parasol, a hundred golden vessels shining like fire, a bull with goldplated horns and a tiger skin.

Even the smallest items required be arranged. Let the gates of the inner apartment and of the entire city be decorated with sandalpaste and garlands. Let fragrant incense be burnt for worship. Arrange fine rice cooked with milk and curd sufficient for a hundred thousand brahmins to eat to their heart's content. At dawn tomorrow the best of brahmins be honoured with cooked rice clarified butter, curd, roasted corn and gifts in abundance. As soon as the Sun rises tomorrow, arrangements be made for Swastivachana (a benedictory utterance). Brahmins be invited and seats provided to them. Banners be fastened and royal highways be sprinkled with water. All actors and beautifully adorned courtesans should reach the second inner apartment of king Dasaratha's residence and remain seated there. Persons to cater food and other eatables and to hold garlands and gifts be stationed at all temples and other places of worship. Let all the warriors in fresh clothes, armed with long swords and fully alert enter the courtyard of the glorious king Dasaratha. The two highly selfdisciplined ascetics (Vasistha and Vamadeva), having ordered the tasks to be performed and whatever remained to be done reported to king Dasaratha. Satisfied with the arrangements, the two illustrious brahmins (Vasistha and Vamadeva) approached the lord of the earth (Dasaratha) with delight and said All things have been arranged in accordance with king Dasaratha's word of command. Thereafter the glorious king Dasaratha said to Sumantra, Bring immediately selfpossessed Rama. In response to king Dasaratha's command Sumantra, the best of charioteers said, 'so be it' and fetched Rama in a chariot. After Sumantra had gone, the kings from eastern, northern, western, southern nonAryan and Aryan countries, rulers from forests and mountains paid homage to king Dasaratha, as devatas do to Indra. After Sumantra had gone, the kings from eastern, northern, western, southern nonAryan and Aryan countries, rulers from forests and mountains paid homage to king Dasaratha, as devatas do to Indra. The rajarsi, king Dasaratha, seated among the kings like Indra amidst maruts, beheld his son Rama sitting in a chariot and approaching king Dasaratha. Rama appeared as the very image of king of the gandharvas known for his courage in this world. With long arms, Rama was extremely handsome with a countenance of the colour of moonstone possessed of immense strength, Rama walked with the gait of an intoxicated elephant. Rama captivated the eyes and hearts of men with his beauty and generosity. Rama looked like Parjanya (raingod), gladdening men scorched by heat. Even after (intensely) gazing at Rama approaching, king Dasaratha was not satiated. Rama appeared as the very image of king of the gandharvas known for his courage in this world.

Even after (intensely) gazing at Rama approaching, king Dasaratha was not satiated. Sumantra assisted Rama while alighting from that splendid chariot and followed Rama with folded palms as Rama was proceeding towards king Dasaratha. Best among men, Rama accompanied by charioteer Sumantra ascended that palace that was lofty as the peak of Kailasa mountain in order to see king Dasaratha. Rama approached king Dasaratha with folded palms and bowed low near king Dasaratha, pronounced Rama's (own) name and touched king Dasaratha's feet with reverence. Seeing beloved son Rama who was standing by king Dasaratha's side with folded hands in supplication, king Dasaratha, held Rama's folded hands and drew Rama near and embraced Rama. King Dasaratha offered Rama a seat on the lofty, glorious throne splendidly decorated with gold and gems. The lofty seat Rama occupied was illuminated by Rama resplenderce like mount Meru in the translucent rays of the morning Sun. That assembly was illumined by (the presence of) Rama like the Moon dazzling the clear autumnal sky bespangled with sparkling planets and stars. King Dasaratha was delighted to see beloved son Rama as though king Dasaratha saw king Dasaratha's own reflection adorning a mirror. The best among fathers, king Dasaratha said these words to son Rama with a smile, like Kasyapa addressing Devendra. A worthy son of king Dasaratha's worthy eldest wife, O Rama, Rama's great virtues have endeared Rama to king Dasaratha. As Rama has endeared Rama to these subjects with Rama's virtues, Rama shall assume the office of heirapparent when Pushya star is in conjunction with the Moon. Admittedly gentle by nature, Rama is gifted with virtues. O son, even though virtuous, king Dasaratha shall offer Rama counsel for Rama's good out of affection for Rama. With humility, always keep Rama's senses under control. Keep off all violations arising out of lust and anger. With Rama's behaviour keep the ministers and the people satisfied by means direct or indirect. Rama shall rule the earth by filling granaries of foodgrains and arsenals and keeping the subjects loyal and contented. The friends of such a person will memain pleased like devatas with nectar. Hence conduct Rama's self with Rama's mind under control. Rama shall rule the earth by filling granaries of foodgrains and arsenals and keeping the subjects loyal and contented.

Having heard this, Rama's friends quickly reported the matter to Kausalya so that Kausalya might be happy. The foremost of women, Kausalya ordered gifts of gold, cows and various kinds of gems to be given to the messengers who brought this good tiding. Having paid obeisance to king Dasaratha, Rama ascended the chariot amidst the acclaim of multitudes of men and left for Rama's splendid abode. On hearing such pronouncement by king Dasaratha, the citizens also felt they have got something beneficial for themselves. They took leave of king Dasaratha and hastening home, full of joy, began worshipping their gods. Thus ends the third sarga of Ayodhyakanda of the holy Ramayana, the first epic composed by sage Valmiki."
